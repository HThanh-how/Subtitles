00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,378
-Hello.
-Hot, isn't it?

2
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,508
I'm home.

3
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,513
Thanks.

4
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,267
You don't need a bag just for milk!

5
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,893
They put it in one.

6
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,105
Just say no! Pour me some, too.

7
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,065
Dad, want some barley tea?

8
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,402
Please... I'll come over.

9
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,031
-Thanks. Is the word processor open?
-I'm still printing.

10
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,618
I should buy an electronic notebook.

11
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,663
You smoke too much.

12
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,291
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.

13
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,168
No. Shiho wears me out.

14
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,171
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

15
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,715
Do you need lunch?

16
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,508
No, I'll eat out.

17
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,596
The library's busy updating
to a barcode system.

18
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,682
I like the checkout cards better.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,226
Me, too.

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,687
Hey, this isn't right...

21
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,063
What?

22
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,692
Did you leave out a line?

23
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,361
You're right!

24
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,948
Let me go first. I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.

I'm leaving!

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,361
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,989
Bye!

42
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,161
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

My purse...

44
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,877
You ran back upstairs again?

45
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,837
Yeah.

46
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,423
That's funny...

47
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,425

48
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,385
Yes!

50
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,556
I'm late! Lock the door!

51
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
Clumsy!

52
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,319
It's flying so low!

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,742
Today's a lucky day!

54
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,019
It's a hot day!

55
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,613
How's it going?

56
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,843
Hit it!

57
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,554
Hi, Shizuku!

58
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,225
Hi! Keep it up!

59
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,480
Miss Kosaka?

60
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,733
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?

61
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,985
Could I ask a favor?

62
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,738
Nothing weird, I hope...

63
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,365
Let me in the library!

64
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,491
What?

65
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,077
Can't you wait till school starts?

66
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,831
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

67
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,001
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

68
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,172
20? Don't forget you've got
high school entrance exams.

69
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,049
Hurry up!

70
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,884
Here it is!

71
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,261
Bring it here.

72
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,391
Give me your library card
and the book's checkout card.

73
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,435
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,189
No one's ever borrowed this book!

75
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,485
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?

Look what you made me do!

80
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,256
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

81
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,091
Ask an older teacher.

82
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,551

83
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:54,182
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

84
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,852
If I have to stand in the sun
I get more freckles!

85
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry!

86
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,398
Relax, Harada. You take freckles
much too seriously.

87
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,193
They're a serious problem, Miss!

88
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,489
Yeah, yeah... all right, out of here,
both of you.

89
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,245
Move up! Move up!

90
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:23,211

Why not just sing it in English?

-Yes, it is.

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,043
It's trite.

101
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,212
Yeah?

102
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,839
I wrote another one.

00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,907
But what's this "problem?"

110
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,910
You don't need the lyrics yet...

111
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,122
No... are you in love with anyone?

112
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,623
What?

113
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,794
Studying for these exams
would be easier if I had someone.

114
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,629
We could support each other.

116
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,262
You got a love letter?

00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,390
When? Who? Is he handsome?

119
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,810
He's in another class. He's not bad.

120
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,938
Meet him, then! If you don't like him,
just say no!

121
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Yeah, but...

122
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,402
So there's someone else you like!

123
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,074
You can't hide it from me! Spit it out!

128
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,337

00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,339
Come on, Tsukishima!

130
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,091
Throw it over here.

131
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,095
Shut up and go back to the bench!

going to the playoffs!

00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,850
Yuko?

134
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,199
You're in love with Sugimura?

135
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,328
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

136
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,830
Don't worry. He's too dense.

137
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,668
What about the guy who wrote you a letter?

138
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,757
I'll think about it for a while.

00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175

aren't always pushing you to study.

00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,269
-Oh, no!
-What?

144
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,022
I forgot my book! I need to go back.

145
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,107
You can ride my bike.

146
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,943
No. You'll be late for cram school.

147
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,404
I'll call you.

00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,902

Are you studying?

Don't think you can take it easy

I know!

181
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,731

184
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,865
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

185
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,992
Two kilos of it!

186
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,636
Shizuku! Get up and vacuum by your desk!

187
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,804
I'm washing the sheets.

188
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,848
And airing the bedding.

189
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
Where's Mom?

190
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,810
Long gone.

191
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,360
Put that stuff away
and go and bring Dad his lunch.

192
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,444
Me?

193
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,031
Why not? You're going to the library.

194
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,451
Shall I go instead?

195
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,956
Are you gonna clean the toilet, the tub
and the balcony and go to the store?

196
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,835
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

197
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,007
I'm going!

198
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,974
Shizuku!

199
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,643
Mail these, will you?

200
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,894
What?

201
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,105
M-A-I-L!

202
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,696
You don't have to read them!

203
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
Take the paper-clip off.

204
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,783
Your boyfriend?

205
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,784
Idiot!

206
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,998
MUKAIHARA STATION

207
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,750
NO BIKE PARKING

208
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,252
-Will you be there?
-Yeah.

209
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,655
<i>Next stop, Suginomiya.</i>

210
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,575
<i>The exit will be on the left-hand side.</i>

211
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,634
Hey kitty, are you alone?

212
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,640
Where are you going?

213
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,896
What's out there?

214
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,150
Hey! Answer me!

215
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,915
I'm getting off here. What about you?

216
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,879
See you.

217
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,811
Hey! A cat!

218
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,950
KODAMA LINE
SUGINOMIYA STATION

219
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,541
The library's that way!

220
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,485
And it felt
just like the start of a story...

221
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,814
There he is!

222
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,492
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

223
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,051
NO ENTRY

224
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,580
What a hill! How far up is he going?

225
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,142
Kitty?

226
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,853
Kitty?

227
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,735
Does he live around here?

228
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,396
Hey, kitty! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

229
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,128
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here...

230
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,806
SUZUKI

231
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,942
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

232
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,458
Maybe you're teasing me, too.

233
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,549
WORLD EMPORIUM
SHIRO NISHI, PROP

234
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,514
I never would've guessed there was
a store like this one up here either...

235
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,253
Cool!

236
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,221
Are you that cat?

237
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,152
Oh, hello...

238
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,071
-Um...
-That's all right.

239
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,948
Look around all you want.

240
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,909
Baron gets bored.

241
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,371
Baron?
Is that the name of this statue?

242
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:03,251
Yep. Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.
Quite the name...

243
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,179
Sorry.

244
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,681
Thanks. I'm fine now.

245
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,225
That's a great clock.

246
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,020
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out.

247
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,104
Look...

248
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,945
It's beautiful. What is it?

249
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,450
Wait and see.

250
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,951
What great dwarfs!

251
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:23,623
So you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, aren't you?

252
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,629
Watch the clockface... if it works.

253
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,565
A fairy!

254
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,318
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

255
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,235
All right.

256
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,116
A princess?

257
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,117
That's right.

258
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,129
Are they in love?

259
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:16,134
But they live in different worlds.
He's the king of the dwarfs.

260
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:21,723
She's a fairy when the clock strikes 12.
Then she turns back into a sheep.

261
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,727
But he appears every hour...

262
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,437
and waits for her.

263
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:33,526
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

264
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,947
That's why they both look so sad...

265
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,495
This clock's fast, isn't it?

266
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,247
Only about five minutes, though.

267
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,499
Oh, no!

268
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,127
I've got to be at the library!

269
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,755
Can I come back sometime?

270
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,009
Sure... but go left to get to the library!

271
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,439
I'm right above it!

272
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,816
TENSHU HILL

273
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,323
What a find! A place where stories start!

274
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,993
Fantastic!

275
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,913
Tsukishima!

276
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,748
Shizuku Tsukishima!

277
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,919
Isn't this yours?

278
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,677
You're forgetful, aren't you?

279
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,637
Thanks... but how...

280
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,431
Guess!

281
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,853
The cat! Is that your cat?

282
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,230
You sure eat a big lunch!

283
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,525
No!

284
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,195
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere</i>

285
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,741
It's not mine! Hey!

286
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,453
Oh, here you are...

287
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,167
What's wrong with you?

288
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,544
It's hard to explain.

289
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,382
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

290
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,260
Then what someone said buried me alive.

291
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,304
Sounds complicated.

292
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,224
Getting more books?

293
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,852
Seven more to go.

294
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,396
Still at it? What about lunch?

295
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,522
I'll buy something.

296
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,150
You will? Thanks, then.

297
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,840
June 16th...

298
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,011
Wow! Amasawa's read this one, too!

299
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,181
What's he like?

300
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,059
<i>Concrete road</i>

301
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,269
No! He's not you!

302
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,027
POE OF HAMBURG

303
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,367
Shizuku! Hurry!

304
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,161
I'm late!

305
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,539
Pass my umbrella.

306
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,587
Rain every day this term!

307
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,049
At least you're studying
because you want to.

308
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,092
Sorry.

309
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,177
Study hard!

310
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,721
Don't you worry!

311
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,563
Shizuku!

312
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,522
Hi!

313
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,274
Hurry! We'll be late!

314
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,861
I hate all these tests!

315
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,821
One every day!

316
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,494
Did you answer the letter?

317
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,621
No.

318
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,122
Did he say anything?

319
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,625
I'm going to say no.

320
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,253
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

321
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,254
Sugimura!

322
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,507
Better hurry!

323
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,052
I know!

324
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,064
Time's up. Gather the papers.

325
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,363
See you this afternoon.

326
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,991
Come over here, let's eat!

327
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,078
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

328
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,746
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

329
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,705
Sure.

330
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,166
-Tsukishima!
-What?

331
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,502
I lucked out on the test!

332
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,711
Isn't that nice?

333
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,714
Everything I studied was on it!

334
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,592
So you're not just a baseball goof...

335
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,721
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?

336
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,181
With Harada?

337
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,225
-Hey, Sugimura!
-What?

338
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,476
Did you see this?

339
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,811
Come on!

340
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,402
Stop trying to hook me up!

341
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,611
Was it obvious?

342
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,655
I never just guess!

343
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,781
Sorry!

344
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,366
TEACHER'S ROOM

345
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,617
Excuse me...

346
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,541
A library-book donor? Gee, I don't know...

347
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:25,628
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.

348
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh...

349
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,799
FAIRYTALE

350
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,050
DONATED
AMASAWA'S COLLECTION

351
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,469
That's Dr. Amasawa.

352
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,596
I've read it. It's a good book!

353
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,306
Yes, very.

354
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,101
What kind of person is he?

355
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,564
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

356
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,443
The PTA? Would you know his given name?

357
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,278
His given name?

358
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,866
Mr. Kimura, do you remember
Dr. Amasawa's first name?

359
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,119
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi.

360
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,121
Koichi Amasawa...

361
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:05,793
His youngest son, Tsukishima,
is in your year. Don't you know him?

362
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,087
He is?

363
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,922
Thank you very much!

364
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,759
Excuse us!

365
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,094
Sorry!

366
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,807
Shizuku, where are you going?

367
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,394
What a surprise!

368
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,063
Tell me about it!

369
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,232
What's up with you?

370
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,359
Sorry!

371
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,080
Hey, where are you going?

372
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,099
He ignored me! The nerve of this guy!

373
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,018
Who is he? Where are you going?

374
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,813
He's a jerk! He won't make me avoid him!

375
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,649
Oh, you're so cute!

376
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,402
I've been carrying her lunch
all over town!

377
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,156
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

378
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,661
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

379
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,496
It isn't true!

380
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,791
You met a prince from one of your books?

381
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,959
Is he handsome?

382
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,628
I just want to find out what he's like!

383
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,757
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!

384
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,509
Yuko!

385
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,719
It happened too fast.

386
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,765
"Ma", something, "Masaki", maybe...

387
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,766
Hmm?

388
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,351
Hmm...

389
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:50,273
But it's just like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

390
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,276
You want to know, but you don't...

391
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,321
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

392
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,533
How terribly romantic!

393
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:06,539
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyrics?

394
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,916
-You've finished them?
-Let's see!

395
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:15,047
O Shizuku! O great poet!
We shall not transgress again!

396
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,592
All right, then.

397
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,052
I'm not sure...

398
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:27,185
I don't know about old home towns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

399
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,353
This is great!

400
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:34,984
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

401
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:40,072
<i>If I go right to the end</i>

402
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:45,161
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

403
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:50,082
<i>To that town, country road</i>

404
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,835
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

405
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,837
It's not hard to sing?

406
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,255
We'll manage.

407
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,635
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it to the teachers!

408
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,053
There, too?

409
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,137
Slow down!

410
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,639
I like this part.

411
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:09,018
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing...

412
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:13,105
"Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."

413
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,108
-Ladies, the bell.
-Yes.

414
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,243
The sun's come out!

415
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,577
Shizuku!

416
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,957
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

417
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,376
No, I'm going to the library.

418
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,586
There's another test tomorrow...

419
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,380
I'll study there.

420
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,631
Bookworm!

421
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,300
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

422
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,170
Harada...

423
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,676
Can I talk to you for a minute?

424
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,813
It's closed.

425
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,692
Have these flowers been watered?

426
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,374
Baron's gone...
Maybe someone bought him.

427
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,759
WORLD EMPORIUM
SHIRO NISHI, PROP

428
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,347
"Shiro Nishi"...
Maybe that jerk's name is "Nishi", too.

429
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,738
Shizuku! Shizuku!

430
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,620
Yuko's on the phone!

431
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,373
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

432
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,166
Yuko?

433
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,127
What? I can't hear you.

434
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,548
I'll be there in a minute.

435
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,841
Bye.

436
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,844
-Where are you going?
-Not far.

437
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,353
What's wrong?

438
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,688
Shizuku!

439
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,316
What's the matter?

440
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,735
What am I going to do?

441
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:10,574
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

442
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,829
Uh-oh...

443
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,541
Why you, of all people?

444
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,961
Hey!

445
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,383
That guy is so dense!

446
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,929
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him...

447
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:40,855
I'll apologize to him. But I can't go
to school tomorrow looking like this.

448
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,148
And miss the test?

449
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,774
Yeah.

450
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,860
Oh.

451
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:52,158
DEVELOPMENT

452
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,547
Idiot!

453
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,384
What?

454
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,846
It was easy.

455
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,931
The library again, Shizuku?

456
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,224
I'm going to Yuko's.

457
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,351
Say hello.

458
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,478
-Bye.
-Bye.

459
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,695
Tsukishima!

460
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,198
Wait up!

461
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,789
About Harada...

462
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:53,260
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

463
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,600
She said, "Why you, of all people,"
didn't she?

464
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,103
Yeah. A guy on the baseball team asked me.

465
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,189
No!

466
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,442
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

467
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,860
Don't you understand?

468
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,695
No, I don't!

469
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,280
Tell me!

470
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:18,702
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

471
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,706
What? No way! I don't need this!

472
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,212
You don't? How do you think Yuko feels?
She stayed home sick today!

473
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,216
But... I like you!

474
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,551
What?

475
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,179
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

476
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,430
It's not a joke!

477
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,474
I've liked you for a long time!

478
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,478
Not me! You can't!

479
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,815
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?

480
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,359
I don't have a boyfriend...

481
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,653
But...

482
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,989
-I'm sorry!
-Wait!

483
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,491
Tell me the truth!

484
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:03,789
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

485
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,378
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

486
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,386
Just friends?

487
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,515
Forever?

488
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,147
I see...

489
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,572
I'm the one who's dense!

490
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,336
The parcel delivery guy left this with me.

491
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,922
Thank you... again!

492
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,355
You don't have to do this!

493
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,024
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

494
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,026
Oh, you're home...

495
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,070
Shizuku?

496
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,736
Hi.

497
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,406
Have you been shut out, too?

498
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,622
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

499
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,629
You're not very nice. Just like me.

500
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:46,637
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...

501
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,225
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

502
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,522
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy!"

503
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,482
I'm not very nice.

504
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,425
Hey! Tsukishima!

505
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,346
Moon lets you pet him?

506
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,807
Moon, you're not coming in?

507
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,725
Is that his name?

508
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,394
He's like a full moon.

509
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,397
That's why I call him that.

510
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,945
Isn't he yours?

511
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,905
He won't stay in one house.

512
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,200
I heard some neighbors named him "Ball."

513
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,619
I'm sure he has other names.

514
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,497
So he does the rounds...

515
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,459
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

516
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,211
The train?

517
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:06,216
Yes, by himself! That's how
I found this place. I followed him.

518
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,221
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

519
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,223
I insulted him.

520
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:18,729
I said he wasn't very nice. Just like me.

521
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,441
You're not like Moon at all!

522
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,236
He's half-devil, he is.

523
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,037
-Um...
-Would you...

524
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,960
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...

525
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:46,089
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

526
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,091
I'm glad he's all right.

527
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,095
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

528
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,390
That cat statue? You want to see it?
Come on.

529
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,152
Close the door.

530
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,800
It's like we're in the sky!

531
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,476
Afraid of heights?

532
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,479
No, I like high places. This is great.

533
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,655
This is the time it looks best.

534
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,572
In here.

535
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,347
Perfect timing.

536
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,349
Sit there.

537
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,934
The clock's gone!

538
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,437
The one that was there?

539
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,982
Grandpa's delivering it today.

540
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,567
Did he sell it?

541
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,278
It was just here for a repair job.

542
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,364
I wanted to see it again.

543
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,326
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

544
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,578
That lunch!

545
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,748
I know it wasn't yours.

546
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,666
Look into the cat's eyes.

547
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,796
Quick, before the sun sets.

548
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,479
<i>Engelzimmer</i>... "angel's room".

549
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,982
The artisan accidentally scratched it.

550
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,734
It's beautiful.

551
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,987
Baron won't go anywhere.
He's a treasure.

552
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,614
A treasure?

553
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,786
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

554
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,372
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

555
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,420
Turn on the light if you want.

556
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:48,688
It's weird.
I feel as if I've known you for years.

557
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,233
Sometimes I really want to see you...

558
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,615
You look sad today, somehow...

559
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,846
Had enough?

560
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,931
Yeah. Thanks.

561
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,809
Are you making a violin?

562
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,686
Uh, yeah.

563
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,314
Can I see?

564
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,695
It fits like this.

565
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,949
You made all that? By hand?

566
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,701
Sure!

567
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,411
Amazing!

568
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,789
The shape hasn't changed in 300 years.

569
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,126
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.

570
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,463
You made all those?

571
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:40,592
No way! There's a violin-making
class here.

572
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,094
But one of them is yours?

573
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,220
Yeah.

574
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,181
Which one?

575
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,432
That one.

576
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,517
This one?

577
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:54,773
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!

578
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,985
How can you say this with a straight face?

579
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,489
Why? It's what I think.

580
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,200
Anyone can do that.

581
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,244
I've got a long way to go.

582
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,587
You can play, can't you?

583
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,005
A little.

584
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,591
Play for me, okay? Please!

585
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,801
Listen...

586
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,345
Please, please, please!

587
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,181
You have to sing, too.

588
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,977
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

589
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,353
Perfect!

590
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,288
Sing. You know this song.

591
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,568
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

592
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:27,240
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

593
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:32,746
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

594
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,375
<i>And pretended I was strong as I could be</i>

595
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:43,214
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

596
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:48,762
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

597
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:54,225
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

598
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:59,481
<i>To that town, country road</i>

599
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:05,320
<i>It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be</i>

600
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:11,201
<i>I will never ever let</i>
<i>A tear show in my eye</i>

601
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:17,165
<i>If my feet are moving faster</i>
<i>That's because</i>

602
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:21,795
<i>I only want to push away memories</i>

603
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:27,425
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

604
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:33,223
<i>Could go right to my home town</i>

605
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:38,728
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

606
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:44,192
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

607
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:49,489
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

608
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:55,370
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

609
00:56:55,453 --> 00:57:01,000
<i>Want to go back there</i>
<i>Can't go back there</i>

610
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,378
<i>Fare thee well</i>

611
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,009
<i>Country road</i>

612
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,210
That was fun!

613
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,133
I'm Shizuku Tsukishima.
We met the other day.

614
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:56,139
I was hoping you'd come back again.

615
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,892
These are my musical friends.

616
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:04,898
Nice singing. You're the lucky one
who was there when he fixed the clock...

617
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,193
Seiji has some pretty friends.

618
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,947
"Seiji"? Are you Seiji Amasawa?

619
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,451
Yeah... didn't I tell you my name?

620
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,205
No! It says "Nishi" outside.

621
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,209
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

622
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,506
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen!

623
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,801
What difference does it make
what my name is?

624
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:37,013
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

625
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,516
You never asked me mine!

626
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,518
I never had the chance!

627
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,313
My image of Seiji Amasawa...

628
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,439
What?

629
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,441
was someone quiet and gentle.

630
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,527
You read too many books.

631
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,112
So do you!

632
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,173
That was fun. They're nice people.

633
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,093
Come back. They'll like that.

634
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:18,179
Just to listen, then. Singing's too hard.

635
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,684
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

636
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,603
Lots of people are as good as I am.

637
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,690
What I want to do is make violins.

638
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,693
Yeah... you're good at that.

639
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:35,989
There's a school for it in Cremona, Italy.

640
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,700
I want to go there.

641
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,202
And not go to high school?

642
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:48,042
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

643
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:03,182
It must be great to know
what you want to do.

644
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:08,146
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

645
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:13,526
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

646
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:19,490
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

647
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,078
I'll see you home.

648
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,040
No, it's not far. See you.

649
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,500
Tsukishima...

650
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,794
Yeah?

651
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,796
You've got a talent for poetry.

652
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,676
What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked "Concrete Roads", too.

653
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,763
You told me to forget that!

654
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,640
Did I say that?

655
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,682
Yes!

656
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,476
I did?

657
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,980
Thanks for everything. Good night.

658
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,295
Don't fall asleep with the light on again.

659
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:24,138
When did you decide on your future?

660
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,056
What?

661
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,808
Your future!

662
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,811
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

663
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,771
I don't mean that!

664
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,774
I'm in college trying to figure it out.

665
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:37,819
Good night.

666
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,320
Good night.

667
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,296
Mom's class is canceled
so now she sleeps in!

668
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,434
-Morning!
-Morning!

669
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,019
Run faster!

670
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,771
You go ahead!

671
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,286
HOUR 1: SPARE PERIOD

672
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,040
Great!

673
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,376
Shizuku!

674
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,295
You look awful!

675
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,131
You sure got better quickly!

676
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,009
I hear you were out with a boy last night.

677
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,094
Who told you that?

678
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,014
A little bird... who said
you were like lovers.

679
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,307
We are not!

680
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,694
Harada... I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

681
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,697
I'm sorry, too.

682
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,032
That's okay.

683
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,665
Did you see <i>Ninja Warrior</i> on TV
last night? It was great!

684
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:26,052
This formula will be on the mid-term,
so remember it!

685
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,137
-What?
-Are you serious?

686
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,055
That's all.

687
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,615
-I'm not surprised.
-I heard he rushed to get it.

688
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,911
Is Tsukishima here?

689
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,372
Amasawa? What do you want?

690
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,874
Is Tsukishima in this class?

691
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,294
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

692
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,130
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

693
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,048
A boy!

694
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,471
There she is.

695
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,183
Seiji?

696
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,769
Can I talk to you?

697
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:18,980
Yes!

698
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,275
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

699
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,069
Boyfriend! Boyfriend!

700
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,364
No, I don't!

701
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,914
What is it?

702
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,417
I'm going to Italy.

703
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,334
What?

704
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,295
Come with me.

705
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,926
-Where are we going?
-The roof!

706
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,060
Wow!

707
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:03,274
We can't talk
with all those people around.

708
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,736
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

709
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,742
Let them think what they want.

710
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,996
My dad finally gave in. On one condition.

711
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,998
What's that?

712
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:24,378
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

713
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,255
Apprentice?

714
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:31,010
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have the talent or not...

715
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,014
and if I have the patience
to stick it out.

716
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,225
Otherwise I'll go to high school.

717
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,021
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

718
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,148
but it's a good opportunity.

719
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,650
When are you leaving?

720
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:50,529
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad will be talking to the school today.

721
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,448
Soon, then...

722
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,410
Great! Your dream's coming true.

723
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,455
Well, I'll do the best I can.

724
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,000
-Um...
-Well...

725
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,296
The rain's stopping.

726
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,547
Yeah...

727
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,217
Look over there.

728
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,724
There might be a rainbow...

729
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:34,782
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

730
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:40,538
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

731
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:45,001
It's great. You're on your way.

732
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,044
I feel like a fool.

733
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:51,007
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school...

734
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,552
What a stupid thing to think...

735
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,018
Found them!

736
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:16,907
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

737
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,953
We passed each other all the time
in the library.

738
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,957
I even sat next to you.

739
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:31,714
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

740
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,341
I...

741
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:39,555
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

742
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,686
Me too.

743
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,482
Don't push!

744
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,490
Hey!

745
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,410
Look out, she's mad!

746
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,120
So scary!

747
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,122
Run!

748
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,533
-Here.
-Thanks.

749
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,659
Excuse me.

750
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:44,453
Finished already?

751
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,914
I'm meeting Yuko.

752
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,253
If you're by the station, get some milk.

753
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,504
What?

754
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,674
You're the one who drinks it all!

755
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,010
She's slacking off these days.

756
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,950
-Did I make you skip cram school?
-It's all right.

757
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,035
My head's in a whirl.

758
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,580
Hello, Shizuku.

759
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,747
Hello.

760
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:32,793
Hi.

761
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,503
Hello.

762
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,300
-I'll make some tea.
-Okay.

763
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,262
Dad and I aren't speaking.

764
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,229
Boys are so lucky!

765
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:59,486
When he comes back to graduate,
he'll leave again for ten years!

766
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,822
That's like forever!

767
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,327
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

768
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:11,665
It was too good to last.
Two people who read the same books...

769
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,336
except one's moving forward
while the other stays behind.

770
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,379
Yeah...

771
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,800
Kinuyo was in his class for a year.

772
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:26,347
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

773
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,809
Don't tell me that, will you!

774
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,353
I just feel worse!

775
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:36,315
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you so!

776
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,442
Now I'm not so sure...

777
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:47,368
I don't get it. I'd write every day...
We'd support each other...

778
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,872
You can't say "go for it" to someone
who's more ambitious than you.

779
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,041
Maybe...

780
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,879
But I don't understand what you want.

781
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,216
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?

782
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,804
You're talented.

783
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:10,516
All the juniors liked
your translation of "Country Roads".

784
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:14,353
You can express yourself, too...
Unlike me.

785
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,525
-"Lots of people are as good as I am."
-What?

786
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,610
That's what he said.

787
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,614
He's going to find out
if he's talented enough. Well, so will I!

788
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,869
I'll write a story!

789
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,623
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

790
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,334
But it's exam time...

791
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:41,463
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

792
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,382
-You going?
-Yeah.

793
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,512
Good night.

794
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,515
-Say "hi" to your mother.
-Yes.

795
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,270
You go for it, too.

796
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,441
I'm sure Sugimura will realize
how great you are.

797
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,444
-Bye.
-Bye.

798
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,450
It's so easy!
I just have to do something, too!

799
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,496
Moon?

800
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,377
Muta?

801
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:24,089
Mom! Muta's gone again!

802
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:25,758
Muta!

803
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,010
"Muta"...

804
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,557
"WHISPER OF THE HEART"
LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE WOODS

805
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,518
LISTEN TO THE FOREST'S VOICE...

806
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,962
Baron as the hero?

807
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,382
Would you mind?

808
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:11,845
I ask because Seiji says
you treasure him...

809
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,973
You didn't have to ask!

810
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:19,228
Of course you can. But on one condition.

811
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,064
Yes?

812
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:26,777
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

813
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,904
Um...

814
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,864
All right?

815
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:36,245
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not...

816
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,126
It's the same for a craftsman.

817
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,504
Don't expect perfection at first.

818
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,298
Here, let me show you something.

819
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,390
This.

820
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:01,854
Look at it.

821
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,781
It's called "mica slate".

822
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,159
Look at the seam.

823
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,202
Like that...

824
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,590
It's beautiful!

825
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:34,970
It's called "beryl".
You find it in emerald ore.

826
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,098
-Emerald? The gem?
-Yes.

827
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,852
You and Seiji are like this stone.

828
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,105
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

829
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,442
I like stones that way.

830
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:53,447
But making violins and writing stories
is different.

831
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:59,244
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

832
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,121
It takes time and effort.

833
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,834
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

834
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,127
Yes.

835
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:12,424
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

836
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,553
The smaller part inside is purer.

837
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:21,850
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

838
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:26,355
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.

839
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,653
I'm scared. What if there isn't
a beautiful crystal in me?

840
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:37,366
But I want to write. And you'll be
the first one to see it.

841
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,494
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

842
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:52,673
A rough stone... Lapis lazuli...

843
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,555
Let us go forth together...

844
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,558
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

845
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,522
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

846
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:16,196
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

847
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,868
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

848
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:31,378
Make haste! The planetoids are converging!

849
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,226
Good! We're riding the wind!

850
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,396
Straight up to that castle!

851
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,773
It's so high!

852
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,610
It's not so high once you're there!

853
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:18,383
Go! When the air currents mingle
in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

854
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,552
ARCHITECTURE
MANUFACTURING

855
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,762
Huh?

856
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,931
NATURE
FOLKLORE

857
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:30,395
That's unusual!
Shizuku looking at non-fiction.

858
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,905
PYRITE
AGATE

859
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:41,990

CAT FOLKLORE

861
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:50,749
HISTORY OF EASTERN EUROPE

862
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:04,012
WHEN HE WAS IMPRISONED
(FRANCESCO FERIO)

863
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,604
He's making a violin in his cell...

864
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,888
Seiji!

865
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,016
I thought you were gone!

866
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,270
Grandpa said I might find you here.

867
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,023
I leave tomorrow.

868
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,692
Tomorrow...

869
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:05,115
Don't worry. I'll wait here
till you're done.

870
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,518
Sorry I can't walk you home.

871
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:36,772
That's okay. I'm glad you came.

872
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,400
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

873
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,736
It's only two months.

874
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:55,165
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

875
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,424
I'll see you, then.

876
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,513
Have a good trip!

877
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:32,994
Luisa, my betrothed, and I
were born in a distant land.

878
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,669
<i>In that town, magic still lived...</i>

879
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:45,966
<i>and in the veins of its artisans</i>
<i>flowed the blood of sorcerers.</i>

880
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,977
<i>It was a doll maker's apprentice</i>
<i>who fashioned us...</i>

881
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,440
<i>but Luisa and I were happy...</i>

882
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:07,195
<i>because he had made us</i>
<i>so we could love others.</i>

883
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,614
<i>But then...</i>

884
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:17,956
Shizuku...

885
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,583
Shizuku!

886
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,544
Shizuku!

887
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,049
What's going on? Tsukishima!

888
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,887
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

889
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,639
Pay attention! This is important!

890
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:35,724
Sorry, sir.

891
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:37,559
Harada, you read.

892
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,476
Yes.

893
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,398
You were up until four again?

894
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,067
It's okay. I'm not sleepy at all.

895
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:51,156
But you're spaced out all the time!
Like just now...

896
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:55,619
I was thinking. I've got to organize
what I want to write.

897
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,873
I'm not hungry.

898
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,251
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 18TH

899
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,196
Shizuku? So you are home...

900
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,990
Turn on the lights!

901
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:37,911
At least you could bring in the laundry!

902
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,373
Shizuku! Come here!

903
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,586
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

904
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,713
She's not hungry.

905
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,616
-Thank you for coming.
-Sorry to trouble you.

906
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:20,161
This way... Is anyone
in the guidance office?

907
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,079
Yeah.

908
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:22,914
Please.

909
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,547
I'm back!

910
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,051
Hello.

911
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,595
You're home early, Shiho.

912
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,516
I'm beat!

913
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:42,851
Want some coffee?

914
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,102
Yes, please.

915
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,816
Mom, can I talk to you?

916
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,276
What?

917
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,783
I'm thinking of moving out.

918
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,161
I've found a place.

919
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:03,288
But can you afford it?

920
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,999
I've saved from my job.

921
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,544
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

922
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:14,382
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

923
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,260
I'll talk to your father.

924
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,180
You will? Great!

925
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:26,519
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working...

926
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,271
but I'll help you out then.

927
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,356
Sounds good.

928
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,526
I'm sorry I'm doing this now
during your master's thesis...

929
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,861
Thanks.

930
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,990
You helped me enough with the data.

931
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:44,788
And Shizuku will be able to concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

932
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,498
You think so too?

933
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,502
The school called me. Look at this.

934
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,712
What is it?

935
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:56,800
She's gone down a hundred spots!

936
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:02,180
She's at her desk all the time...
what's she doing?

937
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,481
Good evening.

938
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,191
Hello.

939
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:16,861
Excuse me.

940
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:25,995
What high school will take you
with grades like this?

941
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,248
I'm not going to high school!

942
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:34,129
Use your head! You think
a junior high education is enough?

943
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,756
I can decide my own future!

944
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:38,550
Watch your mouth!

945
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:43,221
Face the facts! The school will write
the report after the second term!

946
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,265
You're a fine one to talk!

947
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,601
You didn't study!
You just work part-time jobs!

948
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,146
I do what I have to!

949
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:55,900
You're the one who isn't doing that!
Don't you understand?

950
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:59,779
I've got something more important to do!

951
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:03,116
Like what? Tell me.

952
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:07,453
Shiho, Shizuku... that's enough.

953
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:10,790
But Dad... listen to this girl!

954
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,711
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

955
01:26:14,794 --> 01:26:17,255
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

956
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:21,009
Come on.

957
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,770
MID-TERM TEST RESULTS
3RD YEAR, CLASS 5, SHIZUKU TSUKISHIMA

958
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:38,985
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

959
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:41,362
I do care about my grades!

960
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,865
You just said you weren't going
to high school.

961
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:46,701
You said I wouldn't get into one!

962
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:51,331
Shiho... can Shizuku and I talk
alone for a bit?

963
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:52,415
Yes.

964
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,252
Where's your mother?

965
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,670
At the Tanakas.

966
01:26:58,421 --> 01:26:59,255
I'm back.

967
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,299
Hi, Mom.

968
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,343
-Is your dad back?
-Yeah.

969
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:08,181
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

970
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:09,265
Coming.

971
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,148
All right, Shizuku...

972
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:23,196
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

973
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,784
Can you tell me what it is?

974
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,703
When it's time.

975
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,041
Is this something
you have to do right away?

976
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,753
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

977
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,632
I'm challenging myself.

978
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,050
I have to.

979
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,512
Challenging yourself? How?

980
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,766
How will we know if you won't tell us?

981
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:56,646
Is it something you can't even tell us?

982
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,148
Seiya!

983
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,276
Oh... sorry.

984
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:17,458
Whatever you're doing at the library,
I admire how hard you're working.

985
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,546
Let's let her do what she wants.

986
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:25,258
Not everyone has to be the same.

987
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:31,556
I should know that more than anyone...

988
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:36,477
Okay, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

989
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:41,399
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

990
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,736
You've only got yourself to blame.

991
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,824
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

992
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:51,909
Yeah. We're a family.

993
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:52,827
Yes.

994
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:54,746
Call Shiho.

995
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,292
I'll make some tea.

996
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,713
Shizuku...

997
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:10,011
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

998
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,014
I know. It's written on his face.

999
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,642
I'm moving out next Sunday.

1000
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,020
You'll have your own room.

1001
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,230
You're leaving home?

1002
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,232
Yep. So smarten up!

1003
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:35,536
Hurry!

1004
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,872
Hurry!

1005
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,876
Only one is real.

1006
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:44,462
Which one is the real one?

1007
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,546
Hurry!

1008
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,048
Hurry!

1009
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,383
Hurry!

1010
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:33,362
Luisa... you've finally come...
but I've grown so old...

1011
01:32:00,264 --> 01:32:01,599
Shizuku...

1012
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:06,062
Come in... I was fast asleep.

1013
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,859
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

1014
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:18,449
It's finished?

1015
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:23,955
I promised you'd be the first to read it.

1016
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,998
It's a novel!

1017
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:29,585
"WHISPER OF THE HEART"

1018
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:34,590
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

1019
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:40,096
But you've worked so hard on it...
shouldn't I take my time?

1020
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:45,726
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

1021
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:48,896
My heart's pounding...

1022
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:52,358
I see. I'll read it right now.

1023
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:55,736
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

1024
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,202
Now we won't be bothered.

1025
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:10,543
Can I wait downstairs?

1026
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,005
It's okay. I'm not cold at all.

1027
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:19,510
Of course... but...

1028
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,377
Are you sleeping?

1029
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:36,754
Shizuku... I'm finished.

1030
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:41,550
Thank you. It's very good.

1031
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,302
It's not!

1032
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:47,223
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

1033
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:50,810
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

1034
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:55,147
Yes... it's rough, blunt, unfinished...

1035
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,441
just like Seiji's violin.

1036
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:05,408
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

1037
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,703
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.

1038
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:15,584
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

1039
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:43,779
It's cold out here. Come inside.

1040
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:44,905
Now...

1041
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:48,534
Now that I've written it I get it.

1042
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,245
Wanting isn't enough.

1043
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,039
I have to learn more...

1044
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:59,587
but Seiji's getting
further and further ahead.

1045
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:05,050
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared...

1046
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:09,930
You like Seiji, don't you?

1047
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,578
How does it taste?

1048
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:34,914
It's very good.

1049
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:41,921
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

1050
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:44,131
Jumbo size.

1051
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:50,471
Thank you.

1052
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,351
Now, where was I?

1053
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:58,812
You found Baron in a coffee shop...

1054
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:00,689
Yes, in Germany...

1055
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:06,820
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...

1056
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,949
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

1057
01:37:11,283 --> 01:37:12,910
But he wouldn't.

1058
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:17,957
Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.

1059
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:24,880
<i>He was waiting for her to come back</i>
<i>while she was being repaired...</i>

1060
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,966
<i>at the doll maker's shop.</i>

1061
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,011
Just like in my story!

1062
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,682
Yes... quite the coincidence!

1063
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:38,978
I had to go back to Japan,
so I'd just about given up.

1064
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:43,232
Then a lady friend of mine...

1065
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:47,528
<i>told me that when the other doll</i>
<i>came back, she would pick it up...</i>

1066
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:50,281
<i>so the two dolls could be reunited.</i>

1067
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:53,033
<i>So the owner gave in.</i>

1068
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:57,496
<i>I ended up leaving Germany</i>
<i>with just Baron.</i>

1069
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:04,128
<i>I promised her I'd come back,</i>
<i>and asked her to keep the other doll.</i>

1070
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:08,591
<i>The day the dolls met again...</i>

1071
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:12,303
<i>would be the day we'd be reunited.</i>

1072
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:19,310
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

1073
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:26,275
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

1074
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:32,531
But there was no trace of her,
or the Baron's lover.

1075
01:38:33,782 --> 01:38:37,202
She must have been very dear to you...

1076
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:44,335
Your story brought the Baron
out of my memory and back to life.

1077
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,253
Oh, yes...

1078
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,555
Hold out your hand.

1079
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:03,979
But...

1080
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:08,484
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1081
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:12,988
Now, finish up your story.

1082
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:13,947
Yes.

1083
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:31,340
Thank you!

1084
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,762
Goodbye!

1085
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:48,440
I'm home.

1086
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,067
Hi.

1087
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:53,946
Where's Dad?

1088
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:58,117
In his bath. Where were you at this hour?

1089
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:03,956
I'm sorry I worried you. Today I'm back
to studying for my entrance exams.

1090
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,959
So your challenge is over?

1091
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:08,502
For now.

1092
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:13,090
Did you eat? There's curry...

1093
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:14,049
I'm fine!

1094
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,469
"For now"...

1095
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:30,607
Shizuku, the bathroom's free.

1096
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,004
Ah, the warrior rests.

1097
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,341
There we go.

1098
01:41:58,987 --> 01:42:00,072
No!

1099
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:09,498
Wait there!

1100
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,140
It's a miracle! You're here!

1101
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:28,684
We're not dreaming?

1102
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:32,020
I got an earlier flight. Hop on.

1103
01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:35,899
Wait... you'll be cold.

1104
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,486
Climb on.

1105
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:42,155
I'll get a coat.

1106
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,408
No time! Get on.

1107
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,328
Hang on tight.

1108
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:57,880
I was out there calling you in my head.

1109
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,464
"Shizuku!"

1110
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:02,801
And then you appeared!

1111
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:04,469
What a team!

1112
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:09,516
Me, too... it's like I'm still dreaming!

1113
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,232
How was Cremona?

1114
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:20,903
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1115
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,071
It's getting light!

1116
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:33,498
Shall I get off?

1117
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:34,625
It's all right.

1118
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:40,797
I made up my mind I was going
to take you all the way up this hill!

1119
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,591
That's not fair!

1120
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:47,721
I'm no man's burden!

1121
01:43:50,974 --> 01:43:54,311
I want to be useful!

1122
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,522
Okay! Push!

1123
01:43:58,273 --> 01:43:59,399
Almost there!

1124
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,833
Shizuku! Hop on!

1125
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:36,311
We made it!

1126
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:43,318
-I'll hold the coat.
-I'm fine.

1127
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:47,823
Here...

1128
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:08,552
Wow! In the mist, it looks
just like the sea!

1129
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:12,806
This is my secret spot. It's almost time.

1130
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,686
I wanted you to see this.

1131
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,817
Grandpa told me everything.

1132
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:10,864
I didn't do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.

1133
01:46:10,947 --> 01:46:14,034
No... you were the reason I did it.

1134
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:19,873
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1135
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:25,420
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.

1136
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:28,006
Listen, Shizuku...

1137
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:32,803
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1138
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,680
would you marry me?

1139
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:41,269
I'm going to be a violin maker...
and then...

1140
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:47,734
You mean it?

1141
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:51,029
That's exactly what I wanted.

1142
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:53,281
Yeah? Great!

1143
01:46:53,782 --> 01:46:56,827
Wait... it's cold...

1144
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:00,163
Shizuku... I love you!

1145
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:13,552
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

1146
01:47:14,177 --> 01:47:19,891
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

1147
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:26,064
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

1148
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:31,611
<i>And pretended I was strong as I could be</i>

1149
01:47:31,903 --> 01:47:37,576
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1150
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:44,374
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

1151
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:50,797
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

1152
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:58,054
<i>To that town, country road</i>

1153
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:08,106
<i>Tired of walking, I stop and stand</i>

1154
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:13,945
<i>Thinking back on my hometown</i>

1155
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:20,452
<i>But that road leading up the hill</i>

1156
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:26,082
<i>Is telling me to move on</i>

1157
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:32,088
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1158
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:38,470
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

1159
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:44,809
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

1160
01:48:45,477 --> 01:48:48,563
<i>To that town</i>

1161
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:53,068
<i>Country road</i>

1162
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:27,769
<i>It doesn't matter to me how sad I might be</i>

1163
01:49:27,852 --> 01:49:33,441
<i>I'll never ever let a tear show in my eye</i>

1164
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:40,657
<i>If my feet are moving faster</i>
<i>That's because</i>

1165
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:46,037
<i>I only want to push away memories</i>

1166
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:52,252
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

1167
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:58,758
<i>Could go right to my home town</i>

1168
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:05,432
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

1169
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:11,730
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

1170
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:17,736
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

1171
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:24,242
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

1172
01:50:24,868 --> 01:50:30,582
<i>Want to go back there, can't go back there</i>

1173
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:35,045
<i>Fare thee well</i>

1174
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:38,757
<i>Country road</i>
