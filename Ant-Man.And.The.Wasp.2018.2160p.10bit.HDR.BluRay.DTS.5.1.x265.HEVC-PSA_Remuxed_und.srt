1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,638
<i>I still think
about the night</i>

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,473
<i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i>

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,318
Hopefully,
it's not for long,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,312
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,456
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Mommy?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,073
Jellybean.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,635
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,071
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,357
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,559
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,836
eyes...

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,390
Janet, we gotta go.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,756
<i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i>

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,991
<i>tucked you back
into your bed...</i>

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,433
<i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i>

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,439
They've already launched.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,716
We have to stop it.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Come on.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,872
<i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i>

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,839
<i>but the plating was too thick.</i>

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,913
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,840
I can't get through.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,156
Hank.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,357
<i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i>

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,590
<i>there is no coming back.</i>

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,669
<i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i>

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,831
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,997
Tell Hope I love her.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
<i>She turned it off.</i>

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,956
Janet. No!

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,512
<i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i>

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,389
<i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i>

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,037
<i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i>

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
<i>Alone.</i>

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>Afraid.</i>

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,439
<i>Gone forever.</i>

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,160
<i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i>

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,594
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,234
But then Scott showed up.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,918
<i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i>

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,596
<i>and came back.</i>

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,994
<i>Everything changed.</i>

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,878
I started to wonder...

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,636
could your mother
still be alive?

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,273
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,997
Dad, what are you saying?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,676
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,677
Okay. We're in.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,957
Oh, this place is a maze.

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,998
Where's that map?

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,599
We're definitely close.

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,558
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,439
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

60
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,716
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,837
I eat fear for breakfast.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,469
Wow. That is super cool.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,710
Come on.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,158
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,198
Anton, which way do we go?

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,872
Anton, which way do we go?

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,990
Thanks, Anton!

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,639
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,519
Oh no, lasers!

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,677
Oh! I think I got lased!

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,156
The secret vault.

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,117
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,919
Yup.

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,989
Perfect! Right there.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,350
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

76
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,159
My trophy?

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,836
It looks like treasure.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,275
Oh, it is to me.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, no, you can't do that.

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,318
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,557
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm so touched you think

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,632
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
It was the only one they had.

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,999
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,470
Oh, no, the fuzz!

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,471
Hey, Scotty...

89
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,736
I was looking
at the schematics

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,194
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,430
and I think we have

92
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,936
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,189
No, no, not at all.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,896
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,070
I know what he needs.

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,958
Who's the security expert
in our business?

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,917
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
And if we overquote him...

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,176
he's gonna go somewhere else.

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,917
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,275
He ain't goin' anywhere.

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,656
And the expression is
"land this fish."

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,114
No, it's "land the bird."

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,416
Just like you land the plane.

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,696
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,995
I know it's silly
to get hung up

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,594
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,910
How am I gonna land a fish?

109
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,958
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,276
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,475
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,552
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,949
Now, if you just excuse me...

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,712
I'm in the middle of trying to

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,472
steal something
with my daughter.

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,676
I'm gonna go recheck it.

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,395
To the escape ant!

118
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,314
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,393
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,552
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,796
Crash landing!

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
Whoo!

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,234
I wish we could shrink
for real.

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,919
Oh. That is pretty cool.

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,536
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

127
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
But I feel
like I'm way better.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,000
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,196
And my hands are shaking.

130
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,696
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,836
It's gonna be great, Luis!

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
You got nothing
to worry about!

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,709
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,176
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,634
Daddy!

136
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,115
Why would I try to escape?

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,999
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,816
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,479
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,234
Thank you.

142
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,471
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,955
Our flying ant crashed.

144
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,376
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
when you can't leave
the house.

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,871
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

147
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,719
Close-up magic.

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,790
I learned that.

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,358
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,519
Oh, Cassie.

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,876
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

152
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,474
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,313
Well, think of it this way.

154
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,199
Your school has rules, right?

155
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,192
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

156
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,272
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,317
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,836
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,037
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,953
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

161
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,351
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,233
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,710
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

164
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,599
followed by three years
of probation.

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,559
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,837
or contact with any
former associates who were...

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,232
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Or any related statutes.

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,235
Okay, sweetie?

170
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,710
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,758
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

172
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,511
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
but you haven't had
any contact

174
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,719
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

175
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,354
- No.
- You sure?

176
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,536
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,075
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,074
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,357
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,239
that any violation
of your agreement

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,039
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,669
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

183
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,956
They hate his guts.

184
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Thanks, peanut.

185
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
How'd you do it, Scott?

186
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,716
Do what?

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,832
The card trick.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,470
Seriously?

189
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,633
Oh, my God!

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,110
You people
can't just show up here

191
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,759
whenever you want
and search the place.

192
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,956
Actually, they can.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,871
You need a warrant.

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,116
Actually, they don't.

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
Really? Wow.

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,039
Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,317
- Yeah.
- All right.

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,190
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,953
All right.

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,039
Oh, get on the inside of this.

201
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,834
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,256
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,776
You know what?
Give me another one.

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,871
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

205
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,635
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,393
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

207
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,472
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Once I'm outta here,

209
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,056
you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,357
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

211
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
You're gettin' good at that.

212
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,436
How'd you do that?

213
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

214
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,039
- Bye.
- Bye.

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,154
Three days.

216
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
Easy-peasy.

217
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,159
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,158
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

219
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
<i>We had a dream</i>

220
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,953
<i>We'd go travelin' together</i>

221
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,198
<i>We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on</i>

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,319
Easy-peasy.

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,834
<i>Where are you?</i>

224
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,516
<i>Everything
that you know...</i>

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,515
<i>Lost...</i>

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,076
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,794
<i>What?</i>

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,231
I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,394
I found you!

230
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,989
You always find me, Mommy.

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,392
<i>What the hell?</i>

232
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,436
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,070
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

234
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,594
And I'm probably
the last person

235
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,239
you wanna hear from.

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,556
But I just had
a really weird dream.

237
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,836
And I know that doesn't

238
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,216
sound like an emergency
or anything...

239
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,393
but it just felt very real.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,038
I was back
in the quantum realm...

241
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,233
and I think I saw your wife.

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,357
And then I was your wife.

243
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,354
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

244
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,870
You know,
hearing this out loud,

245
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,316
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

246
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,472
I'm sorry to bother you.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,116
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

248
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,397
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,793
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

250
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Hope?

251
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
Is this another dream?

252
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,696
Do you think it was a dream...

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,315
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm not sure.

255
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,280
I can't be here!

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,079
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

257
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,074
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

258
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,674
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

259
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,016
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

260
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,156
you're still at home.

261
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,314
Whoa!

262
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Scotty?

263
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,296
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

264
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,674
Nine hours in bed.

265
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
Five hours in front of the TV.

266
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,277
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

267
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,874
That's totally inaccurate.

268
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,796
Are you spying on me?

270
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,776
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

271
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,837
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

272
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,270
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

273
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
They said it was
a matter of national security.

274
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,669
That Cap needed help, so...

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,069
Cap?

276
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,953
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

277
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,918
It's what we call him.

278
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,550
If you're a friend.

279
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,976
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,036
He's nice. Whatever.

281
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,195
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

282
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

283
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,470
How's Hank?

284
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,776
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

285
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,029
How do you think he is?

286
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,032
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

287
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

288
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,560
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

289
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,193
because we need
what's in your head.

290
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,952
Is this where you're living?

291
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,355
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

292
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,874
We're fine.

293
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,191
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

294
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,194
Save it!

295
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,710
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,231
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

297
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,756
we were building this.

298
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,757
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

299
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,029
To my mom.

300
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,376
We think she might still
be down there.

301
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
We just don't know where.

302
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
What?

303
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,072
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

304
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,152
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

305
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,656
You built all this
and you don't even know

306
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,875
if she's alive?

307
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,952
It's called a hypothesis.

308
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,840
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,117
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

310
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,879
But for a split second,

311
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

312
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,870
And?

313
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,158
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

314
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,136
We think
when you were down there,

315
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,514
you may have entangled
with her.

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,720
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

317
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,071
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

318
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,475
We think she might have put

319
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,936
some kind of a message
in your head.

320
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,758
Hopefully, a location.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,513
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

322
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,279
Your mom put a message
in my head?

323
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,999
Come on. That's insane.

324
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,196
No, Scott.

325
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,716
Insane is going to Germany

326
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,156
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

327
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,438
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

328
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

329
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,756
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,798
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

331
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,319
That was my life's work!

332
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,709
What was I supposed to do?

333
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,634
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

334
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm sorry, Hank!

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,354
I'm sorry I took the suit.

336
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,636
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

337
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,816
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

338
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,035
I wish that I did.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,111
I just had a dream about her

340
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

341
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
What?

342
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,274
I had a dream.

343
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,080
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

344
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,038
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

345
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,395
Doesn't mean anything.

346
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,517
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
No.

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,036
Where was she hiding?

349
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,554
- What?
- The little girl.

350
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,757
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

351
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,035
No, it was in a tall dresser.

352
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,356
You mean a wardrobe.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,636
Is that what that's called?

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
What color was it?

355
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Red.

356
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,800
Were there horses on it?

357
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,476
Oh, boy.

358
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,513
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

359
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,196
It doesn't sound like

360
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,317
you really got the gist
of the game.

361
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,514
She's alive.

362
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,919
I knew it.

363
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,194
I knew it!

364
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,114
We need to get that part.

365
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,475
Okay.

366
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,896
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

367
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,536
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

368
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Does Burch have it?

369
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,216
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,357
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,319
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

372
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,914
from overloading again.

373
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,675
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

374
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,112
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

375
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,336
but if I'm not at home
when they come

376
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
to take off
my ankle monitor...

377
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,034
then I'm going away forever.

378
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,240
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

379
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,280
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

380
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,516
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

381
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
You owe us.

382
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,158
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

383
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,920
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

384
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,314
Let's go.

385
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,314
- We good?
- Yeah.

386
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,034
I'll be right back.

387
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,676
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

388
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,118
Ah. Susan! Welcome to <i>Oui!</i>

389
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,919
Sonny!

390
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,912
<i>Oui</i> is French
for "yes."

391
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,320
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

392
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,995
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

393
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,753
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

394
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

395
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

396
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,316
Have a seat.

397
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
No, I'm good. Thank you.

398
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,835
Who is this guy?

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,038
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

400
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,760
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

401
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,395
Could I just have one...

402
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
No.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,632
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

404
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,870
And I say "special"...

405
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,879
because, well,
he tells me things

406
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,599
that I didn't previously know.

407
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,879
For example...

408
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,838
your name isn't Susan.

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,231
It's Hope Van Dyne.

410
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,673
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

411
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,957
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

412
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,558
What do you want?

413
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,871
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

414
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,475
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

415
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,710
Our relationship?

416
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,634
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

417
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,736
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

418
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,672
but now, Hank Pym...

419
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,196
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

420
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,430
Do you have a point?

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, you think
that I don't know

422
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,236
what you've been building
with all this?

423
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,392
Quantum technology.

424
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,435
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

425
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,715
forget cryptocurrency.

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,439
Quantum energy is the future.

427
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,313
It's the next gold rush.

428
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Is that so?

429
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,040
I want in, Hope.

430
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,669
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

431
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,911
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

432
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,676
Starting bid...

433
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,432
one billion dollars.

434
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,193
Thank you, Sonny, really.

435
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,616
But my father and I
have something

436
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,030
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

437
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,358
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

438
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,716
My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

439
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
So, we are
either in business together...

440
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,589
or we aren't
in business together.

441
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,437
Then I guess we aren't.

442
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,432
You can go.

443
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,355
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

444
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

445
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,594
Listen, Sonny.

446
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,514
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

447
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,114
if you just give me
that component.

448
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,240
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

449
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,956
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

450
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,750
Okay.

451
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,674
So, now what?

452
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,956
You'll see.

453
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,736
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

454
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,936
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

455
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,176
because if they're not working
with us...

456
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,816
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

457
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,956
I want some names...

458
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,393
Hold on, you gave her wings?

459
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Get her.

460
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,559
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

461
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,713
Stop firing! Stop!

462
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,834
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

463
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,430
Go!

464
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,599
Wings and blasters.

465
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,776
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

466
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
No, I did.

467
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,076
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

468
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,709
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

469
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,553
I can assure you of that!

470
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,878
What in the hell is that?

471
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,194
Dad,
are you seeing this?

472
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Hope, get out of there!

473
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,553
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

474
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,193
It is still
a work in progress.

475
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,096
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

476
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,315
Yeah, great form.

477
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,416
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

478
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Not the time, Scott.

479
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,076
Damn it, where'd it go?

480
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
I've lost it.

481
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

482
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,799
<i>Try looking...</i>

483
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Dad?

484
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,278
Give me that.

485
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Now.

486
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
- Are you okay?
- No!

487
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
He got the lab.

488
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,197
No.

489
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Come on!

490
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,956
What was that?

491
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,435
I don't know.

492
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,432
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

493
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,352
and figure out
where the lab is.

494
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,309
So, where to now?

495
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,319
How about my house? Hmm?

496
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,616
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

497
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,816
and Woo could walk in
any second.

498
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,071
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

499
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,435
What about your house?

500
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,319
Sorry.

501
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,200
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

502
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
No.

503
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,995
No, no, no, no!

504
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
No!

505
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,315
Wow, Dr. Pym...

506
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
who would've thought that,

507
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,280
once again,
in your hour of need...

508
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,397
that you would turn to us,
you know?

509
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Not me.

510
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,878
Mmm. Help yourself.

511
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,296
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

512
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

513
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

514
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,796
The oatmeal packets.

515
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,513
Oatmeal packets.

516
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,273
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

517
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,560
Because it tastes like sand.

518
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,096
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

519
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,315
It's not organic, it's sand.

520
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,736
It's the most important meal
of the day.

521
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,557
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

522
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,676
Break teeth.

523
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,136
Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.

524
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,336
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

525
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,239
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

526
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,039
We got bigger fish to fry.

527
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,674
Is that my desk?

528
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,393
- Yeah.
- What?

529
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,994
Why do I have
such a small desk?

530
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,776
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

531
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You snooze, you lose.

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,797
Well, I was
under house arrest.

533
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,631
Yeah.

534
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,016
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

535
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,871
This is garbage.

536
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,680
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

537
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,995
I got it at a rummage sale.

538
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
So, you save money
on my desk?

539
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Guys.

540
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,917
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

541
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,271
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

542
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
like what happened to you.

544
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,176
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,873
Like a ghost.

546
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,560
Like Baba Yaga.

547
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
Baba Yaga, the witch.

548
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,074
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

549
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,674
You know Baba Yaga?

550
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,074
Whoever stole it...

551
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
we need to find it.

552
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,277
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

553
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,193
Like Baba Yaga.

554
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,076
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

555
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,590
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

556
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,870
Because if you didn't,

557
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,917
we have a variety
of affordable options.

558
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,471
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

559
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,115
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

560
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,232
They also looked like
they were phasing.

561
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Phasing?

562
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,159
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

563
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
through different states
of matter.

564
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,473
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,670
The lab emits radiation.

566
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

567
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,195
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

568
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,317
Where else can we find
that equipment?

569
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,073
Well, there is one person.

570
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,435
Bill Foster.

571
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Great!

572
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,194
Who's Bill Foster?

573
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,477
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

574
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,359
They had a falling out
years ago.

575
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,376
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

576
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,392
It's probably
just a waste of time.

577
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,512
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

578
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
Don't you think
we should check?

579
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,356
We need to find out
who took the lab.

580
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
Guys,
it's not a good idea

581
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,874
to be out in the open
like this.

582
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,874
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

583
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,396
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

584
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
That's not a disguise, Hank.

585
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,316
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

586
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,358
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

587
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,077
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

588
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,431
If the system
is interfered with,

589
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,718
that stability becomes chaos.

590
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,672
Unpredictable.

591
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,230
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

592
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,752
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

593
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,196
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

594
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,990
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

595
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,680
In other words,
the object in question

596
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,433
would be both
in and out of phase...

597
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,832
with multiple
parallel realities.

598
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,350
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

599
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
I am noticing
an unusually high number

600
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,670
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,714
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

602
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,030
That'll be enough for today.

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,873
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

604
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,634
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

605
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,756
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

606
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,638
Posner molecules
in your brains.

607
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,240
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

608
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,391
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

609
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
in front of everything?

610
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,239
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

611
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,754
Hope, I'd love to help you...

612
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,558
but I don't have anything

613
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,391
like the equipment
you're describing.

614
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,680
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

615
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,960
Don't condescend, Hank.

616
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,112
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

617
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,112
All because
you had to grow to a size

618
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,919
that finally fit your ego.

619
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,391
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

620
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Really?

621
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,151
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

622
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,591
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

623
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,836
Actually, I do.

624
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,713
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

625
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,553
on a project called Goliath.

626
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,074
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

627
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,197
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

628
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,192
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

629
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,720
Right...

630
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,960
I don't know.
How big did you get?

631
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,880
My record? 21 feet.

632
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,434
- Not bad.
- You?

633
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,431
I don't...

634
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
No, really, I'm curious.

635
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,233
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

636
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,079
- Huge.
- 65.

637
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,630
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

638
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,956
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

639
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,113
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

640
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,959
Strange.

641
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,873
You had all the answers
back in the day.

642
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
That's why I left the project.

643
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,512
Left? I fired you.

644
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,880
Best decision
I ever made.

645
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,117
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,351
stubborn, impatient.

647
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,477
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

648
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Just the mediocrities.

649
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,231
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

650
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,390
and chose to stick it out.

651
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
Watch it, Bill.

652
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,160
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

653
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,356
You son of a bitch.

654
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,676
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

655
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm trying to save my mother.

656
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,280
Now, which office
would you say?

657
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Oh, it's Woo.

658
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,674
Someone must have seen me.

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,029
Relax. If this is about you,

660
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,918
they'd be in your house
by now.

661
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
What are you, 15?

662
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,776
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

663
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,872
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

664
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,536
if you modify
the diffraction units

665
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,630
on one of your regulators.

666
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,072
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

667
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,272
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,159
But, Doctor,
campus police says

669
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,038
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

670
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,536
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

671
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,517
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

672
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,816
I can assure you
I'm the last person

673
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,876
he would want to visit.

674
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,176
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

675
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Hey, hey.

676
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Why is that?

677
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,880
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

678
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
So I'm a terrible partner?

679
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,916
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

680
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,150
in his unremarkable career.

681
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

682
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,273
Fine, one decent idea.

683
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,318
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

684
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,278
when I upgraded the suits.

685
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,877
So, if we had an old suit,

686
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,077
we might be able
to track down the lab?

687
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
Yes, but we don't.

688
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,679
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

689
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,196
I mean...

690
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,436
life's funny.

691
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,552
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

692
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,551
What?

693
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,951
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

694
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,594
I couldn't destroy that.

695
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,150
Before I turned myself in,

696
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,576
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

697
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,910
You sent my suit
through the mail?

698
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,073
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

699
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,477
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

700
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Where is it?

701
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,230
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

702
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,080
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

703
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,776
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

704
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

705
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,696
Hey, get away from the plant.

706
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,680
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

707
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,354
Show-and-tell.

708
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Scotty?

709
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
No, stop!

710
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,471
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

711
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,296
Whenever you go
back to school...

712
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,176
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

713
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,634
This place seems huge.

714
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>What is it?</i>

715
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,096
It's the new regulator.

716
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,032
Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

717
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,759
How much of
a work in progress is this?

718
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,392
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

719
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Oh.

720
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,597
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

721
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,240
Okay, okay.

722
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
<i>What do you see?</i>

723
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,917
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

724
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,394
Just let me...

725
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,273
Ow!

726
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,230
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

727
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,236
Okay.
All right.

728
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,154
Try that.

729
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,310
Sorry.

730
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
What?

731
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Awesome.

732
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,277
If only Cap could see you now.

733
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,432
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

734
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,680
Hey!

735
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,956
Where's your hall pass?

736
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,440
Hey, I'm talking to you.

737
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Hey!

738
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,153
Hey. Eh...

739
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,672
You can do it.

740
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,951
You almost got it.

741
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,873
Oh, peanut.

742
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,834
Okay, let's go.

743
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,036
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

744
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,556
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

745
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,160
So cranky.

746
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

747
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,037
Do you really have that?

748
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,273
Let's see
if Foster was right.

749
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,233
This has gotta be the lab.

750
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,190
Let's go get it.

751
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah.

752
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,274
This seems right.

753
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,673
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

754
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,320
Makes you think, huh?

755
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,516
About what?

756
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,353
Germany.

757
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
What do you mean?

758
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,234
We were working together,
training together...

759
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,835
and other stuffing together.

760
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,357
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

761
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,079
I guess we'll never know.

762
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,754
But I do know one thing.

763
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
What?

764
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,794
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

765
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,960
Hey, Scott.

766
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,351
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

767
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,960
long enough to get my lab?

768
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,952
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

769
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,119
Okay, you're transmitting.

770
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,536
What took you so long?

771
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,916
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

772
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,396
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

773
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You like it?

774
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,190
Hilarious.

775
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,136
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

776
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,311
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

777
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,431
<i>Be careful.</i>

778
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,760
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

779
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,136
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

780
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,760
- How do you know?
- Look.

781
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,714
That's Ghost?

782
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,155
What is she doing?

783
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,496
Do you think
that suit is how

784
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,273
she goes through walls
and stuff?

785
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,496
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

786
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,671
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

787
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,352
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

788
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,536
and not
somebody else's, right?

789
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,800
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

790
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'll get it.

791
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh, shit...

792
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,029
Hope. Hope! Hank.

793
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,954
Guys.

794
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,316
I don't think
they can hear you.

795
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,155
Hi.

796
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,234
I'm Ava.

797
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,915
Scott.

798
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,913
So, you don't need the suit...

799
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,792
to go through things.

800
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,590
No.

801
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,470
It just helps me control it.

802
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,710
And the pain, supposedly.

803
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,576
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

804
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,954
and crush my heart, are you?

805
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,154
You're funny.

806
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,039
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

807
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,473
I need...

808
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,632
what's in your head.

809
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,040
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

810
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,360
and get this over with,
shall we?

811
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,356
Get up!

812
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Come on!

813
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,030
Dad?

814
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,277
Don't ever touch him again.

815
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,840
Now, now, Hope...

816
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,496
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

817
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,715
all things considered.

818
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,439
What the hell
are you talking about?

819
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,637
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

820
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Bill.

821
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,199
What have you done?

822
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,200
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

823
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,074
You're with her?

824
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,471
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

825
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,233
What the hell
is going on here?

826
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,871
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

827
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,315
Why would he?

828
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,551
Elihas Starr.

829
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,915
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

830
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,400
Quantum research.

831
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,154
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

832
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,000
You had him fired.

833
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,231
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

834
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,719
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

835
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,959
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

836
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
No, no, no!

837
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Too many.

838
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,357
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

839
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,874
He told us to run.

840
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,871
Elihas, what's happening?

841
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,440
Just go. Go!

842
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,831
Daddy! Daddy!

843
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,275
<i>I could tell
he was scared.</i>

844
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,711
Daddy!

845
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,950
Ava, no!

846
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,998
<i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i>

847
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,755
No! No!

848
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,751
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

849
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,238
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

850
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,033
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i>

851
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,077
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

852
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,119
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

853
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,356
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

854
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,074
and stitched back together.

855
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,593
Over and over.

856
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,353
Every day.

857
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,792
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

858
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,600
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

859
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Hello, Ava.

860
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,516
My name's Bill.

861
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,158
I was a friend
of your father's.

862
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,595
I brought you something.

863
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,271
It's all right.
Try again.

864
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,069
That's it.

865
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,114
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

866
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,280
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

867
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,000
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

868
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,833
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

869
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,479
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

870
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,959
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

871
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

872
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,279
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

873
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,394
<i>Killed for them.</i>

874
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,951
And in exchange for my soul...

875
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,033
they were going to cure me.

876
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,113
They lied.

877
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,640
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

878
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,838
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

879
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,216
but her condition
was progressive.

880
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,360
I didn't know how to cure it.

881
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,714
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

882
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,216
and that she should
watch you instead.

883
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,720
And sure enough,
she discovered

884
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,120
that you were
building the tunnel.

885
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,159
Then, she told me about Lang.

886
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,789
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

887
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,416
that's when I...

888
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Christ's sake!

889
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,954
That's me. I'm sorry.

890
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,633
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

891
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,393
"Cassie, 911."

892
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,472
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

893
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,869
No, that's not happening.

894
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,912
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

895
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,759
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

896
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,917
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

897
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,856
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

898
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,634
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

899
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,038
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

900
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,919
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

901
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,031
What?

902
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,270
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

903
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,656
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

904
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,176
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

905
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,600
No, I can't do that right now.

906
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,513
<i>- Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.

907
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,776
<i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i>

908
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,856
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

909
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,200
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

910
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,595
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

911
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,513
- Bye, peanut!
<i>- Feel better!</i>

912
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,680
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

913
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,555
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

914
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,553
Ava, I want to help you.

915
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,720
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

916
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,109
Oh, really? How?

917
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Janet.

918
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,976
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

919
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
absorbing quantum energy.

920
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,514
We can extract that energy.

921
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,990
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

922
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,991
Extract it?

923
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,230
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

924
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,993
That would rip Janet apart.

925
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,994
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

926
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,435
When Janet's location

927
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,016
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

928
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,838
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

929
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,672
What?

930
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,593
You are gonna
stay here...

931
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,752
just in case I need your help.

932
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,074
Like hell I would help you!

933
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,435
You'll do whatever I say.

934
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,776
You're gonna kill Janet!

935
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,632
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

936
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,269
Goddamn it, Bill!

937
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,200
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

938
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,075
So help me God...

939
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,752
The pills.

940
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,434
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

941
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,479
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

942
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,240
He could die!

943
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,436
Come on!

944
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Help him!

945
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
Dad, just hang on,
all right?

946
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,555
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

947
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,035
Help him, man! Come on!

948
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
The Altoid tin!

949
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Wait!

950
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Thanks, guys.

951
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,470
Hank!

952
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,955
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

953
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,358
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

954
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,876
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

955
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,595
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

956
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,514
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

957
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Good job.

958
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
It'll work.

959
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,232
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

960
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,560
Look, we'll adjust the relays

961
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,520
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

962
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,233
It's going to be fine.

963
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,111
So, this is it.

964
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,237
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

965
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,874
to prepare I'd be more ready.

966
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,953
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

967
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,510
It kind of melts your mind.

968
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,512
I mean seeing my mom again.

969
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,830
Oh.

970
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,711
What if she's a completely
different person?

971
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,315
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

972
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,834
I'm serious, Scott.

973
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,073
Or George Jefferson.

974
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,957
What if she's forgotten
about me?

975
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,157
When I was in prison...

976
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,880
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

977
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,416
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

978
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,794
I never would have
forgotten her.

979
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,072
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

980
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,117
until she can see you again.

981
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,870
Thank you.

982
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,237
Hey.

983
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,720
We got a big problem.

984
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,791
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

985
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,677
on the back of the building.

986
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,320
Oh, no.

987
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,994
And they're on the proposal,

988
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,696
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

989
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,111
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

990
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,976
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

991
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
No. No, no, no, no.

992
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,256
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

993
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,680
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

994
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,872
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

995
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,176
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

996
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,635
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

997
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,075
And you can fix them there.

998
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,480
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

999
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
It's complicated.

1000
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,040
What do you mean
it's complicated?

1001
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,117
As you can see, sir,

1002
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,271
this system
is state of the art.

1003
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,671
Security of tomorrow, today.

1004
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,990
Oh, that's so good!

1005
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,816
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

1006
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,856
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1007
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,880
so we can fix the plans.

1008
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,536
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1009
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,836
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

1010
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,456
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1011
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,039
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

1012
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,656
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

1013
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,909
Well, you said get the works.

1014
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,296
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1015
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,470
He's right.

1016
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,357
The undercarriage wash,

1017
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,954
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

1018
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,318
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1019
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,736
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

1020
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,955
about car wash protocol?

1021
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,473
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1022
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,109
And I do my research, Luis.

1023
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,677
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

1024
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,479
at the FBI that you are

1025
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,199
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

1026
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,319
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

1027
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,120
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

1028
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,636
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

1029
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,474
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

1030
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,160
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

1031
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,357
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1032
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,435
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

1033
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,479
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1034
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,515
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1035
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,040
Now...

1036
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,032
Uzman is a master

1037
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,157
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

1038
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,794
through psychoactive means.

1039
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,120
Oh, is that truth serum?

1040
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,712
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

1041
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,234
That's just nonsense from TV.

1042
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,993
Well, what is it then?

1043
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,759
It's a little concoction

1044
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,560
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1045
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,599
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1046
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,896
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

1047
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,637
No, it's not.

1048
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,838
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1049
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,037
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

1050
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,520
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1051
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,000
It's not a truth serum.

1052
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,357
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1053
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,590
The truth serum.

1054
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,513
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

1055
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,512
so you might wanna think
about that.

1056
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,113
We've got to get
that lab back.

1057
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,480
What?

1058
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,710
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1059
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,079
How long have I got?

1060
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,959
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1061
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,551
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1062
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
How?

1063
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,111
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

1064
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,316
You can't mean that.

1065
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,880
Ava!

1066
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,760
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

1067
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,672
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

1068
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,416
You're not the one who's about

1069
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,193
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

1070
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,396
I am!

1071
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,077
You said you could fix me!

1072
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,433
You promised.

1073
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,432
I know. I will.

1074
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,875
But not like that.

1075
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,477
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

1076
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,429
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1077
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,673
Fine.

1078
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,631
There are other options.

1079
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,676
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1080
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,040
Because I don't feel anything.

1081
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,919
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1082
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
This is truth serum!

1083
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
There's no such thing!

1084
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,794
Okay.

1085
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,111
Okay, okay.

1086
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,596
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1087
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,194
Okay.

1088
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,312
Where is Scott Lang?

1089
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,920
Well, see, that's complicated.

1090
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,976
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1091
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,520
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

1092
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,256
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

1093
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,320
<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

1094
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,376
<i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i>

1095
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,496
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

1096
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

1097
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,816
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

1098
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,216
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

1099
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,469
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i>

1100
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,816
<i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i>

1101
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,016
<i>"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i>

1102
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,056
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1103
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,776
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

1104
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,016
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1105
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,190
with where Scott Lang is?

1106
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,197
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1107
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,629
You put a dime in him,

1108
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,056
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

1109
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,799
He like human jukebox.

1110
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,776
Oh, my <i>abuelita</i> had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1111
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,996
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

1112
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,696
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

1113
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,320
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i>

1114
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
<i>Then</i>, iadios!

1115
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,000
What can I say?
We relate to his

1116
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,400
melancholy ballads,
you know?

1117
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,789
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

1118
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,096
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

1119
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,216
and he starts working
for Hank.

1120
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,536
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

1121
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,914
<i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i>

1122
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,593
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

1123
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1124
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,976
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

1125
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,096
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

1126
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,376
<i>"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i>

1127
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

1128
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,576
<i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i>

1129
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,431
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

1130
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,936
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

1131
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,016
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i>

1132
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,776
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

1133
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,234
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

1134
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,616
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

1135
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,256
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

1136
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,714
<i>"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been</i>

1137
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,553
<i>"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i>

1138
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,856
<i>But fate brought 'em
back together.</i>

1139
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,976
And then Hope's heart
is all...

1140
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,593
<i>"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...</i>

1141
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,496
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

1142
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
And then
my heart is all, like...

1143
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,776
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

1144
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,656
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

1145
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,511
"Out of business"?

1146
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,680
"Days away"?

1147
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,720
Damn truth serum!

1148
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,911
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

1149
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,960
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

1150
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,951
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

1151
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,096
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

1152
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,236
That's terrible bossing!

1153
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Damn, bro!

1154
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,120
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

1155
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,199
Enough.

1156
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,358
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1157
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,034
Where is Scott Lang?

1158
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,216
I've been trying to tell you,

1159
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,376
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

1160
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,720
Emotionally speaking.

1161
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,918
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1162
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,355
Oh!
The woods.

1163
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,680
The woods?

1164
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,280
Baba Yaga!

1165
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,959
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1166
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,296
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

1167
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,436
off the Panoramic Highway!

1168
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,716
For God's sake!

1169
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,399
<i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i>

1170
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,791
<i>Little children, sleepy tight</i>

1171
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,713
Damn it!

1172
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,800
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

1173
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,474
I'm never gonna see it.

1174
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,716
So, what do we do now?

1175
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,759
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

1176
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,160
than from the boogeyman.

1177
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,752
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

1178
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,630
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1179
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,096
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1180
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,873
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1181
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,077
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1182
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,393
Understood.

1183
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,193
Good news, gentlemen.

1184
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,556
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1185
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,118
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1186
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Right.

1187
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,676
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

1188
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,915
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1189
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,879
Ooh, I love leads.

1190
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,830
System's in the green.

1191
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,593
Priming the coils.

1192
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,996
Full charge.

1193
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,336
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1194
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,496
let us know
if you get anything

1195
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,616
that could be a part of
her message.

1196
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,960
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1197
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,634
Okay, then.

1198
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Here it goes.

1199
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,753
We did it!

1200
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,794
You got anything?

1201
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nothin'.

1202
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,790
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1203
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,474
No.

1204
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,199
No, no, no, no!

1205
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
What's happening?

1206
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,240
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1207
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,640
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1208
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,816
Then what else
could it be?

1209
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,638
I don't know!

1210
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,216
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

1211
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
Scott, you can't...

1212
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,040
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1213
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,315
I need to fix the algorithm.

1214
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,870
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1215
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,713
I've thought about it a lot.

1216
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,196
Janet?

1217
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,440
Hi, honey.

1218
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,400
Jellybean.

1219
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,155
Mom?

1220
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,799
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1221
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,713
It's all so rushed.

1222
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,190
You two have done
such great work.

1223
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,317
You just need a little...

1224
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,995
nudge.

1225
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,755
Janet,
how is this possible?

1226
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,714
It wasn't a message you put

1227
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,160
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1228
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,839
Clever girl.

1229
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,317
I'm so proud of you.

1230
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,193
Honey, tell us where you are.

1231
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,959
Tell us how to find you.

1232
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,952
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1233
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,480
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1234
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,040
You have to follow my voice.

1235
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,550
Of course!

1236
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,598
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1237
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,678
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1238
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,116
between point two
and point nine.

1239
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,794
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1240
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,256
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1241
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,873
Look at us squabbling again.

1242
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,435
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1243
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,997
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1244
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,113
Bullseye.

1245
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,875
Source lock.

1246
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,554
It's you.

1247
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,757
We got it!

1248
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,471
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1249
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,155
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1250
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,470
It's very dangerous,

1251
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,597
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1252
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,320
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1253
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,880
You have two hours.

1254
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,856
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1255
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,896
and it'll be another century

1256
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,354
before they align
like this again.

1257
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,512
We'll find you.

1258
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,395
I know you will, Jellybean.

1259
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,440
Nope.

1260
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,432
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1261
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,636
Perfect.

1262
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,120
How did we get up here?

1263
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,816
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1264
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,136
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1265
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,880
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1266
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,480
Scott, I'll be fine.

1267
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,296
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1268
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,640
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1269
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,712
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1270
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

1271
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,040
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1272
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,280
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1273
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,709
- What?
<i>- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1274
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,256
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1275
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,077
And then all of a sudden

1276
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,360
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1277
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,176
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1278
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,429
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

1279
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,576
- Uh...
<i>- But you need to go home...</i>

1280
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,216
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1281
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,240
And by the way...

1282
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,875
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1283
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,920
I feel like such a jerk.

1284
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,390
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1285
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
What?

1286
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,711
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1287
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,950
How?

1288
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,032
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

1289
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,256
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1290
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,440
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1291
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,670
Oh, my God!

1292
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,834
Look, we need
to land that account.

1293
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,160
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

1294
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,157
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1295
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,071
to find work these days?

1296
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,640
Jesus, Scott!

1297
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,760
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1298
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,673
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1299
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,557
I know!

1300
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,200
I'm really sorry...

1301
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,515
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1302
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,160
I have to go.

1303
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,599
Can I borrow the suit?

1304
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,560
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

1305
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,354
<i>Powering on.</i>

1306
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,438
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

1307
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,877
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1308
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,599
- Don't bother.
- What?

1309
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,896
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1310
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,120
as soon as we've found my mom.

1311
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,311
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

1312
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,518
- Scott?
- Daddy?

1313
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,750
It's us, buddy!

1314
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,156
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1315
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,676
He must be resting.

1316
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,016
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

1317
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,110
and look under your bed?

1318
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,431
Daddy, you upstairs?

1319
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,033
Daddy?

1320
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
What the...

1321
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,995
He really lives
like a pig these days.

1322
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,395
Daddy?

1323
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,633
Spread out!

1324
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Again?

1325
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,360
You people have no shame!

1326
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,496
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1327
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1328
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,192
Cassie, let the man get by!

1329
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,919
But Daddy's super sick!

1330
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,275
I'll see about that!

1331
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,320
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1332
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,755
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1333
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,111
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1334
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,760
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

1335
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,912
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1336
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,720
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1337
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,599
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

1338
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
No!

1339
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,511
Woo!

1340
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,271
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

1341
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,440
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

1342
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,710
I told you.

1343
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,197
Excuse me.

1344
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,829
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1345
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,315
Sorry.

1346
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,514
I'll start the van.

1347
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,876
You get the lab.

1348
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,198
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1349
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,714
Hank Pym...

1350
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,314
Hope Van Dyne...

1351
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,630
you're under arrest.

1352
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
This is harassment!

1353
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,796
Actually, it's not.

1354
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,440
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1355
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,956
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

1356
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,477
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

1357
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,349
Damn it!

1358
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,910
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1359
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,151
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1360
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,474
Seriously? Yes!

1361
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,520
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1362
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,313
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1363
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,754
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1364
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,400
Anyway, I'll be back later

1365
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,000
for the official end
of your sentence!

1366
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,879
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1367
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,077
You should feel great
about yourself!

1368
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,960
What is it?

1369
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,216
We have a man down.

1370
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,993
And Pym's lab is gone.

1371
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Hey.

1372
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,839
Thanks for covering for me.

1373
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,036
Sure.

1374
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,075
So...

1375
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,359
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1376
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,594
Not long.

1377
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,433
It just sort of happened.

1378
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,273
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1379
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,159
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1380
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
Daddy, it's okay.

1381
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,516
It's not.

1382
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,960
I do some dumb things...

1383
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,396
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1384
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,560
Mainly you.

1385
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,991
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1386
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,437
I screw it up
just about every time.

1387
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,838
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1388
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,229
like a partner.

1389
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,317
Well, she's made it clear

1390
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,896
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1391
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,036
Who?

1392
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,520
Hope.

1393
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,274
Wait, who did you think?

1394
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Me.

1395
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,876
You?

1396
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,554
Don't laugh.

1397
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,400
I'd be a great partner.

1398
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,278
Aw, peanut.

1399
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,639
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1400
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,031
I would be a terrible dad.

1401
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,680
Fine.

1402
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,560
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1403
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,799
She reminds me of you.

1404
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,437
You gonna go help her?

1405
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,638
I think you should help her.

1406
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,792
I wish I could...

1407
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,519
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1408
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,399
You can do it.

1409
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,797
You can do anything.

1410
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,994
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1411
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,518
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1412
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,637
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1413
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,076
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1414
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,956
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1415
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,511
All right, what's our plan?

1416
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,879
To shrink that wall.

1417
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,276
It looks load-bearing.

1418
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,590
The ceiling could collapse.

1419
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,274
Then we run like hell.

1420
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,591
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1421
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,680
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1422
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,080
They're all heavily armed.

1423
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,356
Not great odds.

1424
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,196
You got any better ideas?

1425
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
Nope.

1426
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,112
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1427
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,233
She'd be so proud of you.

1428
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,640
Okay.

1429
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,960
One...

1430
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
two...

1431
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
Scott?

1432
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,736
What're you two
just standing around for?

1433
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,194
We gotta go find that lab.

1434
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,155
What about me?

1435
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,715
Perfect.

1436
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,840
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1437
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,434
Okay, now what?

1438
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,159
You're asking me?

1439
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,950
Get in!

1440
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
Hi.

1441
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
Hi.

1442
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,673
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1443
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,736
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1444
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,672
until they start shooting
at us?

1445
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,594
Yeah.

1446
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,680
- Hey, Burch.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1447
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
Yeah, they're out.

1448
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,274
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1449
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1450
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,790
How could this happen?

1451
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,673
I mean, what the dickens?

1452
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,480
Thank you.

1453
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,476
You're welcome.

1454
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,595
So, uh, how do we find
the lab?

1455
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,080
After we lost it
the first time...

1456
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,959
I put on a new tracker...

1457
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,793
of sorts.

1458
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,240
That'll work.

1459
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,759
Is it ready or not?

1460
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,795
We can begin
the extraction process.

1461
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
Listen, Ava.

1462
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,759
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1463
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,750
Maybe we should...

1464
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,480
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1465
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,757
I've got days until I'm dead.

1466
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,430
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1467
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,592
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1468
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,960
We don't have much time before

1469
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,296
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1470
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,152
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1471
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,296
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1472
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,296
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1473
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,470
So, we should do that.

1474
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,791
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1475
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,395
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1476
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,717
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1477
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,270
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1478
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,994
Let's call it 2-A.

1479
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,514
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1480
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,256
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1481
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,680
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1482
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1483
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,637
Scott!

1484
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,816
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1485
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,559
I'm going to dive.

1486
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,560
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1487
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,758
together,
protecting the tunnel.

1488
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,750
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1489
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,311
Let me get her.

1490
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,597
I think he's right.

1491
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,911
"Whassup?"

1492
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,630
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

1493
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,714
"Whassup?"

1494
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,553
I had him follow us.

1495
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,599
I thought we could use
some help.

1496
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,400
All right.
I'm in position.

1497
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,596
The ants are headed in.

1498
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,955
<i>Copy that.</i>

1499
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,440
<i>Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.</i>

1500
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,236
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

1501
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,479
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1502
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,077
By the way, I love that suit!

1503
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,193
Thanks, man.

1504
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,275
I wish I had a suit.

1505
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,559
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1506
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,390
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1507
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
What is it?

1508
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,037
Don't know.

1509
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,076
It's them!

1510
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,070
They can't be far.

1511
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,839
All right, Hank. Hank?

1512
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,674
Dad, what's your status?

1513
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,752
Foster's taken care of.

1514
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,479
Suiting up now.

1515
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,633
I just wanted to save Ava.

1516
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,440
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1517
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,636
She's afraid.

1518
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,553
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1519
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,319
I promise.

1520
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,995
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1521
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,713
Good luck, Hank.

1522
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,839
Thanks, Bill.

1523
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,194
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1524
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,711
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

1525
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,680
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

1526
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1527
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,076
No, nothing yet.

1528
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,230
Ava!

1529
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,117
Call off the ants, Scott.

1530
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,430
Oh, boy!

1531
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,296
Can I get a status report?

1532
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,120
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1533
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,430
Ready to dive.

1534
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,192
- In case I don't make it...
<i>- Don't.</i>

1535
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,954
Don't say that.

1536
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,312
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

1537
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,795
I love you, Hope.

1538
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,631
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1539
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
Now.

1540
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,989
Misdirection.

1541
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,736
One of the first things
they teach you

1542
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,116
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1543
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
No!

1544
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,954
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1545
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,216
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1546
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,560
Okay, on my way!

1547
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
Oh, no.

1548
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,830
Really?
This guy again?

1549
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,116
Who?

1550
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,272
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1551
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,549
Change of plans.

1552
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Hang on.

1553
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,352
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1554
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Hold on.

1555
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,633
That undercarriage is filthy!

1556
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,234
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1557
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,816
Hope, what're you doing?

1558
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,216
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1559
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,310
<i>Don't worry,</i>

1560
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,616
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

1561
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,711
Wait, what're you... Oh.

1562
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1563
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,634
We're gonna die!

1564
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,557
<i>Signal lost.</i>

1565
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,070
What the hell
are they doing up there?

1566
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,074
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1567
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,198
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1568
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,156
You never said
it was so beautiful, Scott.

1569
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,913
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1570
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,757
Okay, any time now.

1571
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,157
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1572
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,679
<i>- Recalibrating.</i>
- Come on.

1573
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,790
<i>Signal restored.</i>

1574
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,114
Bikes, it's all you.

1575
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,473
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait! Whoa.

1576
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,600
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1577
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,234
Be careful up there!

1578
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,471
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1579
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,674
Oh, you got pezed!

1580
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
Up here!

1581
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,280
Oh, that's not good.

1582
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,393
Hope!

1583
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
- No!
- No!

1584
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,536
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1585
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,596
Get the lab!

1586
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,911
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1587
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,751
Hope! Wait!

1588
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,440
Hey, what about me?

1589
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,515
We got you now, Ava!

1590
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,231
Whoa! Oh!

1591
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,314
Not again!

1592
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,400
Piece of junk!

1593
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,280
Ah! Yes!

1594
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,233
Go, go, go, go, go!

1595
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,117
Burch got the lab.

1596
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,399
I'm going after him.

1597
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,120
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1598
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,639
Work in progress, my ass...

1599
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,216
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

1600
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,754
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

1601
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,136
I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1602
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,719
<i>We're running
out of time.</i>

1603
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,515
<i>Warning,
approaching quantum void.</i>

1604
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,952
I'm coming to you, honey.

1605
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,069
Guys.

1606
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,233
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

1607
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,656
We can't grow
the lab without it.

1608
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,830
Get it to us fast.

1609
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,120
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1610
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,760
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1611
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
What?

1612
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,957
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1613
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,496
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1614
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,520
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

1615
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,076
Huh?

1616
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,080
Awesome!

1617
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,336
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1618
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,555
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

1619
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,790
I'm on my way.

1620
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,997
Right. I'll get the lab.

1621
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
Hi.

1622
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,156
Oh, that's badass!

1623
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,195
Nice.

1624
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Doink!

1625
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,714
Come here, you little weasel!

1626
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,599
No, you don't!

1627
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,631
I guess maybe you do.

1628
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,871
Come on!

1629
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,352
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1630
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,996
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1631
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,120
Would you just one time,

1632
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,600
please work!

1633
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,680
Yes!

1634
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,156
All right, I need help.

1635
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,430
Yes!

1636
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,670
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1637
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,640
Somebody!

1638
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,194
Hey! Come on, man!

1639
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,720
Not cool!

1640
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,075
Murderers!

1641
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1642
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,919
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

1643
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,400
You're a badass!

1644
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,360
Yes!

1645
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,875
No, no, no!

1646
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,633
Ant-onio!

1647
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,656
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

1648
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,558
<i>dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

1649
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,757
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

1650
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,115
Listen, Uzman...

1651
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,640
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

1652
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,239
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

1653
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,476
In three hours.

1654
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,936
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

1655
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,758
<i>but it looks like
we got some company.</i>

1656
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,016
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

1657
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,236
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

1658
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,755
What the...?

1659
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,600
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1660
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,996
It's okay. It's okay!

1661
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,755
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1662
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,991
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

1663
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,640
No, no! No, no!

1664
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,896
You're embarrassing
yourself now.

1665
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,833
Come on. Let go.

1666
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
Thank you.

1667
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,119
I'll take this now.

1668
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,319
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

1669
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,680
<i>A message in your head.</i>

1670
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,190
<i>I had a dream.</i>

1671
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,033
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

1672
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,776
<i>It's where I hid
every time that we played.</i>

1673
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,836
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

1674
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,635
Daddy?

1675
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,435
Daddy?

1676
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,279
Dad?
What's going on?

1677
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,590
Why haven't you found Mom?

1678
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,520
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1679
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,910
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1680
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,598
It's me.

1681
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,037
I'm so sorry...

1682
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,549
it took so long.

1683
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,995
No.

1684
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,796
No.

1685
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,034
You're here now.

1686
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,800
Let's go home.

1687
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,480
I thought I was gone.

1688
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,239
But that energy
from your hands...

1689
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,834
how did you do that?

1690
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,639
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1691
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,280
This place...

1692
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,277
it changes you.

1693
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,272
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

1694
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,635
evolution.

1695
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,191
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

1696
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,715
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

1697
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,120
I should probably tell you

1698
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,112
what we're dealing with
up there.

1699
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,600
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1700
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,076
Move.
Move.

1701
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,712
Move!

1702
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,032
Get out of the way.

1703
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,790
Let's go.

1704
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,070
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

1705
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,114
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

1706
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,032
Get out of the way!

1707
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,072
I got the lab.

1708
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,155
The air feels chunky.

1709
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,879
Oh, no. He's too big.

1710
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,840
Scotty!

1711
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
Scott!

1712
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,832
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1713
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,879
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1714
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,554
I just need five minutes.

1715
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,036
Five minutes!

1716
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,435
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

1717
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,195
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

1718
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,951
Move!

1719
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,919
Move! Move!

1720
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,880
No, wait!

1721
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,959
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

1722
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,280
They did it.

1723
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,680
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

1724
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,439
Let's go see our daughter.

1725
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,916
Scott!

1726
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,794
Scott!

1727
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,997
Scott, come on, wake up!

1728
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,635
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

1729
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,114
Gotcha.

1730
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,430
Scott?

1731
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,718
Hey.

1732
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,629
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

1733
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,632
Did you get crushed
by the building?

1734
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,240
Where's the remote, Luis?

1735
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,553
It's probably in there.

1736
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,680
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1737
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,639
I guess
this is where we say...

1738
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,754
<i>Adiós, amigo.</i>

1739
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,920
No, no, no, no!

1740
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Thanks, guys.

1741
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
Ava?

1742
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,880
Ava!

1743
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,240
Ava!

1744
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,754
Almost ready for extraction.

1745
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,151
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1746
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,835
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1747
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,593
What if Hank is right?

1748
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,399
What if this process
kills Janet?

1749
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,829
What, you're worried
about her?

1750
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,040
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1751
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,275
She may be able to help.

1752
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,915
Oh, she will help. Right now!

1753
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,912
And if she dies, she dies!

1754
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,800
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1755
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,952
We have to find another way.

1756
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,112
This is the way.

1757
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,515
Janet!

1758
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,760
She started
the extraction.

1759
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,792
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1760
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,960
No!

1761
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,480
Hope!

1762
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,510
Are you okay?

1763
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,238
Mom?

1764
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,760
Oh, my God.

1765
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,273
We found you.

1766
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,873
I missed you so much.

1767
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,796
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1768
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,516
It's okay.

1769
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,673
I'm here now.
We have time.

1770
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,711
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1771
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,112
I promise.

1772
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,320
No, it's okay!

1773
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,233
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1774
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,153
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

1775
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,879
Scott.

1776
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,719
Miss Van Dyne.

1777
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,913
It's nice to...

1778
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,514
Well, I guess
we've already met.

1779
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,070
Yeah. I guess we have.

1780
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,280
Wait.

1781
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,994
Your pain.

1782
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,200
I can feel it.

1783
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,035
It hurts.

1784
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,038
It always hurts.

1785
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,474
I'm sorry.

1786
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,671
I think I can help you.

1787
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,917
Did you know
she could do that?

1788
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,759
It's okay.

1789
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,600
Guys, the cops are coming!

1790
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,960
Whoa.

1791
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,874
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1792
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,152
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

1793
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,509
What about them?

1794
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,317
Hands in the air!

1795
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,716
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

1796
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,056
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1797
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:38,312
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1798
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,472
We traffic
in stolen technology.

1799
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,518
And we have killed many,
many people.

1800
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,160
Uh, he's in charge.

1801
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,320
That's true, I am.

1802
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,230
I've also committed

1803
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,516
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1804
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,876
Some of them would shock you.

1805
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,190
It is truth serum.

1806
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,793
We gotta get outta here.

1807
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,519
Fast.

1808
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,200
I have an idea.

1809
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,016
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

1810
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,496
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

1811
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,556
<i>All units move in.</i>

1812
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,080
Go, go!

1813
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,594
There he is!

1814
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,280
It's over, Scotty!

1815
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,557
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

1816
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,232
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1817
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,720
There's nowhere to hide.

1818
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,638
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1819
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,829
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1820
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,519
Magic.

1821
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,720
Damn it!

1822
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,633
Get to Lang's, now!

1823
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,992
Well done, honey.

1824
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,639
Let's go!

1825
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,760
Leave me here.

1826
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,036
We can make it.

1827
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,270
You said it yourself.

1828
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,672
I've hurt people.

1829
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,513
But you haven't.

1830
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,239
Go. Please!

1831
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,675
We can make it, Ava.

1832
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,600
Bill...

1833
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,839
I'm not leaving you.

1834
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,074
Oh, hey, guys.

1835
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,352
Are my two years up already?

1836
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,038
What's it like out there?

1837
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,272
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

1838
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,511
Are food trucks still a thing?

1839
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,480
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1840
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,838
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

1841
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,280
Where?

1842
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,031
Huh?

1843
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,713
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1844
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:43,031
Like, in general...

1845
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,032
The next time
you do something bad,

1846
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,560
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

1847
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,632
You'll be watching...

1848
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,230
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1849
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,633
Why would I do that?

1850
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,276
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1851
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:58,096
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1852
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,032
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1853
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,536
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

1854
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,840
Of course,
that would be strange.

1855
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,718
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

1856
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,336
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1857
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,511
I mean, because I'm free...

1858
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,000
Yeah. Come on.

1859
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,351
You ready?

1860
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,520
Yeah!

1861
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,198
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1862
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,595
Oh!

1863
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,750
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1864
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
X-Con Security.

1865
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,960
Mr. Karapetyan?

1866
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,760
Yeah, you saw that?

1867
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,714
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1868
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,394
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1869
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,200
Yeah!

1870
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,280
That's how you close a deal!

1871
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,119
This is awesome.

1872
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,240
So, Cassie...

1873
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,993
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1874
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,232
I wanna help people...

1875
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,556
like my dad.

1876
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,560
Really?

1877
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,559
I wanted to be his partner.

1878
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,319
But he said he wants you.

1879
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,515
Is that so?

1880
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,554
Daddy!

1881
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,073
Whoa! Hold on.

1882
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,158
Move, get outta here!

1883
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,160
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1884
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,511
Ow.

1885
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,393
Oh, gross!

1886
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,796
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1887
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,915
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

1888
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,157
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1889
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,273
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1890
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,836
Now, I got this.

1891
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,559
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1892
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,315
This is... smaller.

1893
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,997
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1894
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,992
Ah, I think it has flair.

1895
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,438
All right. Control's online.

1896
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,951
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1897
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,958
It should automatically
start absorbing

1898
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,315
quantum healing particles.

1899
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,440
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1900
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,960
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1901
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,072
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

1902
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,320
We won't be able to save you.

1903
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,720
Okay.

1904
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,154
Going subatomic in five...

1905
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,480
four...

1906
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,040
three...

1907
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,480
two...

1908
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,720
one.

1909
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,800
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

1910
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,792
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

1911
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,469
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

1912
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,756
Scott, we read you.

1913
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,519
I just wanna
make sure.

1914
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,156
Okay.

1915
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,074
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1916
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,240
<i>Great.</i>

1917
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,999
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

1918
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,760
<i>five, four, three...</i>

1919
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,640
Hello?

1920
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,717
Ha, ha. Very funny.

1921
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,234
Hank, quit screwing around.

1922
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,756
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

1923
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,600
<i>Hank?</i>

1924
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,276
<i>Hope?</i>

1925
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,880
<i>Janet.</i>

1926
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,120
<i>Guys.</i>

1927
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,919
<i>Guys.</i>

1928
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,000
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

1929
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,275
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

1930
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,720
<i>Guys!</i>
