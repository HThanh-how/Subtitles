1
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>there lived a bamboo cutter.</i>

2
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,501
<i>On the mountain, he would cut bamboo</i>

3
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,379
<i>to make all manner of things.</i>

4
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,969
<i>Sanuki no Miyatsuko was his name.</i>

5
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:42,436
<i>One day, he saw light shining</i>
<i>from a bamboo stalk.</i>

6
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>In wonder, he drew closer.</i>

7
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,830
A bamboo shoot sprouting
before the plums flower?

8
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,672
What's this?

9
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,695
Um...

10
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,908
may I ask who you might be?

11
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,983
What a beautiful princess!

12
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:17,239
Heaven must have sent her
to me as a blessing.

13
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,751
Did you catch something?

14
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,888
What a pretty doll!

15
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,265
No, she's sleeping.

16
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,475
What?

17
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,024
I've been blessed.

18
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,317
Blessed?

19
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,444
By Heaven, in the grove!

20
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,116
It's me Heaven has blessed.

21
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,494
I'm the one who'll raise her.

22
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,206
Raise her?
She's already a beautiful princess.

23
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,209
There'll be more to this than you think.

24
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,418
Right?

25
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,842
Give her here!

26
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,111
Don't just sit there! Bring me a cloth.

27
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,866
How's this?

28
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,165
There, there!

29
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,416
What's going on?

30
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,878
She wants me to raise her.

31
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,300
Get me a nice basket.

32
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:46,972
This is very strange, you know.

33
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,765
What if she's some kind of spirit?

34
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,725
What does she look like?

35
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,727
A baby.

36
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,939
-Right!
-But just now, she was a princess!

37
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:01,903
That was Heaven telling us
who she'll grow into.

38
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:02,946
Really?

39
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,033
So that means we must raise her properly.

40
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,119
Yes! That must be it.

41
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,328
Yes.

42
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,872
I see!

43
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,874
But who'll nurse her?

44
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,585
A wet nurse.

45
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,297
And the lathe turners have a new baby.

46
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,383
-So this is...
-A gift.

47
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,219
What's the matter?

48
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,570
What are you doing?

49
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,242
There, there! You must be hungry.

50
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,660
What?

51
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,039
She's drinking it right down.

52
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,418
I've got milk!

53
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,529
She laughed!

54
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,782
She did!

55
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,535
Suddenly, she feels heavier.

56
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,828
That can't be!

57
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,889
-Now what?
-She's heavier still!

58
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,474
Let me see.

59
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,520
She's growing really fast.

60
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,498
Plum blossoms already!

61
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,343
She just got heavier again!

62
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,845
You see?

63
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,764
Well, I'll be!

64
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,563
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>the Bamboo Cutter and his wife</i>

65
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,566
<i>would raise this miraculous child</i>
<i>as their very own.</i>

66
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,005
No! You can't have those yet.

67
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,181
There's a baby!

68
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,475
Yeah? Where?

69
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,103
Don't push!

70
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,312
There!

71
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
She looked at us!

72
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,753
-Yeah!
-No.

73
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,940
What is it?

74
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,457
-Oh, my!
-Well, I'll be!

75
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,313
Princess!

76
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,986
She's standing!

77
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,782
She's walking!

78
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
Oh, my!

79
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,307
There, there...

80
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,434
She's funny!

81
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,477
She walked.

82
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,895
She was just crawling.

83
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,313
She's growing fast!

84
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,191
Like a bamboo shoot!

85
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,068
That's her! Li'l Bamboo!

86
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,194
Li'l Bamboo!

87
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,320
Li'l Bamboo!

88
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,365
Li'l Bamboo!

89
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,826
She's not Li'l Bamboo! She's Princess!

90
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,830
Li'l Bamboo!

91
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,834
Li'l Bamboo!

92
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,923
Li'l Bamboo!

93
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,806
Princess! Come to me!

94
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,141
Princess! Come to me!

95
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:52,146
Princess! Come to me!

96
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,899
Li'l Bamboo!

97
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:59,153
Princess! Come to me!

98
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,157
Li'l Bamboo!

99
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,952
Li'l Bamboo!

100
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:11,082
Princess! Come to me!

101
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,669
Princess! Come to me!

102
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,880
Princess! Come to me!

103
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,758
Do you want to come?

104
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,280
Bamboo shoots. That's supper.

105
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,742
Supper! Bamboo shoots!

106
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,623
Right! Stand back.

107
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,632
There are lots!

108
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,217
Yeah!

109
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,416
Come here!

110
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,531
You don't mess with a wild boar!

111
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,993
Huh?

112
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,206
You're a strange kid. You just got bigger.

113
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,750
She's weird, Sutemaru.

114
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,212
She's gotten bigger again!

115
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,548
Like a bamboo shoot.

116
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,551
-A bamboo shoot?
-Bamboo shoot! Supper!

117
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,053
Bamboo shoot!

118
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,847
Li'l Bamboo!

119
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,348
Li'l Bamboo!

120
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,522
<i>Round, round, go round</i>

121
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,401
<i>Waterwheel go round</i>

122
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,322
<i>Go round, and call Mr. Sun</i>

123
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,451
<i>Go round, and call Mr. Sun</i>

124
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,497
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

125
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>Grass, trees, flowers</i>

126
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>Bring spring and summer, autumn and winter</i>

127
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,383
<i>Bring spring and summer, autumn and winter</i>

128
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,469
-Birds!
-Bugs!

129
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,471
Beasts!

130
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,599
Grass! Trees! Flowers!

131
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>Bring spring and...</i>

132
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,313
Huh? Do you know this song?

133
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,356
Yes!

134
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,862
<i>Go round, come round, come round</i>

135
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,617
<i>Come round, O distant time</i>

136
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,413
<i>Come round, call back my heart</i>

137
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:24,752
<i>Come round, call back my heart</i>

138
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:30,132
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

139
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:35,263
<i>Grass, trees, flowers</i>

140
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,685
<i>Teach me how to feel</i>

141
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:46,607
<i>If I hear that you pine for me</i>

142
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:52,697
<i>I will return to you</i>

143
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,620
That's a weird song.

144
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,414
She's crying!

145
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,498
Yeah!

146
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,042
What's wrong?

147
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,878
I don't know.

148
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,172
She's weird!

149
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,802
We live over there.

150
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,305
That's your bamboo grove.

151
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,560
Bamboo shoots!

152
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,688
Let's go!

153
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,572
Princess!

154
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,617
Where are you?

155
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,662
Princess!

156
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,177
What's that?

157
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,451
Could this be...?

158
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,287
See you later!

159
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,748
Be careful!

160
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,545
Should we be letting her
play with those boys?

161
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,297
She's fine with them.

162
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,260
It's just that up in the grove, I found...

163
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,138
No. It's nothing.

164
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,444
That's lacquer. You'll get a rash!

165
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,028
Lacquer?

166
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,952
That smells good!

167
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,955
We'll make bowls from them.

168
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,039
From these?

169
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,837
Wow!

170
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,798
That's my dad,
my elder brother, and my mom.

171
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,607
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

172
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,610
Bring us something back!

173
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,737
The Bamboo Cutter's girl.

174
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,865
Li'l Bamboo.

175
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,958
Come on, Li'l Bamboo!

176
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,813
It's so hot!

177
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,065
I'm thirsty.

178
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,624
I'll bet those are good.

179
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,667
Yeah?

180
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,836
Don't!

181
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,556
Come on!

182
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,933
Someone's coming!

183
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,948
Leave it!

184
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,223
This is for the others.

185
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,492
This is good!

186
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,661
This is good!

187
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,990
When these beautiful clothes
came flying out, I realized

188
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,867
what Heaven wants.

189
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,453
What Heaven wants?

190
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:03,627
It wants us to give her a life
that suits these robes.

191
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,754
To make her a noble princess.

192
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,507
A noble princess?

193
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:15,264
With this gold, I'll build her
a fine mansion in the capital.

194
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,188
Take her there?

195
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,148
Yes.

196
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,276
Out here, she'll always be
just a country girl.

197
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:33,323
Living with nobles as a real princess,

198
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,325
she'll be happy.

199
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,787
In any case, that is Heaven's wish.

200
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,290
A noble princess?

201
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,708
Yes.

202
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,128
Anyway, tomorrow, I'll go to the capital.

203
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,657
<i>From the next day on, the Bamboo Cutter</i>

204
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,203
<i>went often to the capital,</i>
<i>with gold in his kimono.</i>

205
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,210
<i>The summer went by,</i>

206
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,921
<i>and the autumn harvest came round.</i>

207
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,803
<i>Blow, O wind, blow, blow</i>

208
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:41,391
<i>Blow hard, O wind</i>

209
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,852
Li'l Bamboo! Take him!

210
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,815
<i>Bring the fruits of the mountains</i>

211
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:54,863
<i>Chestnuts, mushrooms, grapes...</i>

212
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,991
Carry me!

213
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,123
Carry me!

214
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,807
I'll rub it all over you!

215
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,687
A pheasant!

216
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,274
It's heading for you!

217
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,776
Li'l Bamboo! Chase it left!

218
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,027
Okay!

219
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,416
It's coming your way!

220
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,667
Get it!

221
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,343
I'll get you!

222
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,605
Sutemaru!

223
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,398
Sutemaru!

224
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:14,776
Sutemaru!

225
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,575
-Sutemaru!
-Sutemaru!

226
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,624
I got it.

227
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,001
I got it!

228
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,128
Great!

229
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,340
Are you hurt? I'm coming down.

230
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,636
No!

231
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,813
Sutemaru!

232
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,900
The rocks are weak here!

233
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,198
-I'm sorry.
-Get a long vine, will you?

234
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,366
Okay!

235
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,911
You're bleeding.

236
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,205
A little spit'll fix that.

237
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,457
No!

238
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,751
Wait.

239
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,557
There.

240
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,062
Li'l Bamboo...

241
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,982
did you get bigger again?

242
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,567
You think so?

243
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,864
Somehow, I have the feeling
you'll just keep on growing

244
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,410
and go somewhere far away.

245
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,831
Why do you say that?

246
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,377
I'll always be here with you,
forever and ever.

247
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,463
I'll always be one of your gang.

248
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,048
Sutemaru!

249
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,508
How's this?

250
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,176
Good.

251
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,684
-Tie it!
-We have!

252
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,685
Right!

253
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,273
Go on.

254
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,988
Hey, there are mushrooms here!

255
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,073
Look, Sutemaru!

256
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,575
You're right!

257
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,704
Look at them all!
Tomorrow, let's have a stew!

258
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,206
Yeah! We'll cook this bird.

259
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,208
Great! Pheasant stew!

260
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:40,213
Pheasant! Pheasant stew!

261
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,811
Sorry I'm late.

262
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,440
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

263
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,692
And we found mushrooms and grapes!

264
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,947
Where are you going?

265
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,532
The capital.

266
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,742
The capital?

267
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,203
Me, too?

268
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,957
-Now?
-Yes. Leave that basket there.

269
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,670
But I told Sutemaru
we'd all have pheasant stew.

270
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,172
Leave it.

271
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,305
Let's go.

272
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,329
Will we be back in time for stew tomorrow?

273
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,626
<i>But for the Princess and Sutemaru,</i>

274
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,503
<i>that tomorrow never came.</i>

275
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,336
The young miss is awake.

276
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,302
Good morning.

277
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,871
If you please...

278
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,038
Well, well, well!

279
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,668
I trust Your Highest is in
the bestest of spirits this finest

280
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,419
of mornings?

281
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,674
Mom?

282
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,181
Dad? Is that you?

283
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,818
You scared me!

284
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,696
Why are you dressed like that?

285
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
It doesn't suit us, does it?

286
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,824
Now, now!

287
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:41,413
Get yourself a range of chobe,
I mean, a change of robe!

288
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,082
In there.

289
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,717
All those robes are yours, Your Highness.

290
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,516
They smell so nice!

291
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,566
They're beautiful!

292
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,281
Like a rainbow!

293
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,748
I'm glad she likes them.

294
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,124
I told you!

295
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,502
You're going to live here now.

296
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,966
In this mansion?

297
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,092
Yes.

298
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,561
Wow!

299
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,093
Dad, can I swim in there?

300
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,264
You most certainly may not.

301
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,648
A noble princess does not frolic
and dance around in such a manner.

302
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,484
Your Highness,

303
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,236
I've summoned Lady Sagami

304
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:40,657
from the palace to teach you

305
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,743
the ways of a noble princess.

306
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,495
A noble princess?

307
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,580
Palace?

308
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,088
I have never met a child
so much in need of my instruction.

309
00:36:55,714 --> 00:37:00,593
I will undertake to make her

310
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,554
a truly fine lady.

311
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,267
<i>And so with Lady Sagami,</i>

312
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,479
<i>the Princess began to learn</i>
<i>the noble airs and graces of a lady.</i>

313
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,982
Watch carefully.

314
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:19,320
One holds one's back straight,
and stands with a swish.

315
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,282
Swish?

316
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,494
That will do for now.

317
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:31,332
In any event, a noble lady stands
only on rare occasions.

318
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,004
Then how do I move to pick something up?

319
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,756
In that case... thus!

320
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,926
One proceeds on one's knees,
and always gracefully.

321
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,933
Be graceful at all times...

322
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,898
Your Highness!

323
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,405
Beautiful, is it not?

324
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,743
Unroll it like this,
and the story flows out in the pictures.

325
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,540
Yeah! It really flows!

326
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,804
Let us have a short rest.

327
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,517
Your enthusiasm for practicing handwriting

328
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,228
makes me proud.

329
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,821
Your Highness!

330
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,413
Once more, together.

331
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,838
Hey, this is fun!

332
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,339
Your Highness!

333
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,800
Well?

334
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,803
How's the koto practice going?

335
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,471
Sir!

336
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:18,481
I trust you are well, Father.

337
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,983
Well, well, well!

338
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,490
You're so elegant I hardly recognized you.

339
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,825
Whoops!

340
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,328
And how is the koto lesson going?

341
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:36,207
We've only just begun.

342
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,306
Well, well, well!

343
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:03,776
With me, she treats everything
as if it were a game.

344
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,864
But then instantly,
she does everything perfectly.

345
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,782
That makes sense.

346
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,952
She is truly a princess from Heaven.

347
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,789
She is not one to stay forever
out in the mountains.

348
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,131
<i>Thus the Princess seemed devoted</i>
<i>to making a noble lady of herself.</i>

349
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,076
Whoops!

350
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,579
What's going on here?

351
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,582
Will you stop doing all this?

352
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,294
You are now the mother
of a noble princess.

353
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,422
But this makes me feel at home.

354
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,176
It's because of you
that the Princess won't...

355
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,932
Is something the matter?

356
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,560
You're very quiet.

357
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,479
Well, Husband...

358
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,782
Is that true?

359
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,783
Yes.

360
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,621
That's wonderful!
We'll have to hold a banquet!

361
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,831
A banquet?

362
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,208
To mark your coming of age.

363
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,211
This is the happiest of occasions!

364
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,964
So we can invite my friends?

365
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,592
I miss them so much!

366
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,680
That might be nice.

367
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,598
Don't be a fool!

368
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,977
Do you realize how important this is?

369
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,566
We live in a different world
to those bumpkins!

370
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,403
We'll have the naming ceremony
after New Year's.

371
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,742
After your coming-out banquet,
you'll be a true princess!

372
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,244
Dad...

373
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,706
This is wonderful!

374
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,877
I know! I'll ask Inbe no Akita
to be your Name Father.

375
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,506
Is anyone here?

376
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,968
Lady Sagami? Lady Sagami!

377
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,640
What a bore.

378
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:23,601
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

379
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,898
<i>Grass, trees, flowers...</i>

380
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,445
Mom, can I use this piece of the garden?

381
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:37,824
-Sorry?
-To plant things I like.

382
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,743
Why, of course you can.

383
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,995
Do what you like with it.

384
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,164
Thanks, Mom.

385
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,438
No! Never!

386
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,655
You'll never be a fine princess
looking like that.

387
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,491
I'll get sweat in my eyes
if you pluck my eyebrows!

388
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:25,246
A noble princess does not sweat.

389
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,541
-Now...
-And blackened teeth just look weird!

390
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,668
How will I laugh?

391
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,922
A noble princess
does not open her mouth and laugh.

392
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,507
That's stupid!

393
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:41,470
Even a princess must sweat
and laugh out loud sometimes!

394
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,097
Or want to cry.

395
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,016
Or get angry and shout!

396
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,268
No. A noble princess...

397
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,897
Then a noble princess isn't human!

398
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,570
Your Highness!

399
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,281
The poor thing was tied up!

400
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,037
Your Highness!

401
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:12,001
This way, Lord Akita.

402
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,366
Your Highness!

403
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,333
I'm very sorry! She's still very young.

404
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,001
Not at all.

405
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,421
She's an adorable little princess.

406
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:06,013
She has yet to be made up.
I am truly ashamed.

407
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,641
Don't give it a second thought.

408
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,852
To observe her as she really is

409
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:16,357
will help me think of an appropriate name.

410
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,275
I am glad to hear that.

411
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,989
Please bestow a fine name on our Princess.

412
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:28,160
Your Highness, come and greet Lord Akita.

413
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,648
How do you do, sir?

414
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:05,448
Your Highness, let Lord Akita
hear you play on the koto.

415
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,311
Beautiful!

416
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,567
The Shining Princess
of the Supple Bamboo...

417
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,029
The Princess...

418
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,697
Kaguya?

419
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,907
Yes.

420
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,660
A form as graceful as slender bamboo

421
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,039
and a beauty that shines out from her.

422
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:59,460
I give her a name
that means shining light.

423
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,255
I thus suggest Princess Kaguya.

424
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,799
Princess Kaguya!

425
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:10,638
Lord Akita, you have given her
a truly fine name.

426
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,932
Thank you very much.

427
00:48:55,558 --> 00:49:00,146
<i>Following the rites of hair</i>
<i>and trailing skirt,</i>

428
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,315
<i>guests were invited in great numbers</i>

429
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:08,320
<i>to a banquet celebrating</i>
<i>the taking of her name.</i>

430
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,876
Congratulations!

431
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,504
Princess Kaguya certainly is a fine name.

432
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,823
There are so many fine gentlemen here!

433
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:58,412
This is a banquet to celebrate
the taking of my name?

434
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,289
Yes, it is.

435
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:04,210
But all I'm doing is sitting.

436
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,297
I may as well not even be here.

437
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,449
Thank you very much!

438
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:41,288
<i>Princess Kaguya's naming banquet</i>
<i>went on for three days and nights.</i>

439
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,503
To Princess Kaguya having her hair put up!

440
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:51,257
<i>'Tis a fine thing, a fine thing!</i>

441
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,386
<i>A fine thing, a fine thing!</i>

442
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:59,390
<i>A fine thing, a fine thing!</i>

443
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,977
<i>A fine thing, a fine thing!</i>

444
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,146
But isn't this all a bit pretentious?

445
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,400
Your Princess.

446
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,903
Princess Kaguya, or whoever it is

447
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:16,115
enshrined behind that bamboo blind.

448
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:20,661
What's wrong with us seeing her
if she's as beautiful as they say?

449
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,457
No! Anything but that!

450
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:30,004
So we come to celebrate
and we can't even say hello?

451
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,423
That's the custom!

452
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,759
The custom for noble women, not commoners.

453
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,388
-Hey!
-She's not even a real princess.

454
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,764
What?

455
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,683
She is a princess!

456
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,101
Please, one moment!

457
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,980
What did it cost to get her named one?

458
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,400
At least let us see her!

459
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,485
Maybe she's ugly!

460
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,903
What a farce!

461
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,120
Um...

462
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:55,709
would you know what happened to
the people who lived down below?

463
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,046
I wouldn't know.

464
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:04,301
They're on a journey
looking for good trees.

465
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,677
A journey?

466
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,930
They won't be back for ten years.

467
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,765
Ten years?

468
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,810
Use up all the trees
and you kill the mountain.

469
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,815
Leave its power and go away,
and it revives.

470
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:23,445
Give the trees ten years,
and you can work them again.

471
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,864
Charcoal is like that, too.

472
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:31,828
But what if the mountain really is dead?

473
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,831
The leaves were so beautiful...

474
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,755
It's not dead.

475
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,428
Look.

476
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,849
The trees are getting ready for spring.

477
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,270
They are?

478
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,814
Will spring come back here?

479
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,649
It will.

480
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:06,530
Now the trees are waiting
for it to come round again.

481
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,241
But who...

482
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,689
I've seen this before.

483
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,472
<i>From that day on, Princess Kaguya</i>

484
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:42,686
<i>was like a different person,</i>
<i>devoting herself to her studies</i>

485
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,148
<i>in pensive silence.</i>

486
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,526
Your Highness!

487
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,453
Look at all these gifts!

488
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,749
The nobility has accepted you
as one of their own!

489
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,419
This is the proof!

490
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,888
For old times' sake,

491
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,475
I'll weave you a fine bamboo cage

492
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,935
for this meadow bunting.

493
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,689
Thank you, Father.

494
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,948
Thanks be to Heaven!

495
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,285
Thanks be to Heaven!

496
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,497
I'll just leave this here.

497
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,542
Thank you...

498
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,748
<i>As word of this great beauty spread,</i>

499
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:30,252
<i>huge crowds gathered outside the mansion</i>

500
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:34,256
<i>hoping to catch a glimpse</i>
<i>of Princess Kaguya.</i>

501
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,349
Do you serve Princess Kaguya?

502
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,269
Then give her this!

503
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,187
Please!

504
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,856
And this!

505
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,658
There's another crowd
of gentlemen outside.

506
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:08,540
They've given me
all these letters for you.

507
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,794
And I brought you some cherry blossoms

508
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,715
because you can't go out
with that crowd outside.

509
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,384
Thank you!

510
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,210
You summoned me, Prince lshitsukuri?

511
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,675
About that rich upstart's daughter
that you named...

512
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,303
You mean Princess Kaguya?

513
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,222
Keep your voice down!

514
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,307
Did you say, "Princess Kaguya"?

515
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:12,020
Princess Kaguya?
I've heard the gossip about her.

516
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,314
They say she's very beautiful.

517
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,067
You would shout, wouldn't you?

518
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,029
Beautiful she may be,
but she is of humble birth.

519
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:24,199
She is not a woman for any of us.

520
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:29,579
Princess Kaguya is a presumptuous name

521
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,582
for a daughter of the likes of Miyatsuko.

522
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,376
No, Minister.

523
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,922
She is not his true daughter.

524
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,424
She was born from a bamboo stalk.

525
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,842
A bamboo stalk?

526
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,596
How interesting.
So she's a woodland spirit?

527
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:51,101
That is not entirely impossible,
Lord Counselor.

528
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,352
What?

529
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:56,898
The moment I stood before her,

530
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,735
my aged body began to tremble

531
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:04,239
as if a dry fountain
had come back to life.

532
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:09,995
Just the memory of that glimmering beauty

533
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,958
leaves me completely lost for words!

534
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,343
Stand aside!

535
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,604
I will win this race!

536
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,107
I will be first!

537
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,527
That glimmering beauty will be mine!

538
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,030
I will have her!

539
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,073
I go to meet my wife!

540
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,502
Lady Sagami!

541
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,338
What is it?

542
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,423
Look at these!

543
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,427
Five of the land's
highest-born men have come

544
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,763
and in formal dress!

545
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,764
Oh, my!

546
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,641
Thanks be to Heaven!

547
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,269
A minister, two princes...

548
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,440
But how will we choose among them?

549
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:25,153
They're all here together,
awaiting an answer.

550
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,365
I understand. Leave the princess to me.

551
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,076
You go and entertain them.

552
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,410
I will!

553
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,954
Thank you very much!

554
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,958
Thanks be to Heaven!

555
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,462
That banquet was worth
every penny I spent on it!

556
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,716
They are all of the highest rank.

557
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:50,095
You will not go wrong with any of them.

558
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:53,515
So, Your Highness,
choose the one you wish.

559
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,934
Even though I don't know them?

560
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:57,602
Of course.

561
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:03,691
A gentleman makes a proposal,
and you meet on your wedding day.

562
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:08,488
With your choice of these five nobles,

563
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,616
how happy you will be!

564
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,701
Happy?

565
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,790
I have no wish to marry anyone yet.

566
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,417
You can't mean that!

567
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,296
You must marry a suitable gentleman
as soon as possible.

568
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:27,966
That is happiness itself.

569
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,717
Why would you hesitate?

570
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:34,097
With any of those men,
your happiness is assured.

571
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,182
I will not choose any of them!

572
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,351
Please ask them to leave.

573
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,107
Do you wish to hurt your father?

574
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:49,362
He is as glad for you
as he would be for himself.

575
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,795
All has been made ready.
If you would come this way...

576
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:35,074
Now, if you would each speak
in order of precedence.

577
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,121
I am Prince Kuramochi.

578
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,331
Princess...

579
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,584
my feelings toward you are

580
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,296
as I wrote in my letter.

581
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:55,470
If it came to pass
that you became my wife,

582
01:06:55,762 --> 01:07:00,850
my joy would be as if I had found
a jeweled branch from a tree

583
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,228
of Mount Penglai in China,

584
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,439
with silver roots,
gold trunk, and pearls for fruit.

585
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:12,362
To me, you are a treasure
as unattainable as that.

586
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,739
-If you would--
-I am Prince lshitsukuri.

587
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,742
If you consent to be my wife,

588
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:22,080
l will worship you day and night,
my forehead to the ground,

589
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:27,001
as I would the stone begging bowl
of Lord Buddha himself in India.

590
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,588
You would treat her
as a piece of cold stone?

591
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:35,009
To me, you are as a robe of fire-rat fur.

592
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,805
Put in the flames,
all impurities burn away,

593
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,058
but it is not consumed,
and merely glistens

594
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,893
all the brighter.

595
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:47,355
You are as pure as

596
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,692
this rare treasure of China.

597
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:55,029
You compare Princess Kaguya to a rat-skin?

598
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,365
To me, Princess,

599
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:01,703
you are a jewel
that glistens more radiantly

600
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:06,791
than the five-colored stone
that shines from the dragon's neck!

601
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:10,169
No! To me, Princess Kaguya

602
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:15,550
is like the cowrie shell
the swallow warms as a treasure

603
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:20,096
and a charm for safe birth.

604
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,556
A treasure...

605
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:25,852
A cowrie shell is a treasure?
It is laughable!

606
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,397
Well, a dragon's neck stinks!

607
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,482
It's the jewel on the neck!

608
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,384
What a beautiful melody!

609
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,264
I am grateful for these sentiments
toward someone

610
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,393
you have neither met nor seen.

611
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,729
I ask...

612
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,734
that you bring me

613
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,237
these rare treasures of which you speak.

614
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:24,702
Then I will be able
to feel clearly in my heart

615
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,622
how you treasure me.

616
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:33,419
Prince Kuramochi, bring me
the jeweled branch of Penglai.

617
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,423
Prince lshitsukuri,
Lord Buddha's stone bowl.

618
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,549
But that's...

619
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:43,304
Lord Minister of the Right Abe,
bring a robe of fire-rat fur.

620
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,389
What?

621
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:49,435
Grand Counselor Otomo,
the jewel from the dragon's neck.

622
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,189
And Middle Counselor lsonokami,

623
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,359
the swallow's cowrie shell.

624
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,610
Impossible!

625
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,278
No, no, no...

626
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,949
These things may not even exist!

627
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,202
They were only figures of speech!

628
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:07,537
Yes.

629
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:13,459
You have all compared me
to very rare treasures.

630
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:17,630
If I can obtain one of them,

631
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:22,552
l will happily become
that gentleman's treasure.

632
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,098
Gentlemen, I apologize!

633
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,642
She knows nothing of the world.

634
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:34,230
But she must be beautiful.
Her voice, her music...

635
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:37,775
Indeed! That melody was
quite out of this world.

636
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:41,988
But to set us these impossible tasks...

637
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,532
Out of the question!

638
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,535
She is truly an unattainable treasure.

639
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,543
It's terrible!

640
01:10:56,043 --> 01:11:00,047
When the nobles left,
so did everyone else outside!

641
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,050
Just like the tide going out?

642
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,469
Yes.

643
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,429
I thought I should tell you.

644
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,433
Your Highness!

645
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,314
Let's go!

646
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,732
Where?

647
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,901
-Out!
-Out?

648
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,652
To see the cherry blossoms!

649
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,990
Ask Father and Mother to come, too!

650
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,620
There is nothing more I can do.

651
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,663
Yes, but surely...

652
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,083
Next time the Princess will...

653
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,961
There will be no next time.

654
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,382
I will take my leave of you.

655
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,635
But...

656
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,726
The carriage the Princess
requested awaits, Squire.

657
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,145
Tell them to go without me!

658
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:55,621
Oh, my!

659
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,048
It's beautiful!

660
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,012
Stop!

661
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,268
Your Highness?

662
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,999
How wonderful!

663
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,255
I'm very sorry, Milady.

664
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,970
Please forgive us!

665
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,018
Come on.

666
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,411
They're right at their peak.

667
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,997
Yes, they're beautiful.

668
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,213
Let's go home.

669
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,684
Something's happened up ahead.

670
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,686
Someone's coming.

671
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,688
-Sutemaru!
-Run!

672
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,939
Sutemaru?

673
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,451
Sutemaru!

674
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,370
Sutemaru!

675
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:37,676
What's wrong?

676
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,386
They'll catch us!

677
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:42,598
We're going!

678
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,570
Li'l Bamboo!

679
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,965
Sutemaru!

680
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,219
Sutemaru!

681
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,763
Sutemaru!

682
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,975
Sutemaru!

683
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:31,647
Come on.

684
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:09,185
<i>Three years went by.</i>

685
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:54,813
Off you go.

686
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,830
Isn't it a lovely day?
Look how the garden has grown.

687
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,041
Yes, but you know...

688
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:19,463
it all looks different
when you see it from here.

689
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,097
Well!

690
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,271
It's like the mountain at home.

691
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,689
You're right.

692
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,817
There's the forest, and the hill...

693
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,486
And there's our house.

694
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,489
And the grass is the bamboo grove.

695
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:48,117
The mugwort looks just like trees.

696
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:52,079
You can almost see the moon
rising behind the mountain.

697
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,624
And we could go over the bridge
and up the hill--

698
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,042
Princess!

699
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,962
Where is Her Highness?

700
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,256
You're here again?

701
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,008
What's wrong with it?

702
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:05,634
You're here all the time!

703
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,678
Anyway, not now.

704
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,430
The Prince!

705
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:13,642
Prince Kuramochi has brought
the jeweled branch of Penglai!

706
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,644
Impossible!

707
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:19,189
It's hard to believe,
but he is true to his word.

708
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,068
You'd think he'd be angry
with a task like that,

709
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:27,865
but he really has brought back
a jeweled branch!

710
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:33,120
Your Highness, go and get ready
for your wedding!

711
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,747
I should hurry!

712
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,208
The two of them will need a bedchamber!

713
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,006
If only Lady Sagami were here!

714
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,217
This can't be right!

715
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,887
A bedchamber...

716
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,475
Princess Kaguya!

717
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,102
Where is Princess Kaguya?

718
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,480
Please wait, Your Highness!

719
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,109
Squire Miyatsuko!

720
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,445
Forgive me.

721
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,031
I was in such a rush to get here

722
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,784
that I didn't change my clothes.

723
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:16,205
Oh, this is wonderful!
Thanks be to Heaven!

724
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,499
Please, this way.

725
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,544
Come in.

726
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,982
Without further ado,
I will show what I promised to bring.

727
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:06,797
It's so beautiful it dazzles the eye!

728
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,427
As you wished,
the jeweled branch of Penglai.

729
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,431
Princess Kaguya, are you in there?

730
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,643
Come near and take a good look.

731
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,145
One moment.

732
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:27,693
First, allow me to ask how you came by it.

733
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,362
Of course!

734
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,341
Three years ago,
I vowed to carry out your wish.

735
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,594
I boarded a ship

736
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:57,681
and we set course for Mount Penglai.

737
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,517
Tossed by angry waves

738
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,562
and starving for lack of food

739
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,232
after all manner
of trials and tribulations.

740
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:09,943
Behold!

741
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:15,657
What is that mountain,
so beautiful yet forbidding?

742
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,327
Amazing!

743
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:22,706
It flows with water of gold,
silver, and lapis lazuli!

744
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,082
Look!

745
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,711
A celestial maiden draws water
with a silver bowl!

746
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,172
Hello!

747
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,425
What is the name of this mountain?

748
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,804
This is Mount Penglai.

749
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:42,392
And my name is Ukanruri.

750
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:48,440
At last, I had made my way
to Mount Penglai!

751
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:54,571
Without a second glance at the maiden,
I climbed the mountain.

752
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,951
Look at those beautiful trees!

753
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:04,790
Silver branches, trunks of gold,
and fruit of pearls!

754
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,584
How beautiful!

755
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,339
Are these not
the very jeweled branches of Penglai

756
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:15,425
Princess Kaguya said she wished for?

757
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:21,515
This is the branch I snapped off then.

758
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,109
Seeing is believing.

759
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,362
Look upon it with your own eyes.

760
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:47,541
-No! You can't do this!
-Get out of my way!

761
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,420
What is the meaning of this?

762
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,548
I most humbly apologize. I'll go and see.

763
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,383
I must get this to her.

764
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:58,927
Move aside!

765
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:02,222
At least read this letter!

766
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,432
What's going on?

767
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:08,312
Pay us our fee
for the jeweled branch we made!

768
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:09,313
What?

769
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,565
Made?

770
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:18,697
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro,
of the Guild of Artisans.

771
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:24,578
Prince Kuramochi had us mount gems

772
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,081
and fashion them into a jeweled branch.

773
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,583
What?

774
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,086
The Prince, however, has not yet paid us.

775
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,463
What?

776
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,465
Oh, dear!

777
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:41,595
And since Princess Kaguya,
one of his concubines,

778
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:46,266
sorry, his wife, is here in this house,

779
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,894
we had no choice,

780
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,856
but to come here and ask her for payment.

781
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,362
I see.

782
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,990
Your Highness, what is the...

783
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,495
Your Highness? Where did he go?

784
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:08,872
Where's the branch?

785
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,250
His Highness has taken his leave.

786
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,502
What?

787
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:25,430
Please reward the artisans very well.

788
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,145
There!

789
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:38,443
<i>Next to call at the mansion</i>
<i>was Abe, Minister of the Right.</i>

790
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,247
Look!

791
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,250
See how it glistens!

792
01:26:55,585 --> 01:27:01,508
The world has never seen
such an expensive engagement gift.

793
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:05,929
But if it should please Princess Kaguya,

794
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:09,057
it is a mere trifle.

795
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:11,852
In that case...

796
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,312
Ah, you're right there?

797
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,148
Put it into a fire.

798
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,107
Huh?

799
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,526
What?

800
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,655
If it is truly the fur of the fire rat,

801
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:28,869
it will not burn,
but merely glisten all the brighter.

802
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,620
Of course!

803
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:34,082
This robe is the genuine article!

804
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,960
Placed in the fire, it will not burn.

805
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:40,839
Or at least, it should not burn.

806
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,218
Unless, of course,
between myself and the Princess,

807
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:49,514
there remains some unwarranted impurity.

808
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,516
Yes, indeed.

809
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,686
All the more reason to test it.

810
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:59,274
Burn away all the impurity of my doubts.

811
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,279
Oh, all right!

812
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,239
What did I tell you?

813
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:48,615
You see?

814
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:07,300
My fortune is burning!

815
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,313
I've lost everything!

816
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,908
Do you realize how much this cost?

817
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:35,287
Look at it, will you?

818
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,123
Burn it, she says!

819
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,377
How infuriating!

820
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,846
I wonder how much the Minister

821
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:56,266
spent on that fake.

822
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:59,519
I assume that is what I am
to those gentlemen.

823
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:05,025
A fake jeweled branch,
or a rat-fur robe that burns.

824
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,988
Both those objects were very expensive.

825
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,907
But don't worry.

826
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:16,911
Grand Counselor Otomo
has indeed put to sea

827
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:21,416
in quest of the gem
hanging from the dragon's neck.

828
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:27,005
They say that in order to marry you,

829
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,341
he has sent his wife away

830
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,677
and completely rebuilt his mansion.

831
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:37,182
A warrior's resolve is a wondrous thing.

832
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,689
All right, Dragon! Have at me!

833
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,029
Careful!

834
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:16,262
The Dragon!

835
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:21,059
Forgive me!

836
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,240
Another one!

837
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,576
Help me!

838
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,080
Calm down! The storm will blow itself out.

839
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,927
<i>About that time, Prince lshitsukuri</i>

840
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,930
<i>was having an audience with the Princess.</i>

841
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:21,828
Well, Your Highness,

842
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:24,873
is this Lord Buddha's stone bowl?

843
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:27,375
Give this to her.

844
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:30,170
What is it exactly?

845
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,297
Give it to her, please.

846
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,300
Yes, but...

847
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:45,602
Your Highness,
this is from Prince lshitsukuri.

848
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,954
Since I first heard your voice
three years ago,

849
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,832
you have been constantly on my mind.

850
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:12,962
Desperately, I searched for
Buddha's stone begging bowl.

851
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:18,218
I crossed meadow and mountain,
visiting every temple in the land.

852
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:23,473
Eventually, weary as could be,
I sat on a rock by the roadside.

853
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:30,563
Suddenly, my eye fell upon
a wildflower, there at my feet.

854
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,903
Ah! My feelings for you
bloomed unknown, I thought,

855
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:39,280
just like that flower.

856
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:44,994
Suddenly, the realization dawned

857
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:48,748
that what I wanted to give you,

858
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:52,377
and you wanted to receive,

859
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:56,881
was not some unattainable treasure,
but that flower.

860
01:33:57,423 --> 01:34:02,136
In other words,
the symbol of my devotion to you.

861
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:04,347
Devotion...

862
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:08,685
Princess Kaguya! You are the one

863
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,188
to whom I would give my heart.

864
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:16,985
Would you accept that lovely flower

865
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,903
and my devotion?

866
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:25,201
I have always loved plants.

867
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:31,207
I am entranced by the nameless flowers
that grow by the roadside.

868
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,419
And I always wish

869
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:38,715
l could live as one of those
flowers in the field.

870
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:50,018
Princess, come with me
to some place that is not this one.

871
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:54,480
Let us leave the capital
and its formalities

872
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:59,819
for a rich green land of flowers,
birds, and leaping fish.

873
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:01,988
Somewhere not here.

874
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:09,287
We will laugh, sing, and sleep
to our hearts' content.

875
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:13,791
Morning to night,
the seasons meeting our needs,

876
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:16,628
let us spin a beautiful tale.

877
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:22,800
Come with me
to somewhere that is not here!

878
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:26,220
A land of green where flowers bloom,

879
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:29,349
birds sing, and fish dance!

880
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,060
Somewhere that is not here!

881
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,530
What?

882
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:49,202
Somewhere that is not here?

883
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:54,123
I would very much like
to be taken there again.

884
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,334
I'm sorry!

885
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:58,211
Forgive me!

886
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:04,926
How many flowers

887
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:10,056
have you plucked and thrown away,

888
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:14,227
leaving them
to shave their heads in despair

889
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,522
and become nuns?

890
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,820
I've found one!

891
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:26,864
Get me down!

892
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:27,865
<i>Remaining now,</i>

893
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:33,329
<i>was Middle Counselor lsonokami,</i>
<i>and the swallow's cowrie shell.</i>

894
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:37,959
Counselor!

895
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,837
Is he all right?

896
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:47,969
He's dead?

897
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,262
Yes.

898
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:53,599
The fall broke the Middle Counselor's hip,
which led to his death.

899
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,668
What's wrong?

900
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:24,672
This garden! It's a fake!

901
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,134
Fake!

902
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,636
Fake!

903
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,388
Fake!

904
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,057
All of it! Fake!

905
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:37,643
And so am I!

906
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:38,686
Stop it.

907
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:50,782
It's my fault everyone's miserable.

908
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:55,036
It's not your fault. It's not.

909
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,498
It is my fault.

910
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,501
Because I'm a fake!

911
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:03,503
Princess!

912
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:07,673
I never dreamed
things would turn out like this!

913
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:08,841
Of course not.

914
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,637
But it's not your fault.

915
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:26,442
<i>Now, in spite of her wishes,</i>

916
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:28,903
<i>there was even more talk of her.</i>

917
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:33,157
<i>The Emperor himself became interested.</i>

918
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:39,330
She has toyed with
five of the greatest nobles.

919
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:41,457
Fascinating.

920
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,127
That must mean

921
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:49,382
this Princess Kaguya wishes to come to me.

922
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:54,846
Send word that she is to come
and serve at court.

923
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:56,472
Yes, Sire.

924
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:01,644
If she comes, I'll give her father,
Sanuki no Miyatsuko,

925
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,771
a court rank!

926
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,940
Yes, Sire.

927
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,276
Thanks be to Heaven!

928
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,695
Your Highness!

929
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,738
Please! No more of this!

930
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:13,698
Your Highness!

931
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,745
Your Highness! Rejoice!

932
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:25,001
His Majesty summons you
to serve him at court!

933
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:29,088
You'll be one of his ladies.

934
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,883
And I'll wear a courtier's cap!

935
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,302
Thanks be to Heaven!

936
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:37,388
You still don't understand how she feels?

937
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,223
It's you who doesn't understand!

938
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:41,809
This is what I've worked for!

939
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,145
A court lady!

940
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:48,107
There is no greater happiness
for a girl in this land!

941
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:53,029
At last, the Princess will be happy!

942
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:54,155
Father...

943
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,742
I'm sorry, but please refuse.

944
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:00,703
I can't be His Majesty's lady now.

945
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:05,291
What? This is for your sake--

946
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,168
Tell him no.

947
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,503
But...

948
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:14,508
no one in this land may disobey
an order from His Majesty!

949
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,511
Now, please! Don't be so contrary!

950
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:23,392
If you wish to accuse me

951
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:26,771
of disobedience to His Majesty,

952
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:31,567
then feel free to kill me.

953
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,194
Princess!

954
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:37,073
If your happiness

955
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,575
depends on a courtier's cap,

956
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,204
then I will go to him.

957
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:49,043
When I see you wearing that cap,
then I will die.

958
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:06,143
What? She refuses?

959
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:08,187
What can this mean?

960
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:13,150
I never dreamed a woman
would ever turn me down.

961
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:19,156
Fascinating.
I wish to meet her all the more.

962
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:25,496
In that case, I'll pay a quiet visit
to the Miyatsuko mansion.

963
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,999
Yes, Sire.

964
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:46,809
This way, please.

965
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,108
She plays wonderfully.

966
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,715
How beautiful!

967
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:34,231
Come with me to the palace.

968
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,275
Why are you doing this?

969
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:40,321
No woman is unhappy when I do this.

970
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,948
I will never be yours!

971
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:47,787
You must be, if I wish it.

972
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,790
Bring the palanquin!

973
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,005
What?

974
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,507
Where are you?

975
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:07,098
Where did you go?

976
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:32,706
I apologize for acting in haste.
Please show yourself.

977
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,167
Please.

978
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:39,755
I will burn the sight of you
into my eyes and leave.

979
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:51,684
How beautiful!

980
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,439
Forgive me.

981
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,404
I will withdraw.

982
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:06,949
But I still believe

983
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:09,910
that your happiness lies in being mine.

984
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:14,498
Beautiful!

985
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:46,113
<i>His Majesty returned to his palace.</i>

986
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:51,285
<i>Now, every night that the moon was out,</i>

987
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,871
<i>the Princess would gaze up at it.</i>

988
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:16,644
What's wrong?

989
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:19,980
Lately, you haven't come to see me.

990
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:26,987
You've left your weaving to sit,
and your garden to grow wild.

991
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,616
You sit every night and gaze at the moon.

992
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:33,202
What's the matter?

993
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,079
Nothing.

994
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:37,957
It's something.

995
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:41,502
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

996
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,588
There's really nothing wrong.

997
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:46,465
That's not true.

998
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:57,059
Can't you tell even me?

999
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:06,819
I don't want to go back to the Moon!

1000
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:08,946
Go back?

1001
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:10,990
To the Moon?

1002
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,494
I've begged them to let me stay!

1003
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,163
Here! In this land!

1004
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:23,043
But they're coming for me
on the 15th night!

1005
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:24,837
Coming for you?

1006
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:29,466
I don't understand.

1007
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,927
Your Highness,

1008
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:36,765
tell me something that makes sense.

1009
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:42,396
You poor thing! This is serious, isn't it?

1010
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:59,830
I was sent down here from the Moon.

1011
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:01,290
The Moon?

1012
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,587
So that's what it was!

1013
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:07,546
Yes.

1014
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:13,469
I only realized that
when His Majesty came.

1015
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:20,517
And now, on the 15th, I must leave you...

1016
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:22,936
and go back.

1017
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:27,483
To the Moon? And leave us?

1018
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,362
What have we done to deserve this?

1019
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:36,325
Everything we've done has been
for your happiness!

1020
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:42,331
That happiness you wished for me
was hard to bear.

1021
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,334
Without realizing it,

1022
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:48,420
l prayed to the Moon to save me.

1023
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:53,676
When His Majesty embraced me,
my heart screamed out:

1024
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,762
"I don't want to be here!"

1025
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:02,726
You deliberately called them
to take you back?

1026
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,605
How could you?

1027
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:09,358
What have you done?

1028
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:12,820
But I don't want to go. Not like this!

1029
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:14,822
Then why not just stay?

1030
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:18,617
Fine! Even if they come to take you,

1031
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,577
l won't let them!

1032
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:21,912
It's too late

1033
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:23,372
for everything!

1034
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:29,795
What have I been doing down here?

1035
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:34,049
Throwing tantrums about
belonging to someone,

1036
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,719
ignoring your wishes,

1037
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:40,931
and fooling myself with
fake meadows and mountains!

1038
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,312
But now that I have to leave,

1039
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,482
I finally remember...

1040
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:57,489
why I came down to this place,

1041
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:02,619
and why, in this strange land,

1042
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:05,664
I'd always known that song.

1043
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:13,964
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

1044
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:16,550
That's right.

1045
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:21,555
I was born to truly live!

1046
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,682
Just like the birds and the beasts.

1047
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,439
I don't want to leave!

1048
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:34,777
Do you think I'd let you go?

1049
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:39,740
From the day I took you
out of that bamboo stalk,

1050
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,827
I've loved you
as if you were my own child!

1051
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:52,169
When I held you, changed you,
set you on your feet,

1052
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:56,548
I was as happy as if I were in Heaven!

1053
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,640
It's not too late!

1054
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:08,018
You're still here!

1055
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,938
Here in my arms!

1056
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:13,816
We'll drive them away!

1057
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:18,237
No matter how many come for you!

1058
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:20,447
Is anyone here?

1059
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:23,992
Prepare to defend the Princess!

1060
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,207
I'm sorry, Father.

1061
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:44,721
What a racket!

1062
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:50,561
Let's sing to keep up our spirits.

1063
01:51:00,237 --> 01:51:04,283
<i>Round, round, go round</i>

1064
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:08,078
<i>Waterwheel go round</i>

1065
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:11,790
<i>Go round, and call Mr. Sun</i>

1066
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:16,128
<i>Go round, and call Mr. Sun</i>

1067
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:20,215
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

1068
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:24,136
<i>Grass, trees, flowers</i>

1069
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:28,307
<i>Bring spring and summer, autumn and winter</i>

1070
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:32,519
<i>Bring spring and summer, autumn and winter</i>

1071
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:40,485
<i>Go round, come round, come round</i>

1072
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:45,908
<i>Come round, O distant time</i>

1073
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:51,705
<i>Come round, call back my heart</i>

1074
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:57,002
<i>Come round, call back my heart</i>

1075
01:51:57,419 --> 01:52:02,507
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

1076
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:07,512
<i>Grass, trees, flowers</i>

1077
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,977
<i>Teach me how to feel</i>

1078
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:22,527
<i>If I hear that you pine for me</i>

1079
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:29,910
<i>I will return to you</i>

1080
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:36,667
There's another verse to that song?

1081
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,461
Long ago,

1082
01:52:39,544 --> 01:52:44,841
someone who'd come back from here
used to sing it on the Moon.

1083
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:51,848
When you put on the robe of the Moon,
you lose all memory of this place.

1084
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,309
All grief and sadness are gone.

1085
01:52:55,894 --> 01:53:01,525
But when she sang that song,
tears would come to her eyes.

1086
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:09,908
And for some reason,
that magic took my heart, too.

1087
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:15,372
And now I understand exactly how she felt.

1088
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:19,918
And why I yearned for here,
and broke the rules,

1089
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:23,630
and maybe why I was sent down here.

1090
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:25,465
Princess!

1091
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:27,592
She wanted

1092
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,594
to come back here.

1093
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:33,849
I'm sure of it!

1094
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:40,439
"If I hear that you pine for me,
I will return to you."

1095
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:45,152
"If you are truly waiting for me,

1096
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:48,864
l will come straight back."

1097
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:53,160
I want to go home! Right now!

1098
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:02,669
Prepare a carriage, please.
Don't tell anyone.

1099
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,637
All these ginger flowers!

1100
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:22,582
It has been a long time.

1101
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:25,710
-Num-nums!
-What? Are you hungry?

1102
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:35,554
Did you hear that singing?

1103
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:38,557
Nope.

1104
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,600
I'll go on ahead.

1105
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:05,167
Sutemaru? Is that you?

1106
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:06,585
Li'l Bamboo?

1107
01:56:07,461 --> 01:56:08,920
Can I call you that?

1108
01:56:14,885 --> 01:56:17,220
We've just gotten back.

1109
01:56:17,596 --> 01:56:21,266
Coming over the pass,
I thought I heard you singing.

1110
01:56:21,349 --> 01:56:23,059
I'm so glad to see you!

1111
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:26,771
Uh, yeah.

1112
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:31,985
But why are you here,
and dressed like that?

1113
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:34,779
All this time, I've wanted to come home.

1114
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:37,032
Home?

1115
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:40,577
-Here?
-Yes.

1116
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:44,915
Didn't you like the capital?

1117
01:56:46,583 --> 01:56:51,922
You had nice clothes,
a mansion, fine food...

1118
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:56,468
I was always thinking about
how we all used to play here.

1119
01:56:56,801 --> 01:56:59,596
They'll all be here soon.

1120
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,723
With you, Sutemaru...

1121
01:57:05,977 --> 01:57:10,732
With you, Sutemaru,
I might have been happy.

1122
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:13,485
With me?

1123
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:16,112
I realize that now.

1124
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:19,115
Yeah, right!

1125
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:23,119
You couldn't live like we do.

1126
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:26,790
I definitely could!
I did when we were kids.

1127
01:57:37,175 --> 01:57:38,343
In these clothes?

1128
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:41,346
Half-starving, eating roots?

1129
01:57:43,223 --> 01:57:45,934
Sometimes having to steal?

1130
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,185
I saw that!

1131
01:57:49,396 --> 01:57:51,856
I got you beaten up.

1132
01:57:52,232 --> 01:57:53,650
That was nothing.

1133
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:58,154
You're right! As long as you can
answer back by being alive.

1134
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,660
I'm sure I would have been happy.

1135
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:09,749
Li'l Bamboo!

1136
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:13,044
But it won't happen.

1137
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,338
It's too late.

1138
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:16,965
Too late?

1139
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:21,094
The Emperor?

1140
01:58:21,469 --> 01:58:24,347
No! No one will own me!

1141
01:58:24,681 --> 01:58:26,474
-Well, then...
-It won't happen.

1142
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:28,310
Why not? We could start now.

1143
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,731
Let's run away. Right now!

1144
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:35,275
I'll carry you on my back.

1145
01:58:35,567 --> 01:58:38,445
We'll go far away, where no one knows us.

1146
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:41,823
I can't run away now.

1147
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:43,825
Yes, you can!

1148
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:46,536
If they find us, I'll protect you!

1149
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,204
They've already found me.

1150
01:58:48,913 --> 01:58:50,165
What do you mean?

1151
01:58:51,374 --> 01:58:52,459
I've been found.

1152
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:56,463
So you've been found.

1153
01:58:57,505 --> 01:58:58,465
So what?

1154
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:01,468
Who cares? I want us to run away!

1155
01:59:05,847 --> 01:59:06,848
Come on!

1156
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:09,601
Sutemaru!

1157
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,103
Right!

1158
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:18,193
I'll run, too! As fast as I can!

1159
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:41,174
Li'l Bamboo!

1160
01:59:41,716 --> 01:59:44,386
-Li'l Bamboo!
-Sutemaru!

1161
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:14,582
O heaven and earth! Take me in!

1162
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:45,715
Please! Let me stay a little longer!

1163
02:01:46,758 --> 02:01:51,596
Just a little longer, to feel
the joy of living in this place!

1164
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:54,599
What do you mean? I'm holding you!

1165
02:01:54,682 --> 02:01:57,727
Hold me tighter! Don't let me go!

1166
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:02,899
Li'l Bamboo!

1167
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:05,610
Li'l Bamboo!

1168
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:24,671
Li'l Bamboo!

1169
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,507
Li'l Bamboo!

1170
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:31,177
A dream?

1171
02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:36,891
I dreamed that?

1172
02:02:39,853 --> 02:02:41,271
Daddy!

1173
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:43,857
Daddy!

1174
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:00,582
Daddy!

1175
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:21,895
<i>Now, at last, 15th August came round.</i>

1176
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:09,651
Loose arrows!

1177
02:04:44,185 --> 02:04:45,061
Princess!

1178
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:46,562
Princess!

1179
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:49,649
Princess!

1180
02:04:50,274 --> 02:04:52,485
Princess!

1181
02:04:53,152 --> 02:04:54,112
Princess!

1182
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:25,518
Princess...

1183
02:06:28,873 --> 02:06:32,543
<i>Round, round, go round</i>

1184
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:36,506
<i>Waterwheel go round</i>

1185
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:40,301
<i>Go round, and call Mr. Sun</i>

1186
02:06:40,593 --> 02:06:44,472
<i>Birds, bugs, beasts</i>

1187
02:06:44,555 --> 02:06:48,226
<i>Grass, trees, flowers</i>

1188
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:52,438
<i>Flower, bear fruit, and die</i>

1189
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:54,440
<i>Be born, grow up, and die</i>

1190
02:06:54,524 --> 02:06:55,733
Princess.

1191
02:06:57,276 --> 02:06:58,152
Princess.

1192
02:06:59,862 --> 02:07:00,947
Princess!

1193
02:07:02,115 --> 02:07:03,116
Princess.

1194
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:07,036
-Princess!
-Princess.

1195
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:11,290
-Princess!
-Princess.

1196
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:14,669
Princess!

1197
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:20,550
<i>Lifetimes come and go in turn</i>

1198
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:26,055
Princess! Don't go!

1199
02:07:27,515 --> 02:07:28,516
Wait!

1200
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:30,560
Please, wait.

1201
02:07:32,019 --> 02:07:33,813
Once I don this robe,

1202
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:37,775
l will forget everything about this place.

1203
02:07:38,401 --> 02:07:40,236
Give me a little more time.

1204
02:07:43,364 --> 02:07:44,574
-Princess!
-Princess!

1205
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,247
Mom! Dad!

1206
02:07:53,499 --> 02:07:54,375
Princess!

1207
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:56,961
Take us with you!

1208
02:07:58,379 --> 02:08:00,965
Dad, Mom... please forgive me!

1209
02:08:02,175 --> 02:08:04,093
Come along.

1210
02:08:04,385 --> 02:08:07,471
In the purity of the City of the Moon,

1211
02:08:07,555 --> 02:08:12,393
leave behind
this world's sorrow and uncleanness.

1212
02:08:12,476 --> 02:08:13,728
It's not unclean!

1213
02:08:16,939 --> 02:08:18,858
There's joy, there's grief.

1214
02:08:18,941 --> 02:08:22,361
All who live here feel them
in all their different shades!

1215
02:08:22,987 --> 02:08:25,531
There are birds, bugs, beasts,

1216
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:26,824
grass, trees, flowers...

1217
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,784
and feelings.

1218
02:08:32,496 --> 02:08:33,456
Princess!

1219
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:34,749
Princess!

1220
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:46,844
Princess!

1221
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,846
Princess!

1222
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:11,619
-Princess!
-Princess!

1223
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,876
-Princess!
-Princess!

1224
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:44,318
Forgive me!
