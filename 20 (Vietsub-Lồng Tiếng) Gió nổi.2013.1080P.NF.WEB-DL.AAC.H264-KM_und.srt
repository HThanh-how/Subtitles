Here it is.

8
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,687
May I borrow it?

9
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,773
-It's in English.
-I have a dictionary.

10
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,192
-Very good. Give it a go.
-Thank you.

11
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,422
-Knock it off.
-Butt out!

12
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,757
Better get going.

13
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,259
-Jiro...
-You little...

14
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,845
-No more bullying, okay?
-What?

15
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,388
What did you say?

16
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,473
Come here!

17
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,239
You look quite the hero.

18
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,617
I slipped and fell.

19
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,120
-Fighting is never justified.
-I know.

20
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,373
Go have your snack.

21
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,209
Thank you.

22
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,713
Big brother, you're back!

23
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,549
-I was waiting for you.
-Big brother!

24
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,885
Let's pick bamboo grass.

25
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,639
Big brother!

26
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,268
I want to pick bamboo grass.

27
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,901
You promised to go with me.

28
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,860
I've got homework.

29
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,369
That's not homework.

30
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,620
It's an English magazine.

31
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,625
What a stupid moustache.

32
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,628
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

33
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,633
His name is Caproni. It says he's a count.

34
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,761
-Your face is scratched.
-Leave it alone.

35
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,223
I better put some iodine on it.

36
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,058
Would you be quiet?

37
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,280
Big brother, what are you doing?

38
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,115
You're not allowed up here.

39
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,700
You're not wearing glasses.

40
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:35,079
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

41
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,667
-Mother will scold you.
-A shooting star!

42
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,753
There's another one.

43
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,216
They're pretty. See? Like that.

44
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,928
There's so many of them.

45
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,757
Hey! Who are you?

46
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,884
I'm a Japanese boy.

47
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,011
A Japanese boy?

48
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,472
Why are you here?

49
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,184
I think this is my dream.

50
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,730
A dream? Wait right there!

51
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,620
This is my dream, you know.

52
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,205
It's mine too.

53
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,082
Your dream?

54
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,461
Listen, Japanese boy.
You think we are sharing this dream?

55
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,213
It's strange.

56
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,342
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

57
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,973
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

58
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,267
Welcome to my kingdom.

59
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,476
I'm honored.

60
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,521
Look at them.

61
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,905
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

62
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,290
But the war will soon be over.

63
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,092
Climb up, Japanese boy.

64
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,724
This is my dream.
When the war is over, I will build this.

65
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,686
Magnificent, isn't she?

66
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,230
Let's fly.

67
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,612
Instead of bombs, she'll carry passengers.

68
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,790
Of course we can't climb up here...

69
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,543
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

70
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,763
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

71
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,102
Take a look.

72
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,308
-She's beautiful, no?
-Yes, incredible.

73
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,358
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

74
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,612
Mr. Caproni? I have a question.

75
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,117
Do you think I could design airplanes?

76
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,622
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

77
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,751
Listen, Japanese boy.

78
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,796
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

79
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,800
To fly airplanes is simple.

80
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,638
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

81
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,056
Yes!

82
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,809
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

83
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,938
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

84
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,024
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

85
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,944
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

86
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,446
Yes!

87
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>Arrivederci</i>. We'll meet again.

88
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,883
Jiro, you should go to bed.

89
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,638
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

90
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,142
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

91
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,145
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

92
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,065
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

93
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,526
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

94
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,058
You, there. Come, take my seat.

95
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
Pardon me.

96
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,519
Please.

98
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,765
The wind feels wonderful.

99
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,768
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

100
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,769
Don't worry, Kinu.

101
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,946
-Watch out!
-Miss!

102
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,534
Are you all right?

103
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,201
Safe!

104
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,328
Nice play.

105
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,831
Thank you.

106
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,791
"The wind is rising."

107
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,004

109
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,282

110
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,661
"The wind is rising. We must try to live."

TEA HOUSE
YAMASAN MARKET

112
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,966
Earthquake.

113
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,186
The boiler's going to blow!

114
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,365
-What's wrong?
-Her leg.

115
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,616
Show me.

116
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,078
It hurts.

117
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,788
Kinu, be brave.

118
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,166
It's broken. She can't walk like this.

119
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,794
Miss, the boiler. Please save yourself.

120
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,296
That's nonsense.

121
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,966
Nothing's going to explode.

122
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
My suitcase.

123
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,228
Now, try to relax.

124
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,236
She can't walk. Where do you live?

125
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,405
-In Ueno.
-I'll get you there.

126
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,087
-Fire.
-Let's go.

127
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,230
-What about your luggage?
-It's not important.

128
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,630
-I'm so sorry!
-Sorry, did that hurt?

129
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,923
Hang on!

130
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,476
We'd better hurry.

131
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,648
One of my shirts. It's brand new.

132
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,233
You must be thirsty.

133
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
The well's almost dry. What about you?

134
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,533
Thank you.

135
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,791
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

136
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,294
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

137
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,296
I'll bring someone from home.

138
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,632
I'll go with you.

139
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,551
-Look after this, Kinu.
-I will.

140
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,012
We'll be back soon. Don't worry.

141
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,223
-Yes.
-Watch my suitcase.

142
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,182
I will!

143
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,765
-Thank you.
-I'll leave her to you.

144
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,517
But what's your name?

145
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,941
That was some guy. Don't you think, Kinu?

146
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,837
Jiro! You picked a great day to come back.

147
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,464
How bad is it, Honjo?

148
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,008
The whole east side is burning.

149
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,429
That's everything we could carry.

150
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,889
Got a smoke?

151
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:38,774
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

152
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,442
Tokyo's finished.

153
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,997
NINE-WING FLYING BOAT CAPRONI

154
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,752
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

155
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,565
Stop the camera!

156
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,367
The wind's shifting. It's coming this way.

157
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,124
Is the wind still rising, Japanese boy?

158
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,419
Yes, it's a gale.

159
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
Then you must live.

160
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,256
"The wind is rising.

161
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,884
We must try to live."

162
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,237
Hey Jiro. Ready?

163
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,992
All the new buildings are old-fashioned.

164
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,578
The streets are wider.

165
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,622
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

166
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,124
RESTAURANT SUGIYA

167
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,334
Welcome!

168
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,174
Mackerel again?

169
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,592
It's great.

170
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,720
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

171
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,555
Can I get an egg?

172
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,976
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

173
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,561
Try the pork sometime.

174
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,439
We're more than ten years behind.

175
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,067
What?

176
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,485
Beautiful, isn't it?

177
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,488
Look at that wonderful curve.

178
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,533
You eat mackerel to look at the bones?

179
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,450
Kimi!

180
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,328
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

181
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,759
Jiro sure is working hard.

182
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,303
Fish bones.

183
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,097
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

184
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,015
Jiro!

185
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,642
Honjo, listen to this.

186
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,022
The NACA has a standard curve
just like this bone.

187
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,024
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

188
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,026
Jiro, package for you.

189
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,031
-Yes?
-A lady brought this for you, sir.

190
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,533
You were out, so she left it with me.

191
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,827
I see. Thank you.

192
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,332
Present from your sweetheart?

193
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,209
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

194
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,423
MR. HORIKOSHI

195
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,436
-Jiro!
-Let him go.

196
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,713
-Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
-Back from school.

197
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,717
Your guest is waiting. A young lady.

198
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,469
Oh, right.

199
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,438
Honestly, where were you?

200
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,941
Kayo, I'm sorry.

201
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,527
I completely forgot.

202
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,569
Really!

203
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,531
-Where's Mother?
-At Uncle's.

204
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,367
-Is she staying there?
-Just for one night.

205
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,704
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

206
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,209
You're so mean. You never ever come home.

207
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,841
Oh, it's almost sundown already.

208
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:42,387
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

209
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,225
She must really like you.

210
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,561
Come on, it's been two years.

211
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,689
Didn't you try to see her again?

212
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,150
Of course. I went back once.

213
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,081
-The fire stopped at her street.
-I see.

214
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,541
See? There's the dock.

215
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,347
Are you cold?

216
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,185
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

217
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,275
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

218
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,695
Father won't let me live here by myself.

219
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,908
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

220
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,701
-With an airplane company?
-Yes.

221
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,912
Men have it so good.

222
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,457
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

223
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,960
A doctor? I think you might be a good one.

224
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,962
I think so too.

225
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,257
I'll talk to Father next time I'm home.

226
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,468
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

227
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,309
HANAKAWADO

228
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,945
NAGOYA STATION

229
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,743
Jiro!

230
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,747
There you are.

231
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,374
-You made it.
-Finally.

232
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,751
-We're on our way.
-Yes, we are.

233
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,714
KABUTO BEER

234
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,648
They must've been heading for the city.

235
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,191
There were hundreds of them.

236
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,068
There's no work in the countryside.

237
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,114
-Watch out!
-You must be kidding!

238
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,118
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

239
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,746
KAMEHACHI BANK

240
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,040
-Give us our money!
-Open up!

241
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,125
-Are those the customers?
-Looks like it.

242
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,711
There were rumors.

243
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:07,133
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

244
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,775
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

245
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,447
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

246
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,492
I was told to come anytime in April.

247
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,161
-Then you should've come in March!
-Right.

248
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,748
-I've got an assignment for you.
-Okay.

249
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,834
It's the design
for the wing strut fitting.

250
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,460
Okay.

251
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,962
I need it right away.

252
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,255
-We're behind schedule already.
-Got it.

253
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,844
In here.

254
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,808
The data's ready. This way.

255
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,484
Use this desk.

256
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,071
-It's imported, but no one likes it.
-Okay.

257
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,532
-Data here, hat goes there.
-Yes.

258
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,660
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

259
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,664
He's the genius
we've all been hearing about.

260
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,374
Introduce yourself.

261
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,501
Jiro Horikoshi.

262
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,503
-Now get to work.
-Yes.

263
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,268
Jiro, come on.

264
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,146
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

265
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,902
-The assembly plant?
-Yes, I'd like to take a look.

266
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,033
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

267
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,618
Two.

268
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,038
Excuse me. Could we ask a favor?

269
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,749
Look, it's really coming along.

270
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,961
Sorry to bother you on your break.

271
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,881
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

272
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,468
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

273
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,303
I knew it.

274
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,307
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

275
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,726
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

276
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,230
Honjo, get up here and take a look.

277
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,315
I need your opinion.

278
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,866
-What do you think?
-Looks strong enough.

279
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,244
This is no good. It's just like my design.

280
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,871
Then it must be bad.

281
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,498
Foreman, lunch break's over.

282
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,708
Quiet.

283
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,378
Fascinating! Aircraft are fascinating!

284
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,213
Maybe they are, but we're late.

285
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,682
I'm Hattori.

286
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,105
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

287
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,149
Is this his first assignment?

288
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,401
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

289
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,946
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

290
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,700
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

291
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,120
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

292
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,208
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

293
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,961
But we'd have to redesign the wing!

294
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,964
You're right.
I haven't done the calculations yet.

295
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,469
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

296
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,637
It's finished.

297
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,187
That looks like a very clean design to me.

298
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,148
It's perfect.

299
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,568
-Submit your work as soon as you finish!
-Yes.

300
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,282
-I'm heading out.
-Me too.

301
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,160
What about Kurokawa's homework?

302
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,453
Just finishing up.

303
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,542
Oxen!

304
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,753
They haul prototypes to the airfield.

305
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,591
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

306
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,260
But they're wonderful creatures.

307
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,826
Here she comes.

308
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,162
Get ready!

309
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,583
Approaching the mark.

310
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,176
Damn it!

311
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,773
-Did you get it?
-13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

312
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,609
Too slow. We need ten more knots.

313
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,653
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

314
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,197
Hey!

315
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,157
-Kurokawa!
-Yes?

316
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,618
-Representatives from the Army.
-Yes!

317
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,245
-Congratulations.
-An audacious design.

318
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,082
-Another coup for Mitsubishi.
-Your Falcon is quite impressive.

319
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,936
Power dive. She's trying to break 200.

320
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,129
-Parachute's open.
-Go get him!

321
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,274
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

322
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,609
-What about the pilot?
-He's okay.

323
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,735
That's good.

324
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,115
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

325
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,244
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

326
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,708
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

327
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,752
I'll never forget what I saw today.

328
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,256
It's like an endless road
is opening up before my eyes.

329
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,718
There won't be a Falcon Two.

330
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,263
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

331
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,268
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

332
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:24,064
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

333
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,358
No more fighters for now.

334
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,364
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

335
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,319
-Still open?
-Ah, welcome back.

336
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,905
You're later than usual.

337
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,950
-Two slices of the usual.
-Coming up.

338
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,291
There you are.

339
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,627
Isn't anyone looking after them?

340
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:32,174
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

341
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,010
I feel bad closing the place up.

342
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,929
I see. Well, thanks.

343
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,097
Come again.

344
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,482
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

345
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
It's sponge cake. I just bought it.

346
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,708
Go ahead, take it.

347
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,585
Come on!

348
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,350
MEN'S DORM

349
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,019
You here, Jiro?

350
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,983
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

351
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,863
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

352
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,459
What did you expect?

353
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,630
Did you think she was going to smile
and say thank you?

354
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,340
Of course not.

355
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,052
Well, maybe I did.

356
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,849
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

357
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,772
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

358
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,150
Why is Japan so poor?

359
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:18,947
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

360
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,619
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

361
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,748
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

362
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,750
They're sending you too?

363
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,418
They told me today.

364
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,003
Really? That's great news.

365
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,215
Poor countries want airplanes.

366
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,885
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

367
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,306
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

368
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,599
Married?

369
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:50,312
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

370
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,064
Goodbye.

371
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:32,646
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

372
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,731
I don't see any oxen.

373
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,276
The airstrip's next to the plant.

374
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,027
Everything's so big.

375
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,595
It's the G-38. Is this what we're buying?

376
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,723
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

377
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,268
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

378
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,937
America, probably. Not that they could.

379
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,484
Still, it's quite something.

380
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,319
Amazing.

381
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,239
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

382
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,328
Who cares? We need
their all-metal airframe technology.

383
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,168
You're kidding. We can't go inside?

384
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,240
Beautiful.

385
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,871
You're not allowed any further, Japanese!
Stay over there. Go!

386
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,123
Stop it. Take your hands off him.

387
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,126
Is this how Germans treat their guests?

388
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,506
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

389
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:26,343
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

390
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,511
Honjo, let it go.

391
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,890
We have a license to your technology.

392
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,646
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

393
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:42,401
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

394
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,488
I'm sure you're only trying
to do your job...

395
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:51,660
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

396
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,164
Our orders were
not to let you Japanese wander around.

397
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,541
One moment.

398
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,143
That's Dr. Junkers.

399
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,061
What an engineer.

400
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,233
You can go inside. Dr. Junkers has agreed.

401
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,832
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

402
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,751
There's more vibration than I expected.

403
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,754
Our bosses are getting giddy.

404
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,215
Let the officers sit here.

405
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,091
Yes.

406
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,221
Just a moment.

407
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,141
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

408
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,520
Look, a corridor through the wing.

409
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,066
This is amazing.

410
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,070
It's like being inside a power plant.

411
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,741
Who are you? This area is off-limits.

412
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,620
<i>Guten tag</i>. Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

413
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,872
Please show us your work station.

414
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,499
This is the flight engineer's station.

415
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,918
This aircraft is marvelous.

416
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,086
It's our pride.

417
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,464
Japanese, do not go further.

418
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,091
It'll cost you your life.

419
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,301
Of course, my friend.

420
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,596
-This is incredible.
-Yes, it's fantastic.

421
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,974
A triumph of German industrial technology.

422
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,993
OLD DESSAU'S INN

423
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:13,468
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

424
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,097
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

425
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,725
Jiro!

426
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,186
A cigarette.

427
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,313
No. We're out.

428
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,500
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

429
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,004
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

430
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:54,092
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

431
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,677
It's beautiful.

432
00:50:55,761 --> 00:51:00,015
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

433
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,103
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

434
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,733
We can't learn anything from this.

435
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,861
These are just pretty equations.

436
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,490
"This technology belongs to Germany."

437
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,702
Maybe we don't even need their technology.

438
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,538
Wood and canvas could be as good as metal.

439
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,959
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

440
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,257
Let's take a walk.

441
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,552
My brain is boiling.

442
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,981
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

443
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,445
If we close the gap in five years...

444
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,031
he'll be five more years down the road.

445
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,535
We'll always be chasing him.

446
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:06,122
Someday we'll overtake him and move ahead.

447
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,252
I wonder if we can be the tortoise.

448
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,051
What?

449
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,098
Listen to that.

450
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,940
Schubert's "Winter Journey."
It's perfect for us.

451
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,743
-These Japanese...
-Over there!

452
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,707
Go back to Japan!

453
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,758
-What was that about?
-We saw him in the hangar.

454
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,653
<i>Jiro?</i>

455
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,573
I'm done. Go take a bath.

456
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,329
Dead to the world...

457
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,583
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

458
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,631
There's a telegram from headquarters.

459
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,549
-Come in.
-Not necessary.

460
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,595
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

461
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,349
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

462
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,560
-West?
-They want him to see the world.

463
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,979
All by himself?

464
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,965
Mr. Caproni.

465
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,925
Is the wind still rising?

466
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,553
Yes, it is.

467
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:11,266
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

468
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,560
You're retiring?

469
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,646
It's a big jump.

470
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,485
Jump!

471
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,289
Hurry. We're taking off.

472
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,293
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

473
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,628
-Hurry!
-Yes!

474
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,713
Let me through.

475
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,006
Up here!

476
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,850
-Full power!
-Fly! Fly!

477
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,945
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

478
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,948
We're taking a private jaunt...

479
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,452
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

480
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,752
-What do you think?
-It's incredible.

481
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,464
It's like a building out of ancient Rome.

482
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,384
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

483
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,595
but the Air Force likes everything big.

484
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,473
Japan is poor and backward.

485
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,602
We could never build something like this.

486
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,730
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

487
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,485
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

488
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,948
My wife and family.

489
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,953
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

490
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,420
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

491
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,422
Come.

492
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:15,181
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

493
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:29,737
Which would you choose, a world
with pyramids or one without them?

494
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,030
Pyramids?

495
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,994
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

496
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:41,082
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

497
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,041
I know.

498
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,421
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

499
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,507
Which world will you choose?

500
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:53,303
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

501
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,679
Like this one?

502
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,489
Very graceful.

503
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,659
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

504
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:30,089
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

505
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,142
I'm retiring. This is my last design.

506
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,521
Artists are only creative for ten years.

507
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,649
We engineers are no different.

508
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:53,029
Live your decade to the fullest.

509
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,881
Jiro, we need to talk.

510
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,925
-I've got a meeting.
-Cancel it.

511
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,932
NAKAHARA MARKET
CAFE FLYER

512
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,820
-This is a tall order.
-They're always tall.

513
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,989
How long have you been with us, Jiro?

514
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,075
Jiro?

515
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,286
-How long?
-Five years.

516
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,331
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

517
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,960
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

518
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,295
A plum assignment.

519
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,799
Well, Jiro?

520
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,812
What do you think?

521
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,314
Leave it to me.

522
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,982
Good.

523
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,359
I'd like Honjo on the team.

524
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,319
Bad idea.

525
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,573
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

526
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,783
Relax and finish your coffee.

527
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,244
Check, please.

528
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,331
We've got other plans for Honjo.

529
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,466
ORDER FOR A TRIAL PRODUCTION
OF CARRIER-BASED AIRCRAFT

530
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,593
IMPERIAL JAPANESE NAVY
7TH YEAR OF SHOWA

531
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,962
Damn Japanese engines!

532
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,850
And this darned short flight deck.

533
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,315
Fresh uniforms!

534
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,109
Oh, thanks.

535
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,956
Thanks for your help.

536
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,082
Those jerseys suit you.

537
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,111
Close the flight deck!

538
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,207
Stop!

539
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,895
We did it!

540
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,397
She's airborne!

541
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,839
Father!

542
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,222
Bravo! Nice catch.

543
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,354
That was kind of you. Are you all right?

544
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,730
I'm fine. Here you are.

545
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,275
Thank you. It belongs to the hotel.

546
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,402
Well, goodbye.

547
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,168
Father, I'm afraid I was rude to that man.

548
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,379
Don't worry. He's staying at our hotel.

549
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,382
You'll have a chance to say thank you.

550
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,407
Here!

551
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,585
-Okay!
-Okay!

552
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,590
What is it?

553
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,969
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

554
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,847
He seems to be here by himself.

555
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,128
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

556
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,926
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

557
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,264
I asked it to bring you here, to me.

558
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:16,563
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

559
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:21,026
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

560
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,154
I wanted to see you again and thank you.

561
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,573
Oh, now I remember.

562
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,410
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

563
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,204
Jiro Horikoshi.

564
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,686
Are you all right?

565
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,313
I'm fine.

566
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,777
Kinu got married two days
after she dropped off your shirt.

567
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,323
She cried for joy when we found you.

568
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,160
You were our knight in shining armor.

569
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,453
Your knight?

570
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,539
You were like a knight
on a white horse that day.

571
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,375
This umbrella sure does leak.

572
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,377
It's all right.

573
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,129
I've got to tell Kinu.

574
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,632
She just had her second child.

575
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:27,676
It's such a cute baby.

576
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,390
Your painting is all wet.

577
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,935
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

578
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,021
Look, it's clearing up.

579
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,738
The rain stopped here.

580
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,450
Oh, look at that.

581
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,919
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

582
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:04,505
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

583
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,093
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

584
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,099
There's my father.

585
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,601
Father!

586
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,563
-Come, I'll introduce you.
-Okay.

587
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,442
You're soaking wet.

588
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:30,406
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

589
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:31,865
Jiro Horikoshi.

590
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:36,453
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter
has caused you trouble again.

591
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:23,917
May I sit here?

592
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,920
Certainly.

593
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:47,816
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

594
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:53,113
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

595
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,826
You visit Germany, yes? Dessau.

596
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,330
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

597
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,916
You are an engineer.

598
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:08,504
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

599
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:12,090
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

600
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,053
You're exactly right.

601
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,350
-Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
-What kind of trouble?

602
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:27,105
He fights the government. He will blow up.

603
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,566
Mr. Hitler's government?

604
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,320
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

605
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,240
This is a good place.

606
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:40,786
No mosquitoes. Not hot. Good watercress.

607
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,580
A good place to forget bad things.

608
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,416
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

609
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,584
Thank you.

610
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:57,636
It is a nice night.
"<i>Hier ist der Zauberberg</i>."

611
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,721
"The Magic Mountain." By Thomas Mann?

612
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,099
A good place for forgetting.

613
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,769
Make a war in China. Forget it.

614
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,730
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

615
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,484
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

616
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,987
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

617
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,864
Japan will blow up.

618
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,742
Germany will blow up too.

619
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:25,497
-Will Germany go to war again?
-Yes. They must be stopped.

620
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,543
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long.

621
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,588
Nahoko has a fever.

622
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:35,299
I'm afraid
we'll have to cancel our dinner plans.

623
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:39,303
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

624
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,723
I must go. The doctor will be here soon.

625
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,299
"Who has seen the wind?

626
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,594
Neither I nor you.

627
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:49,933
But when the leaves hang trembling
the wind is passing through."

628
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,441
Let the wind carry...

629
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,694
these wings to you.

630
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,231
Jiro?

631
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,649
Nahoko!

632
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,505
Be careful!

633
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:02,584
Nice catch.

634
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,703
Bravo!

635
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,497
Is the young lady feeling better?

636
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,041
Yes, she's much better.

637
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,251
Congratulations.

638
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:30,088
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

639
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,215
I think you're right.

640
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:37,345
At first, this young man was very gloomy.

641
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:39,222
Now he is very happy.

642
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,474
He has fallen in love.

643
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:43,643
That's true.

644
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,689
Summer love is soon forgotten.

645
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:51,234
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

646
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:53,486
Not me.

647
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:58,575
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

648
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,744
Yes, it's Nahoko.

649
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,998
Please give us your permission.

650
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,001
But...

651
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,294
Father!

652
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,006
I would like to accept.

653
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,508
What a beauty.

654
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:22,182
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

655
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,308
Yes?

656
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:27,020
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

657
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:29,981
I contracted it too.

658
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:34,736
I've loved you
since that day you rescued my hat.

659
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,365
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

660
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,743
Please marry me.

661
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,078
I will.

662
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:47,373
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

663
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:50,168
Even if it takes a hundred years.

664
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:52,295
Congratulations.

665
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:56,883
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

666
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,887
This is a good summer.

667
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,538
-Jiro, over here!
-Honjo!

668
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,540
-When did you get back?
-Two days ago.

669
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,416
Hot, isn't it?

670
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:34,963
Come take a look.

671
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,261
She's beautiful.

672
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,304
Good clean lines.

673
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:50,979
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

674
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,023
But we won't know until she flies.

675
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:58,153
She'll fly. I feel the wind rising.

676
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:23,136
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

677
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,889
My plane was just a tin duckling.

678
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:27,724
I have an idea for you.

679
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,393
I haven't tried it yet.

680
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,857
Use flathead screws on the access hatches.

681
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:37,650
They'll reduce drag.

682
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:42,488
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

683
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,538
A spring about this stiff should be fine.

684
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:54,500
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

685
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:55,460
You should use it.

686
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,129
Thanks, but not this time.

687
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,883
I'll keep the plans.

688
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:04,969
After you use it, I'll use it too.

689
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,222
Okay.

690
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,724
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

691
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,810
Jiro! Are you here?

692
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:16,189
-Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.
-Yes.

693
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:17,607
-It's an emergency.
-Yes.

694
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,733
See you.

695
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,443
Visit the house next time.

696
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,195
Jiro, you pedal.

697
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,827
The Special Police are looking for you.

698
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:33,289
The thought crime boys.

699
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,333
Why me?

700
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,710
I told them you were away on business.

701
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,683
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

702
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:54,477
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

703
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:57,355
What's going on? Why are they after me?

704
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:02,986
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

705
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:05,697
Come in.

706
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,823
Here's your stuff.

707
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,702
Sorry for the bother.

708
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,370
Need anything else?

709
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,748
-Just leave it and go.
-Jiro, it's here!

710
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,375
The prototype flange.

711
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,628
TYPE-S EXTRUDED MATERIAL PROTOTYPE

712
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,839
THE SHANGHAI INCIDENT

713
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,345
It looks great.

714
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,681
Wish we'd had it last year.

715
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:32,974
Jiro, what do you think?

716
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,478
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

717
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,107
A full metal duck.

718
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,483
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

719
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:47,405
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

720
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:48,865
All right, back to work.

721
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:03,338
-The coast looks clear.
-Okay, Jiro.

722
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,009
Better lie low for a few days.

723
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,219
We'll smooth things over.

724
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,305
I'll put you up.

725
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:15,016
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

726
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:17,518
Is it something sensitive?

727
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,604
Yes, very sensitive.

728
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,856
The police will be opening your mail.

729
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:23,024
It's from my fiancée.

730
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:26,903
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

731
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:30,573
You're engaged?

732
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,576
-Jiro's human after all.
-Splendid.

733
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:35,912
You think Japan's a modern country?

734
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,163
It's not funny.

735
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:41,042
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

736
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,169
Let them read your love letters.

737
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,756
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

738
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:52,178
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

739
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,305
Just keep your mind on work.

740
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:59,102
I MISS YOU TERRIBLY. I DON'T KNOW WHY
MR. CASTORP IS BEING HUNTED DOWN.

741
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,855
<i>Why are they looking for him?</i>

742
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:19,914
<i>I pray that he managed</i>
<i>to leave Japan safely.</i>

743
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:38,975
Jiro, telephone for you.

744
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:40,935
Coming.

745
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:43,729
-The telephone is over there.
-Thank you.

746
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,402
-Hello?
-<i>Jiro? You have a telegram.</i>

747
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:50,820
What?

748
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:55,408
<i>Your landlord brought it.</i>
<i>It came two days ago.</i>

749
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,201
Please read it.

750
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:58,494
<i>-Are you sure?</i>
-Yes.

751
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,917
"Nahoko...has had a lung...hemorrhage."

752
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,420
"Please come at once. Satomi"

753
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,345
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

754
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,265
I understand. Thank you.

755
01:31:19,473 --> 01:31:20,933
<i>Wait, hold on!</i>

756
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:24,645
What is it?

757
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,816
What's the fastest way to get to Tokyo?

758
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,776
To Tokyo?

759
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,529
I have to be there as soon as possible.

760
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:34,864
Let me see.

761
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:39,660
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

762
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,829
I'll send someone to hold the bus for you.

763
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:42,496
Okay!

764
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,207
Jiya!

765
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,139
MAIN LINE

766
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:32,898
Darling!

767
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,785
I wish I could've come sooner.

768
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,168
You'll catch it.

769
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:53,711
You're beautiful.

770
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:55,963
I love you.

771
01:33:58,632 --> 01:34:00,134
Jiro? Through the garden?

772
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,145
Come in.

773
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,983
Father, Jiro came to see me.

774
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,611
But he has to leave right away.

775
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:23,074
-Next time I'll use the front door.
-Use the garden, it's more fun.

776
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,076
All right, I will.

777
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,703
Take care, darling.

778
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,413
You too.

779
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,083
Goodbye.

780
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:33,459
I'll see you out.

781
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:41,842
The last train? You'd better hurry.

782
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:47,807
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

783
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:51,394
The way to do that
is to focus on your work.

784
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:52,895
Now you'd better go.

785
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:01,862
He's gone.

786
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,949
Are you crying, dear?

787
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:12,331
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

788
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:16,043
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

789
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,295
I want to get better.

790
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,756
I want a life with Jiro.

791
01:35:26,345 --> 01:35:29,640
You're just in time. The board is waiting.

792
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:38,065
So, are you ready?

793
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:40,568
I'll do my best.

794
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,571
Now the Navy. They're the client.

795
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,781
-Those opinions...
-What we're saying...

796
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:48,117
-As the Navy...
-You should be...

797
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,577
...the production of...

798
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:51,579
...what's most important is...

799
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:53,581
...the speed, the power, the finale!

800
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,083
I'll do my best.

801
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,836
-You weren't even listening.
-Right.

802
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,466
So I gave up on that idea.

803
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:09,889
-Everyone's here rather late.
-Jiro's holding a design seminar.

804
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:15,311
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

805
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,647
-Take a look.
-Retractable undercarriage!

806
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,983
We'll need it for 270 knots.

807
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,487
270 knots? That's 500 kilometers an hour!

808
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,239
I thought the Navy requested 220 knots.

809
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,242
We're designing for the future.

810
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,704
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

811
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:38,417
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

812
01:36:39,084 --> 01:36:41,587
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

813
01:36:58,437 --> 01:37:00,564
-All right!
-We can do it!

814
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,274
When do we start?

815
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,317
All right!

816
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,277
But then weight becomes a problem.

817
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:11,742
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

818
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:21,001
I decided to set this idea aside for now.

819
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:24,421
This is delightful. Lucid and logical.

820
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:25,631
Almost had it.

821
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,551
Our engines are underpowered.

822
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:31,387
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

823
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:35,891
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

824
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:39,103
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

825
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,896
like nothing the world's ever seen.

826
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,691
-I have a question!
-Over here!

827
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:45,025
Mr. Hirayama, please.

828
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:49,405
Mr. Hirayama is our production engineer.

829
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:50,990
Thank you.

830
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,869
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

831
01:37:56,704 --> 01:38:01,917
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

832
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:03,669
What's he talking about?

833
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:05,421
A way to cut drag.

834
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:11,385
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

835
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:13,429
-Question!
-I have a question!

836
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,309
I must say, that was interesting.

837
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:19,977
It was inspiring.

838
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,416
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

839
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,293
Thank you.

840
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:52,968
DEAR NAHOKO,

841
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:58,265
IT'S GETTING COLDER AND COLDER BY THE DAY.

842
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:03,312
I HOPE YOU ARE DOING WELL...

843
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:48,357
FUJIMI KOGEN SANATORIUM

844
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:05,749
Phone call, Chief.

845
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,711
-I'll call back.
-I think it's an emergency.

846
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:12,715
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

847
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:14,216
What?

848
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,458
Jiro! Jiro!

849
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:33,086
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

850
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:37,716
I'm here now. Can you walk?

851
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:40,093
Let's go.

852
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,395
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

853
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:51,772
Don't go.

854
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:56,777
We should be together.

855
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:12,459
-What a charming companion.
-My name is Nahoko.

856
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,837
-So you're Nahoko.
-Jiro, is that you?

857
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,172
We've come to you with a request.

858
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,634
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

859
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:22,386
We've got plenty of room...

860
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:27,558
but I can hardly approve
of an unmarried couple living together.

861
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:29,852
We'll get married right away.

862
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:32,646
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

863
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:34,690
Here? Tonight?

864
01:42:34,773 --> 01:42:36,733
It sounds lovely, dear.

865
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,862
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

866
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:44,908
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

867
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,201
Please help us.

868
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:51,874
The bride and I have preparations to make.

869
01:42:52,374 --> 01:42:53,792
Come with me, Nahoko.

870
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:02,426
Don't worry, he's always like that.

871
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:11,184
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

872
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:16,565
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

873
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:20,068
Is that your heart or your ego talking?

874
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:24,197
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

875
01:43:25,657 --> 01:43:26,700
I see.

876
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,953
All right. We'll have a real ceremony!

877
01:43:54,978 --> 01:43:56,146
Here they come.

878
01:43:57,731 --> 01:43:58,649
She's coming!

879
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:18,043
KUROKAWA FAMILY

880
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:23,507
Hear me! This lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved.

881
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:28,637
She's given up everything
in the world for him. What say you?

882
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:32,557
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

883
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:34,893
without a home of his own.

884
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:38,021
If that's...uh, okay with you,
please come in.

885
01:44:38,563 --> 01:44:41,900
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

886
01:45:04,589 --> 01:45:05,757
You look beautiful.

887
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,921
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

888
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:50,093
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

889
01:45:50,552 --> 01:45:52,721
We will never forget our debt to you.

890
01:45:55,557 --> 01:46:00,687
Come now, we're delighted that Jiro
has found such a wonderful partner.

891
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:01,772
Aren't we, dear?

892
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:05,734
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

893
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,210
You must be tired.

894
01:46:23,752 --> 01:46:27,422
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

895
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,883
Better get some rest.

896
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:32,594
Come here.

897
01:46:32,844 --> 01:46:34,012
But your condition...

898
01:46:36,264 --> 01:46:37,140
Come.

899
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,476
Do you always get home this late?

900
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:23,228
Kayo, I completely forgot.

901
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:25,647
You're so insensitive.

902
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:30,110
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

903
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:33,155
Congratulations on your marriage.

904
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:37,159
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

905
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:38,535
Are they still up?

906
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:40,245
They've gone to bed.

907
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,330
-Did you meet Nahoko?
-Yes.

908
01:47:46,459 --> 01:47:51,089
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

909
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:55,343
Her condition
is much worse than you think.

910
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:58,263
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

911
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:04,186
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

912
01:48:05,687 --> 01:48:09,107
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

913
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,151
How can you do this to her?

914
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:18,325
Does she really have to stay here?

915
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:19,242
Yes.

916
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:24,664
Each day is very precious to us now.

917
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:30,128
Get some rest. I'm glad you came to visit.

918
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:46,645
I'm home.

919
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,855
-I was waiting.
-You should sleep.

920
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,490
-Should you be up?
-Kayo came today.

921
01:48:59,532 --> 01:49:01,743
We're already best friends.

922
01:49:02,994 --> 01:49:06,665
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

923
01:49:07,249 --> 01:49:11,211
She said that next time
she'll come as my doctor.

924
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:17,425
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

925
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,427
Look, they're so warm.

926
01:49:20,845 --> 01:49:21,680
Too bright?

927
01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:23,682
It's all right.

928
01:49:26,184 --> 01:49:28,311
I have to finish the design by tomorrow.

929
01:49:28,853 --> 01:49:29,896
For your mackerel bones?

930
01:49:30,772 --> 01:49:31,731
You remembered.

931
01:49:32,857 --> 01:49:35,235
I think it could be a little lighter.

932
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:39,322
Come a little closer.

933
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:50,333
Give me your hand.

934
01:49:53,878 --> 01:49:57,757
I like to look at you while you work.

935
01:49:58,675 --> 01:50:03,263
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

936
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:07,767
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

937
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,686
Really? That's good.

938
01:50:09,894 --> 01:50:11,980
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

939
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:13,273
That's too much.

940
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:16,276
Half a pound is enough for two.

941
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:21,239
I could eat a pound of mackerel by myself.

942
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:29,372
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

943
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,459
-You won't let go?
-No, I won't.

944
01:50:35,211 --> 01:50:38,506
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

945
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:41,051
No. Smoke it here.

946
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:43,511
-It's not good for you.
-I don't care.

947
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:04,616
Hey, Honjo.

948
01:51:05,116 --> 01:51:06,242
Can I take a look?

949
01:51:06,868 --> 01:51:09,412
-Sure. How's your bomber?
-Coming along fine.

950
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:13,750
This is avant garde. You went all the way.

951
01:51:17,253 --> 01:51:19,422
So this is flush riveting.

952
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,008
Feels pretty rough.

953
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:25,261
We're still learning the technique.

954
01:51:25,553 --> 01:51:30,266
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

955
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:36,856
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

956
01:51:39,484 --> 01:51:44,656
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

957
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:46,366
Sure. Why not?

958
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:47,951
A redesign?

959
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:51,955
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

960
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:54,249
And leave the wings alone?

961
01:51:54,332 --> 01:51:57,127
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

962
01:51:58,002 --> 01:52:01,631
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

963
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,510
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

964
01:52:07,762 --> 01:52:11,683
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

965
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,519
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

966
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,701
Who are they going to fight?

967
01:52:29,784 --> 01:52:33,913
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

968
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,165
Japan will blow up.

969
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:38,334
We're not arms merchants.

970
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,295
We just want to build good aircraft.

971
01:52:40,378 --> 01:52:41,379
You're right.

972
01:52:41,463 --> 01:52:43,339
See you. Get some sleep.

973
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:44,966
Sure. You too.

974
01:52:46,676 --> 01:52:48,094
I'm leaving now.

975
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,220
Good night.

976
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:50,722
Good night.

977
01:53:16,414 --> 01:53:17,457
Welcome home.

978
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,960
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

979
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:24,464
Congratulations. You worked so hard.

980
01:53:25,423 --> 01:53:27,800
She's on her way to the field.

981
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:30,845
I'll probably spend a few nights there.

982
01:53:31,888 --> 01:53:33,264
You must be tired.

983
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:37,101
A little.

984
01:53:37,602 --> 01:53:39,521
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

985
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:42,106
Yes, she'll fly.

986
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,652
I couldn't have done it without you.

987
01:53:46,444 --> 01:53:48,321
I love you, Jiro.

988
01:53:49,197 --> 01:53:50,240
Nahoko...

989
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:45,128
I'm off.

990
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:46,462
Good luck.

991
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:14,449
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

992
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:20,038
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

993
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:23,499
-Just be careful not to tire yourself.
-Yes.

994
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:28,087
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

995
01:55:28,838 --> 01:55:30,840
All right. Enjoy yourself.

996
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:33,593
Kayo's coming today. That will be nice.

997
01:55:34,135 --> 01:55:35,970
Yes. I'll be back soon.

998
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,263
Please come in.

999
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,313
Oh, no.

1000
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:36,239
THE KUROKAWAS, KAYO, JIRO

1001
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:39,242
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

1002
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:41,285
TO KAYO, FROM NAHOKO

1003
01:56:45,456 --> 01:56:49,711
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

1004
01:56:49,877 --> 01:56:51,754
No! Let her go.

1005
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:57,719
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

1006
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:02,974
She wants him to remember her as she was.

1007
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:53,816
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

1008
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,735
How's her speed?

1009
01:57:56,277 --> 01:57:59,322
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

1010
01:57:59,864 --> 01:58:01,115
How fast?

1011
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:04,243
-240 knots.
-Two forty!

1012
01:58:39,695 --> 01:58:42,281
-Fantastic!
-What a fighter.

1013
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:43,866
-Hooray!
-Yeah!

1014
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:44,951
Hey, Jiro.

1015
01:58:45,785 --> 01:58:46,744
Jiro!

1016
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:53,459
Congratulations!

1017
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:57,463
She flies like a dream. Thank you.

1018
01:59:02,468 --> 01:59:03,886
Congratulations!

1019
01:59:04,595 --> 01:59:05,847
Congratulations!

1020
02:00:10,494 --> 02:00:13,581
We meet again, Japanese boy.

1021
02:00:15,082 --> 02:00:16,209
Mr. Caproni...

1022
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:23,216
This is where we first met.

1023
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:25,635
Our kingdom of dreams.

1024
02:00:25,927 --> 02:00:27,929
Or the land of the dead.

1025
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:30,806
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

1026
02:00:31,432 --> 02:00:35,061
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the fullest?

1027
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:38,231
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

1028
02:00:38,522 --> 02:00:40,524
That's what it means to lose a war.

1029
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:43,486
There's your Zero fighter.

1030
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:23,985
Beautiful. A masterful design.

1031
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,404
Not a single plane returned.

1032
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:29,031
There was nothing to come back to.

1033
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:32,326
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

1034
02:01:32,743 --> 02:01:34,954
waiting for the sky to swallow them up.

1035
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:38,457
Someone is waiting for you.

1036
02:01:53,764 --> 02:01:54,807
Nahoko...

1037
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,935
She's been waiting here for a long time.

1038
02:01:58,769 --> 02:02:01,022
Darling, you must live.

1039
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:06,402
You must live...

1040
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:30,801
She is gone.

1041
02:02:32,261 --> 02:02:34,430
She was beautiful, like the wind.

1042
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:37,058
Thank you.

1043
02:02:38,559 --> 02:02:39,602
Thank you.

1044
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:43,272
You must live.

1045
02:02:43,814 --> 02:02:47,985
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.

1046
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:06,587
A TRIBUTE TO JIRO HORIKOSHI
AND TATSUO HORI

1047
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:25,619
THE END
