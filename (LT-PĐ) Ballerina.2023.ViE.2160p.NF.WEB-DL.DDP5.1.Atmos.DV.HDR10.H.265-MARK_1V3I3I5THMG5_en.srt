00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,437
Mister.

2
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,315
You should pay before you eat.

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,695
Hey.

4
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,698
Hey, you.

5
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,745
Open the cash register.

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,830
Sorry?

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,293
I said open the fucking cash register.

8
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,591
Hey.

9
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,051
Is this all you have?

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,514
Why so little cash, you motherfucker?

11
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,974
People…

12
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,186
mostly pay with their cards, not cash.

13
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,563
- Just take whatever.
- Hey.

14
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,274
- What's with the safe in the back?
- What?

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,567
The safe back there.

16
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,362
- The safe?
- The safe. That one. What is it?

17
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,114
Huh? What the heck?

18
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,157
I don't know. I work part-time here.

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,158
Pardon me.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,453
Can you ring me up?

21
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,247
Ring…

22
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,959
What the…

23
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,467
- Do you have any change?
- Change…

24
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,511
I'm not so sure.

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,179
Change?

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,514
Change…

27
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,021
- I'll take it from here.
- What?

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,528
Hey.

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,613
What are you doing?

30
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,173
Fuck.

31
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,678
Fuck!

32
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,341
Could you ring this up as well?

34
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,249
Hello?

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,917
<i>Hello?</i>

36
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,671
<i>Hello? Ok-ju?</i>

37
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,131
Hello?

38
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,383
<i>Were you sleeping?</i>

39
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,511
No, I wasn't.

40
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,556
<i>I haven't called in so long.</i>

41
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,683
I know.

42
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,354
It really has been a while.

43
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>Sorry.</i>

44
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,566
<i>I had a lot going on.</i>

45
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,446
<i>And I was busy performing.</i>

46
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,031
I see.

47
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,867
So you had a performance yesterday.

48
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>Ok-ju.</i>

49
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>Are you free right now, by any chance?</i>

50
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,335
Right now?

51
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,089
I guess I am.

52
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,276
NO THRU TRAFFIC
NO EXIT

53
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,966
Been busy?
I haven't seen you in a while.

54
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,095
I know, right?
I should come by more often.

55
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,222
How have you been?

56
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,516
You know, just keeping a low profile.

57
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,435
Are you working again?

58
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,437
No.

59
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,732
I've been just doing stuff here and there.

60
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,484
How come you've lost so much weight?

61
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,737
- Did you go on a diet?
- As if.

62
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,032
Four straws, right? All different colors.

63
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,368
You remember.

64
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,162
Take this.

65
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,039
It's Turkish sausage. Good stuff.

66
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,207
Salty but good.

67
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,086
Come by more often.

68
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,794
Min-hee.

69
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,469
Min-hee, I'm coming in.

70
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,184
{\an8}PLEASE GET REVENGE FOR ME!

71
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,230
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT
I HAD SO MUCH FUN DRINKING WITH YOU

72
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,570
Huh?

73
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,364
We just closed.

74
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,074
Oh, really?

75
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,079
I'll come back some other time, then.

76
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,122
Or…

77
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,958
Can you grab something quickly?

78
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,128
I guess I can just clock out a bit later.

79
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,521
I'd like this one, please.

80
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,314
- The mint chocolate?
- Yes.

81
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,108
One moment, please.

82
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,783
Is it someone's birthday?

83
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,495
Yes.

84
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,706
And who might that be?

85
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,877
I box up the cakes differently
depending on the recipient.

86
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,005
Well, I don't think you need to wrap it.

87
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,174
I'll make it pretty.

88
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,427
We're famous for our packaging.

89
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,305
Is it for your boyfriend?

90
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,766
No.

91
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,185
A family member then?

92
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,895
Or a friend?

93
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,190
It's my birthday.

94
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,983
What? No way.

95
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,195
- Girl, today's your birthday?
- Sorry?

96
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,322
Don't you remember me, Jang Ok-ju?

97
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,742
I'm Choi Min-hee from Yehwa Middle School.
Eighth grade, class seven!

98
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,703
Wow. This is so surreal.

99
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,080
How did we bump into each other
on your birthday?

100
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,165
I know, right?

101
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,793
So how have you been? What do you do?

102
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,128
- Me?
- Yes, you!

103
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,800
I just do, you know…

104
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,968
all sorts of stuff.

105
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,345
What kind of stuff?

106
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,142
I work for an overseas company.

107
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,394
When domestic businesses

108
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,232
visit places abroad,
like the Middle East or Africa,

109
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,026
I protect the VIPs,

110
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,196
work security, stuff like that.

111
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,823
Whoa, that's so cool!

112
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,826
So you're like a bodyguard or an assassin?

113
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,453
No, it's nothing like that.

114
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,626
What about you?

115
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,503
Me?

116
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,296
I do ballet.

117
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,924
I'm a ballerina.

118
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,976

I don't like this. Let's get out.

Come on, don't make me beg.

00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,847
<i>I thought</i>

138
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,099
that one day

139
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,978
I could die while doing this job.

140
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,523
I didn't feel alive.

141
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,193
It felt like I was slowly dying.

142
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,783
But the day I ran into you,

143
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,078
I realized for the first time

144
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,122
how much fun life could be.

145
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,877
It felt like I could finally breathe.

146
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,547
You crazy bitch.

147
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
Huh?

148
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,929
Why would you die?

149
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:48,961

<i>You with your friends or what?</i>

153
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,644
<i>So you have time for your friends,</i>
<i>but not for me?</i>

154
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,732

<i>come to Jamsu Bridge tomorrow.</i>

156
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,655
<i>I open up shop at two in the morning.</i>

159

00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,186
Long time no see.

189
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,939
What a surprise to see you here.

190
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,275
How have you been?

191
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,111
Do I know you?

192
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,488
Are you kidding me?

193
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,907
Aren't you Bo-ram? Park Bo-ram?

194
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,701
You got the wrong person.

195
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:22,458
I'm sorry.
You just look like someone I know,

196
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,293
and I mistook you for her.

197
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,294
I see.

198
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,255
It's okay.

199
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,965
My mistake.

200
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,264
Excuse me.

201
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,893
Can I buy you a drink?

202
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,162
Where are we going?

203
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,373
Weren't we going to your place?

204
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,459
My place?

205
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,171
You already want to meet my parents?

206
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,630
We just met today.

207
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,927
I still live with my parents.

208
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,555
Let's go to a hotel.

209
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,266
I know a killer hotel in Gapyeong.

210
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,143
Not many people know about it.

211
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,978
It's like…

212
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,648
only known to a select few.

213
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,611
How special could it be?

214
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,571
See for yourself.

215
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,032
I think you're gonna love it.

216
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,945
One moment, please.

217
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,202
- Would you like a room?
- Yes.

218
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,081
- Can we get the suite, please?
- Sure thing.

219
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,882
Oh, can you leave your car key here?

220
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,526
To your left.

221
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,298
Isn't this place unique?

222
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,096
Doesn't it look like a Chinese palace?

223
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,813
It's nicer than it looks
from the outside, isn't it?

224
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,319
Normally you can see the woods outside.

225
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,657
In the morning,
the view from here is insane.

226
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,166
But it's too dark to see anything now.

227
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,523
My God, this is awkward.

228
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,986
Do you want a drink?

229
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,378
Fuck!

230
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,148
You fucking bitch.

231
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,161
Fuck!

232
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,554
Damn it.

233
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,338
Fucking hell!

234
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:37,930
Damn it!

235
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:16,969
Sir.

236
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,354
You've gotten quite the manly makeover.

237
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,565
You looked like a chick before.

238
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,420
I heard you bought a Lambo.

239
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,470
How much do those things go for?

240
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,097
Around 300 million won?

241
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,141
I don't know much about cars.

242
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,353
Where did you get the money?

243
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:09,980
Well, you know,

244
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,524
part-time jobs.

245
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,151
Part-time…

246
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,905
So you worked part-time, huh?

247
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,741
Yes.

248
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:30,042
I know we sell drugs and women

249
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,002
and kill people,

250
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,173
but certain traditions and principles
must be upheld.

251
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:41,387
Immutable creeds dating back
to the days of Kim Du-han and Al Capone.

252
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,023
I told you to manage girls.

253
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,610
I don't recall asking you to sell fishies
and make weird porn.

254
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,074
Buddy.

255
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,744
- Yes, sir.
- Goddamn it.

256
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,457
Yeah?

257
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,925
What a disgrace

258
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,636
in front of our starry-eyed hopefuls?

259
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,054
Look how bummed they look.

260
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,349
All crammed into this tiny-ass room.

261
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,354
Sorry about that.

262
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,734
I'll take care of this myself.

263
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,569
By when?

264
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,904
As soon as possible.

265
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,823
For fuck's sake, man.

266
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,326
Buddy.

267
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,038
You think I'm here to check up on you?

268
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,875
No.

269
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,514
You have three days to bring me the girl.

270
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,975
Can you do that?

271
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,490
What do you want to eat?

272
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,542
Cat got your tongue?

273
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,225
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

274
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,813
Two original burger meals, please.

275
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,815
- Sure.
- Thank you.

276
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:58,774
Excuse me.

277
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,651
Yes?

278
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,780
Can I have mine with no onions,
ketchup on the side,

279
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,990
and a cherry soda instead, please?

280
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,827
All right. I'll get that ready for you.

281
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,259
How long were you there?

282
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,348
They call us slaves.

283
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,392
Slaves?

284
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,269
"It'll be over after this."

285
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,520
"You don't want that?"

286
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,273
"Should I leak the video
to your classmates

287
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,400
so the whole nation can get to know you?"

288
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,530
There are probably dozens of girls
being groomed like me.

289
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:51,535
If we're not submissive,
it goes up on the internet.

290
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,579
What goes up on the internet?

291
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,331
What do you think? The videos.

292
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,338
But it's okay.

293
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,177
I knew you would come.

294
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,513
I prayed

295
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,516
for someone to show up.

296
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,144
So that I could carry out my plan.

297
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,022
Your plan?

298
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,774
To kill them all.

299
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,447
Though in my head,
I've already killed them many times.

300
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,845
PHARMACY

301
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,809
Hello.

302
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,353
Open the door, please.

303
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,938
Come this way.

304
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,991
Well, who do we have here?

305
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,912
Man, the news bowled me over.

306
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:22,250
How in the world did this happen
to the great Mr. Choi?

307
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,546
Your face got totally fucked up?

308
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,552
Hella fucked up.

309
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,396
How did this happen?

310
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:47,150
That fucking bitch left
a fine man totally disabled.

311
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,030
But you were so handsome to begin with,

312
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,450
and you have
an impeccable sense of fashion.

313
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,997
I actually think it looks pretty cool.

314
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,502
It was one of our slaves, right?

315
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,881
No. I would've known her
if that were the case.

316
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,135
It was my first time seeing her.

317
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,805
Why don't you just hire
someone from Yanbian?

318
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,473
It's just one girl.

319
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,810
No need to make a fuss over this.

320
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,402
You and I can handle it, Myung-shik.

321
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,156
Must you insist on doing it yourself?

322
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,867
Myung-shik.

323
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,591
She took my face and my Lamborghini.

324
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,263
My face and my Lamborghini.

325
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,016
I hear you.

326
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,063
But I don't know.

327
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,523
It's not like I'm a hitman.

328
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,817
I'm just a pharmacist, you know?

329
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:16,531
How would a small fry like me
brutally murder a person?

330
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,201
I'll give you 100 million won.

331
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,662
You'll give me 100 million?

332
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,498
It won't take long.

333
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,041
Two days, tops.

334
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:35,926
You're talking real murder this time,
none of that BDSM stuff, right?

335
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,846
Yes.

336
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,891
Can I film it?

337
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,853
Why would you film it?

338
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,314
They film this kind of stuff overseas.

339
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,316
There's even a genre called snuff.

340
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,071
Myung-shik.

341
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,245
Does it look like I'm joking?

342
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,375
No.

343
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,739
What happened to your face?

344
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,621
You've spent enough time adrift.
Come back.

345
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,458
I couldn't find anyone as good as you.

346
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,503
I'm not returning to the firm,

347
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,714
and I didn't come here to tell you that.

348
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,721
I need some equipment.

349
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,764
Illegal equipment.

350
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,852
You know my friend Min-hee, right?

351
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,897
The ballerina.

352
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,570
She died.

353
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,449
She killed herself a few days ago.

354
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,577
But it's a bit complicated.

355
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,291
There's something I need to do for her.

356
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,716
Ok-ju.

357
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,386
I don't know what you're trying to do,

358
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,597
but is this really the way to do it?

359
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,350
If she was a victim,
you can call the police.

360
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,684
I have to do this myself.

361
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,729
It's something I have to do.

362
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,235
I need guns.

363
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,279
Help me out, please.

364
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,130
Is it you?

365
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,132
Sorry?

366
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,801
Are you the one looking to buy the goods?

367
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,719
Oh.

368
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:07,929
Yes.

369
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,681
Money.

370
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,598
Oh.

371
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,642
Hold on a second.

372
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:19,107
Folks like us could never even dream
of driving a car like that.

373
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,525
It's awesome, yup.

374
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,278
That must be a Porchay or Porturé.

375
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,697
Is that the latest model?

376
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,170
Follow me.

377
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,325
What do you think? Pretty sick, huh?

378
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,827
Try holding it. Don't be shy.

379
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,871
You have to feel it for yourself.

380
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,040
A bit heavy?

381
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,710
Is this all you have?

382
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,299
This one won't even load.

383
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,928
There's no such thing
as a gun that doesn't load.

384
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,014
Goodness, you just don't know
what you're doing.

385
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,350
Has the oil dried up?

386
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,685
This one's busted.

387
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,522
It's broken.

388
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,232
Damn it.

389
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,984
Pick something else.

390
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,698
Sir.

391
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,284
Don't you have any decent guns?

392
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,912
Who uses revolvers these days?

393
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,998
They say retro is totally in right now.

394
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,294
What's this?

395
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,338
Is it a toy gun?

396
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,007
I don't carry any toy guns.

397
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,593
You don't even know
what you're looking at.

398
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,097
This right here is a very stealthy gun.

399
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,515
Can you see it?

400
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,477
You can't, can you?
Say you get caught in a pickle.

401
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,313
"Damn it." "Any last wishes?"

402
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,691
"One last smoke." "Go on, then."

403
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You pretend to pull out a cigarette.

404
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,402
And bang!

405
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,112
Bang!

406
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,989
You know Sean Connery, right?

407
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,407
He often uses this.

408
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,244
This is no mere toy. It's…

409
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,704
Hide it in here.

410
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,122
Hey.

411
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,375
What do you need it for? Tell us.

412
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,920
- What do I need it for?
- Yeah.

413
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,214
I guess…

414
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,217
To go hunting. Sort of.

415
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:52,886
Hunting?

416
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,434
This baby right here,

417
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,021
it's used to destroy wasp's nests.

418
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,317
Watch. Shoo, move out of the way.

419
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,300
How about that? Awesome, isn't it?

420
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,932
Sir, yes, sir! I love you, sir!

421
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,351
How have you been?

422
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,688
I've been great thanks to you,
Detective Kim.

423
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,315
I'm rolling in money too.

424
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,946
The thing is, we're looking for a car.

425
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,614
No, it's not unregistered.

426
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,161
It's 19U 9322.

427
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,623
A Lamborghini.
Can you repeat that back to me?

428
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,876
That's it. Thank you. And by the way,

429
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,381
you should stop by sometime.
It's well stocked these days.

430
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,097
Oh God, you and your sense of humor!

431
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:24,519
I don't think I can handle you anymore,
Detective Kim.

432
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,731
All right, then. Just let me know.

433
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,114
Why is he washing his car
in the middle of all this?

434
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:39,659
Is he a sociopath or what? Seriously…

435
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,621
What is it?

436
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,252
- What?
- Come over here.

437
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,463
Look down there.

438
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,221
What the heck is that?

439
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,934
What… What is that?

440
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,645
What is it?

441
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,900
Is it like a tracking device or something?

442
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,311
When are you going to do it?

443
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,485
They could kill us first
if we take too long, you know.

444
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,284
We have to bide our time.

445
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:07,163
We failed once,
which means they'll be ready this time.

446
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,918
We can't afford to waste time.

447
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,010
At least teach me how to use a gun, then.

448
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,306
Quit playing and go to sleep.

449
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,023
I'm telling you, we have to hurry.

450
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,908
One second.

451
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,711
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

452
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,589
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

453
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,092
<i>Happy birthday, dear Ok-ju</i>

454
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,387
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

455
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,351
By the way, are you Team Mint Choc?

456
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,855
What's a mint choc?

457
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:58,900
You don't know?

458
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,110
Mint chocolate.

459
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,114
Oh… Of course I know.

460
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,452
But I've never tried it before.

461
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,830
Why did you pick this cake then?

462
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:20,379
You said you needed to clock out,
so I just chose the simplest one.

463
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,882
Come on, why would you do that?

464
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,552
That's disrespectful
to those beautiful cakes.

465
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh.

466
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,973
But this one looked
like the best of the bunch.

467
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,537
Hey!

468
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,457
Are you into mint choc?

469
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,005
What the…

470
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,481
Where did she go?

471
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,153
Hey!

472
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,256
Fuck you!

473
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,777
Did anyone see you?

474
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:08,821
No, sir.

475
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,074
What did you do with the body?

476
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,494
I chopped it up
and buried it in the mountains.

477
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:17,997
Which mountains?

478
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,876
Bugaksan was right behind her house.

479
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,722
I recall telling you to bring her to me,
not to kill her.

480
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,732
Wrap up your business
and hand everything over to Alien.

481
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,779
- What do you--
- I hear there's money in selling fishies.

482
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,197
Plus, there's high demand.

483
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,950
So don't operate independently.

484
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,077
Run the business within our ring.

485
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,917
I'm not hearing an answer.

486
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:07,046
That business is a personal venture
with no connection to our ring,

487
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,966
so I'd like to wrap things up
on my own, sir.

488
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,061
All right, get lost.

489
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,276
And who's that?

490
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,739
You really are a piece of work.

491
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,533
What is this, an orphanage?

492
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,327
I'll handle her, sir.

493
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,371
And how exactly will you do that?

494
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:43,457
- She's young, so--
- You said she saw you kill that girl.

495
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,418
Doesn't that make her a witness?

496
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:47,545
I guess.

497
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,088
"I guess"?

498
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,635
I will do as you wish, sir.

499
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,429
Jesus!

500
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,476
How does a bastard like you
still have your manhood?

501
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,311
Seriously...

502
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,190
I just don't know.

503
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,943
I really don't get it, buddy.

504
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:33,090
Feels nice and cool, doesn't it?

505
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,885
The water pressure's a bit low.
Do you want it cooler?

506
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,345
It's still good, though, right?

507
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,974
Should we shower together?
I worked up a sweat too.

508
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,978
Nice and cool.

509
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,522
I'm seriously disappointed in you.

510
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,986
I gave you special treatment,
unlike the other girls.

511
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,325
I thought we really had something special.

512
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,744
Remember what I told you?

513
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:05,539
I told you it would be over
if you just hung in there a little longer.

514
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,627
But will you look at this mess?

515
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,212
Huh?

516
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,929
Did being a sidekick
for that ass-kicking chick

517
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,014
make you feel like somebody?

518
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,767
Whoa.

519
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,560
What's up with you?

520
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,312
Don't you stare at me.

521
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:32,024
You little brat, how dare you?
The grown-ups are talking right now.

522
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,861
That sneaky bitch really messed her up.

523
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:42,409
Where the fuck is she?
Start talking, you bitch.

524
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,601
Get up. Hands against the wall.

525
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,399
We're gonna start all over again
with you today, okay?

526
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,075
Of course. Our girls are all young.

527
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,952
No.

528
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,871
We only have young girls.

529
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:29,999
I see.

530
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,295
You don't have to worry about that.

531
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,089
We have an agreement
with the local officials.

532
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,799
Yes.

533
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:47,600
We're a members-only operation
unlike massage parlors in Seoul.

534
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:49,643
That's right.

535
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,398
Business hours?

536
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,902
You're welcome seven days a week,
so drop by anytime.

537
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,361
I've got a customer. Bye.

538
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,259
Fuck.

539
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,980
I'm only going to ask once.

540
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,732
Where is that bastard?

541
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,461
These were hard to find in your size.

542
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,841
<i>I'm going to Russia.</i>

543
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,052
I want to learn ballet properly.

544
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:53,142
It's an early present
since I won't be here for your birthday.

545
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,835
Let me ask you something.

546
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,592
I'm looking for a girl
who's about this tall.

547
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,556
If you tell me where she is
without asking any questions…

548
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,021
I'll leave you alone.

549
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,775
Is there anyone who can answer me?

550
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,696
So you're the girl, eh?

551
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,584
Fuck, he told me
he buried her over at Bugaksan.

552
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,794
Choi, that piece of shit.

553
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,469
Looks like you've been through hell.
Come over and sit.

554
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:17,095
I'm glad you came.

555
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,639
Let's talk.

556
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,812
I mean, there's no reason
for us to shed blood here.

557
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:34,112
And it's not like I'm holding a grudge…

558
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,082
Let me ask again.

559
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,710
Can anyone answer my question?

560
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,226
I guess not.

561
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,947
You motherfucking bitch.

562
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,324
Get her!

563
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,348
Now can you answer me?

564
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,855
Where is that bastard?

565
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,817
Go fuck yourself, you bitch!

566
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,779
Okay.

567
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:21,988
All right.

568
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,032
Don't tell me.

569
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,792
Fuck.

570
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,253
What a satanic bitch.

571
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:45,632
Talk about perfect fucking timing!

572
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,717
Good job.

573
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,679
Fuck… Where did you get that gun?

574
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,475
Nice work. You're good.

575
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,646
I'll finish her off for 100 million.

576
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,231
Wire the money pronto.

577
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,900
Where did that fucking bitch go?

578
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,110
Fucking hell.

579
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:10,365
You think you're the only one with a gun?
We have a big-ass gun too!

580
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,292
A hundred million, my ass.
Everyone's dead anyway.

581
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:34,991
Fucking bitch.

582
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:50,757
You've blown things way out of proportion.
Do you even realize that?

583
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,301
There's no reason for you

584
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,054
to take things this far.

585
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,015
You're fucking overreacting right now.

586
01:22:59,099 --> 01:22:59,975
I probably am.

587
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,603
And you probably didn't think
things would blow up like this.

588
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:05,981
You thought we were easy prey.

589
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:10,443
For fuck's sake, who even are you?

590
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:14,948
Why the hell are you even going this far?

591
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,367
Don't you remember me?

592
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,454
I don't know you, you fucking bitch!

593
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,039
It's me.

594
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:25,542
The ballerina.

595
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,721
Hey, hold on.

596
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,223
Just hold on, stop!

597
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:41,558
I'm sorry, okay?

598
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:43,309
I'm really sorry.

599
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,271
I'll spend the rest of my life repenting.

600
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,857
I'll accept any penalty.

601
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,192
I can pay you compensation!

602
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,820
I mean, honestly!

603
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:58,241
It's not like I've done anything
to deserve death!

604
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,002
Hold on.

605
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,421
Let me ask you one thing.

606
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,632
Was she really a ballerina?

607
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,219
I thought she was lying for sure.

608
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,513
I'd never seen such a fat ballerina.

609
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,224
I stripped her naked, you know.

610
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,145
Is this funny to you?

611
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,580
If you just kill me right now…

612
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:52,378
I'll do the same thing
to that bitch in hell over and over.

613
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,089
You got that?

614
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:18,029
Go ahead and try.

615
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,325
I'll hunt you all the way down to hell.

616
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:32,418
Fucking hell!

617
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,993
Isn't this place amazing?

618
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:51,122
I'll bet no one else knows about it.
It's my secret spot.

619
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:55,376
I used to take the train
and come here all the time.

620
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,795
Have you always liked the sea?

621
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,214
Didn't I tell you?

622
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:02,634
I'm coming back as a fish in my next life.

623
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:07,138
I'm only doing ballet right now
because I can't be a fish.

624
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,141
You want to be a fish, of all things?

625
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:12,810
"Of all things"?

626
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:17,607
I believe the Earth belongs to the fish,
not us humans.

627
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,779
Whoa, just look at that.

628
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,156
Ok-ju, look.

629
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,700
Isn't it liberating?
