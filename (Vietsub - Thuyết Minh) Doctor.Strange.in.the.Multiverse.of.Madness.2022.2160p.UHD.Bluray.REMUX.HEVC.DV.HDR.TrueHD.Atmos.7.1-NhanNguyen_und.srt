1
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,857
That's how we kill it.

2
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,155
The book of vishanti!

3
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,178
Defender strange:
We can't let it take your power.

4
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,710
Hold on!

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
Girl: No, no, no!

6
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,547
Defender strange:
It's too strong.

7
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,451
I'm so sorry.

8
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,286
This is the only way.

9
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,499
What're you doing?

10
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
But I can.

11
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,723
But in the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

12
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,850
your sacrifice
is worth more than your...

13
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,187
Excuse me. May I?

14
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
Thanks.

15
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,252
Doctor west.

16
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,687
I lost both my cats...

17
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,234
And my brother.

18
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,869
I, uh...

19
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,669
did it have to happen that way?

20
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,756
Was there any other path?

21
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,682
No, I made the only play we had.

22
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,809
Well, of course you did.

23
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,563
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

24
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,333
- Ah.
- Little too on the nose?

25
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,838
Congratulations.

26
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,133
Mm. There's Charlie.

27
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,510
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

28
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,764
It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...

29
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,136
I wish I'd have been different.

30
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,150
I never stopped caring about us.

31
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,402
But I had to make sacrifices

32
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
I'm sorry.

33
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,913
It was never gonna work out
between us.

34
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,583
Why not?

35
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,585
Because, Stephen,

36
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,046
you have to be the one
holding the knife.

37
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,298
And I always respected you for it,

38
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,175
but I couldn't love you for it.

39
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,807
How long you had that one
in the barrel?

40
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,310
Long time.

41
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
Look, um...

42
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,693
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

43
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
Christine: Mm.

44
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,029
I am.

45
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
I really, really am.

46
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,825
Good.

47
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
Are you?

48
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,249
You deserve it.

49
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,888
Dude!

50
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,603
Doctor strange: Thank you.

51
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,481
Wow!

52
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,321
No, no.

53
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,252
Look out!

54
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,168
You're welcome.

55
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,045
You know it's ancient custom

56
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,749
Whoa.

57
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,376
That's incredible.

58
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,794
Christine: Yeah.

59
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,133
Oh, god!

60
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
Who's this?

61
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,209
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

62
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,568
Hey, kid.

63
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,764
We'll take her back to the sanc...

64
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,870
She took your slingie.

65
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,626
Woman: Yeah, it was crazy, man.

66
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,683
but what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.

67
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,395
That wasn't a dream.

68
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,439
It was another universe.

69
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,932
How much experience do you guys have
with the multiverse?

70
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,883
We have experience of the multiverse.

71
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,032
Most recently, there was
an incident with spider-man.

72
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,408
What man?

73
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,829
- Hence the name.
- Gross.

74
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,291
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

75
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,670
Well, maybe, I don't know.

76
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,880
Honestly, I hope not.

77
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,048
Girl: Super weird.

78
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,134
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

79
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,844
I'm from another universe.

80
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,739
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

81
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,972
I don't.

82
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,578
which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you

83
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,829
to enlighten us.

84
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,751
You're not my favourite.

85
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,636
Look, I left a very nice wedding

86
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,998
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

87
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,210
No, I didn't. Yes.

88
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
You need to explain to me
what's going on.

89
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,714
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

90
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,675
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

91
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,307
What power?

92
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,352
I can travel the multiverse.

93
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
What?

94
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,314
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

95
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
Can't control it.

96
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,196
Only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.

97
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,492
Okay. And did other me know
how to defeat this demon?

98
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,662
of this magical book of pure good

99
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,084
The book of vishanti?

100
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,298
Actually, it does.

101
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,986
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become sorcerer supreme.

102
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,219
Doctor strange: Unbelievable.

103
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,637
You're not the sorcerer supreme?

104
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,284
Other you was sorcerer supreme
of his universe.

105
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,410
Doctor strange: Right. Yeah.

106
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,060
Although it does exist,

107
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,480
the book of vishanti
is said to be unreachable.

108
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,899
It is. Except...

109
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,821
Then the demon caught up with us.

110
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,657
I thought you'd protect me...

111
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,578
But you didn't.

112
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,163
That was the fight in my dream.

113
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
Prove it.

114
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,928
It wasn't a dream.

115
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,436
That means...

116
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,024
Dreams are windows into the lives
of our multiversal selves.

117
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,903
That was his theory.

118
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,495
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

119
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,501
The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.

120
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,762
America Chavez.

121
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
Miss Chavez, will you come
with us to kamar-taj?

122
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,433
You'll be safe there.

123
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,311
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

124
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,439
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

125
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,955
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

126
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,044
The creature that killed him, did...

127
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,797
Did it have the same markings
as the octopus?

128
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,007
Runes.

129
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,301
This isn't sorcery.

130
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
It's witchcraft.

131
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,639
Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?

132
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,275
But we couldn't wait.

133
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,321
Oh!

134
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,249
Oh, okay.

135
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,500
You can tuck me in, mom.

136
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,347
We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.

137
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,684
You can come tuck me in if you want.

138
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
Apples, right?

139
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,309
- Eventually.
- Hmm.

140
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,197
Oh, it's all very real, thanks.

141
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,242
I've put the magic behind me.

142
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,957
wanting to discuss
what happened at westview.

143
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,674
But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.

144
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,987
Then what are you here for?

145
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,308
With what?

146
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,477
What do you know about the multiverse?

147
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,271
Wanda: The multiverse.

148
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,609
He believed it was real,
and dangerous.

149
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,656
We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it,

150
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,283
but she's being pursued.

151
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,336
There are other avengers.

152
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,089
Yeah, but given the choice
between the Archer with the mohawk

153
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,341
and several bug-themed crime fighters,

154
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,848
It's an easy call.

155
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,100
Come to kamar-taj.

156
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,479
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

157
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,694
Here?

158
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,114
Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own,

159
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,369
and I can protect her.

160
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,233
You never told me her name, did you?

161
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,756
- Mm.
- No, I didn't.

162
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,554
You know, the hex was the easy part.

163
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,266
The lying, not so much.

164
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
The darkhold.

165
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,965
I know it's the book of the damned,

166
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,552
and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

167
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,345
I wonder what it's done to you.

168
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,889
The darkhold only showed me the truth.

169
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,685
Everything I lost can be mine again.

170
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,395
What do you want with america?

171
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,899
I'm going to leave this reality

172
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,152
and go to one where I can be
with my children.

173
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,613
Wanda, your children aren't real.

174
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,824
You created them using magic.

175
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,166
there was a universe

176
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
wouldn't you want to go there?

177
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,172
I am happy.

178
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,685
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

179
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,356
She's a supernatural being.

180
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,109
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this

181
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,987
Her sacrifice

182
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,329
Is it the one you used

183
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,415
when you gave Thanos the time stone?

184
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,091
You break the rules and become a hero.

185
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,177
I do it, and I become the enemy.

186
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,096
That doesn't seem fair.

187
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,141
What happens now?

188
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,935
Return to kamar-taj

189
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,229
and prepare to hand over
america Chavez by sundown.

190
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,984
After that...

191
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,744
And if we don't?

192
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,754
It will be the Scarlet witch.

193
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,891
The Scarlet witch.

194
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,229
Wanda's gone.

195
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,565
She's got the darkhold,
and the darkhold has her.

196
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,322
The Scarlet witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.

197
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,701
She can rewrite reality as she chooses,

198
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,663
and is prophesised to either rule

199
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,832
or annihilate the cosmos.

200
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,168
She took over a whole town
using her mind.

201
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,131
If she gets america's power,

202
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,633
she could enslave the entire multiverse.

203
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,346
So, the person you went to ask for help,

204
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,450
is the person that's trying to kill me?

205
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,853
Yeah.

206
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,149
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

207
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,860
Kamar-taj must now become a fortress.

208
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,111
It's an honour to court death
alongside you once again.

209
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,446
The honour is ours.

210
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,032
Whatever the
sorcerer supreme asks of us,

211
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,533
it shall be done.

212
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,702
Sorcerer: Extra duty men,
follow me.

213
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,913
It's ancient custom.

214
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,273
Got it.

215
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,984
No pressure, then.

216
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,292
All this for a child you met yesterday.

217
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,380
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

218
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,433
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen strange.

219
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,322
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

220
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,244
The full might of kamar-taj
stands against you.

221
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,165
Defensive positions, now!

222
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,677
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

223
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,762
Doctor strange: Yeah.

224
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,573
Book of the damned,
calling yourself a witch,

225
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,476
I don't exactly call that
being reasonable.

226
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,103
Sending those creatures
after her instead of myself

227
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,688
was mercy.

228
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,568
And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults,

229
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,201
You have exhausted my Patience,

230
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,790
but I do hope you understand
that even now,

231
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,458
what's about to happen,

232
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,642
Wong: Hold!

233
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,895
Hold!

234
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,250
Reinforce the shield.

235
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,960
Sorcerer 1: Reinforce the shield!

236
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,420
Sorcerer 2: Reinforce the shield!

237
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,025
She's trying to get in their heads.

238
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,403
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

239
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,233
Wong: The shield is down!

240
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,198
Fire!

241
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,928
Fire at will!

242
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,318
Wong!

243
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,611
Get out of here!

244
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,576
Go, go.

245
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,536
Scarlet witch: America...

246
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,213
You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.

247
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,965
Fine.

248
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,871
America: Wong, what happened?

249
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,623
Wong: Kamar-taj has fallen.

250
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,097
Reflections.

251
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,099
She's using the reflections.
Cover them.

252
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,844
just to keep me from my children.

253
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,429
You took those lives.

254
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,473
You cannot be allowed
to cross into the multiverse.

255
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,477
I'm a mother.

256
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,438
Wanda, you have no children.

257
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,690
They don't exist.

258
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,567
Scarlet witch: Oh, but they do.

259
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,861
In every other universe.

260
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,918
Billy: We're gonna show it.

261
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,173
All right, go on back, go on back.

262
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,536
Tommy: All right, yeah. Don't...

263
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,301
Scarlet witch: Of my boys.

264
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,695
Tommy: Billy, don't you dare! No!

265
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,512
Of our life together.

266
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,948
838 Wanda: Here.
Billy and Tommy: Yes!

267
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,515
838 Wanda: And then back to front.

268
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,933
Back to front.

269
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,602
Billy: Can I have some?

270
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,686
Please?

271
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,165
- Are you guys ready?
- Tommy: It's okay.

272
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,475
Scarlet witch: Every night...

273
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,236
The same dream.

274
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,621
The same nightmare.

275
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,629
What happens to the other you?

276
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,132
What happens to their mother?

277
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,532
You okay?

278
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,494
You saved me.

279
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,788
I hope so.

280
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,673
So, this is New York
in the multi...

281
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,969
There it is.

282
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,769
Crap.

283
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,356
Cut it out.

284
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,611
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

285
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,405
We'll get you fixed.

286
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,115
All right, america.

287
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,108
You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.

288
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,245
I don't know how.

289
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,454
You just did it.

290
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,539
Not on purpose.

291
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,583
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

292
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,835
I can't control my powers...

293
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,437
You must be able to control it somehow.

294
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,466
Sorry.

295
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,178
Well, what about this
universe's version of you?

296
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,138
Maybe she could
control her powers.

297
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,140
This universe doesn't have a me.

298
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,017
- What?
- None of them do.

299
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,143
But how do you know that?

300
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,357
And 'cause I never dream.

301
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,138
What about the book of vishanti?

302
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
What about it?

303
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,498
Other you thought it could stop

304
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:36,583
whoever was after me.

305
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,751
Yeah, well, good for other me.
He's not here, is he?

306
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,880
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another other me...

307
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,466
We need to go find...

308
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,628
We go on red?

309
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,380
Rule number one of multiversal travel,

310
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,965
you don't know anything.

311
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,634
Right.

312
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,221
It's red.

313
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,525
America!

314
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,569
Rule number two,

315
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,029
find food.

316
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,156
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

317
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,368
America: It was free.

318
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,787
Food's free
in most universes, actually.

319
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,084
Crap.

320
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,460
Maybe it's not free here.

321
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,587
Pizza poppa always gets paid.

322
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,983
- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself, there,

323
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,133
Doctor strange.

324
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,261
Where'd you get
this cape from, anyway?

325
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,055
Oh, that feels authentic.

326
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,116
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

327
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,519
You took this whole suit
from the strange museum, didn't you?

328
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,479
- Strange museum?
- You're a taker.

329
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,189
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

330
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,075
Come on. It's not permanent.

331
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,911
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

332
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
were we paint in one of them?

333
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,841
Yeah, you don't wanna
get stuck in there.

334
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,551
It's really hard to eat.

335
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,637
How many universes have you been to?

336
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,849
Seventy-two.

337
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,767
Seventy-three, counting this one.

338
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,935
That's...

339
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,732
Replay your significant memories,

340
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,069
We remember so you don't forget.

341
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,327
Christine: This is pretty fancy.

342
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,039
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

343
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,506
So, um, got you a little something.

344
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,679
What is it?

345
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,347
Christine: Open it and see.

346
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,031
Automated voice: Memory Lane.

347
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,866
Replay your significant memories,

348
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,701
now at a discounted price.

349
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,787
We remember so you don't forget.

350
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,337
Doctor strange: Where's this?

351
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,673
Home.

352
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,093
My moms.

353
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,096
Son mis madres.

354
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,724
Gpara mi? Ay, qué Linda.

355
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,726
Gracias.

356
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,729
A ver, te la pongo.

357
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
Mm. Tan hermosa.

358
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,267
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

359
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
Hey, kid.

360
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,314
America: Doesn't matter.

361
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,485
I didn't lose them.
I killed them.

362
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,593
and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe,

363
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,761
- with no way to escape.
- Listen,

364
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,288
if your moms are
anything like their daughter,

365
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,622
they survived.

366
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,797
Not bad.

367
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,508
Thanks.

368
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,970
That woman in your memory bank thing,

369
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,430
that was Christine, right?

370
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,894
- How do you know her?
- From other you.

371
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,687
Were they together?

372
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
He blew it.

373
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,566
Of course.

374
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,485
Did you blow it with your Christine?

375
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,864
Yes, I guess I did.

376
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,451
Complicated.

377
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,095
More complicated
than being chased by a witch

378
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
through the multiverse?

379
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,164
Yes, actually, it is.

380
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,248
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

381
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,291
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

382
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,419
If other you's dead,

383
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,380
who's master of the sanctum?

384
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,346
Oh, shit.

385
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,608
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

386
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,795
He was actually the first guy
who let me into kamar-taj.

387
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,073
and dedicated his life
to trying to kill me.

388
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,034
Great.

389
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,084
You did?

390
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,502
Yes.

391
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,132
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

392
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
My brother.

393
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:55,855
All right.

394
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,317
838 mordo: Come in,

395
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,619
You go on red.

396
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,369
838 mordo: And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.

397
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,252
A multiversal traveller.

398
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,672
Well, thank the stars
you brought doctor strange to safety.

399
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,264
to attack america in other universes.

400
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,891
So she has the darkhold?

401
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,476
Oh, you know of the darkhold?

402
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,270
Oh, yes. We have a darkhold
in this universe, too.

403
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,485
falling into the wrong hands.

404
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,694
Damn right.

405
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,571
But if your darkhold
is anything like ours,

406
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,198
I'm afraid she can do far worse

407
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
What do you mean?

408
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,749
There is a spell contained
within those pages...

409
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,169
Corrosive to the soul,

410
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,298
a desecration of reality itself.

411
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,218
Dreamwalking.

412
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,431
A dreamwalking sorcerer
projects their own consciousness

413
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,063
possessing the body
of an alternate self.

414
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,777
They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger

415
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,238
and pursue their enemies from afar.

416
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,035
The possession is not a permanent link

417
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,623
But in the fleeting time they dreamwalk,

418
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,669
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

419
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,430
It may be the Scarlet witch.

420
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,436
Doctor strange: Because that
was her being reasonable.

421
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,940
The darkhold's antithesis?

422
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,317
It can give a sorcerer

423
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,362
whatever power they need
to vanquish their enemy.

424
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,700
I need your help
to get me to it.

425
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,793
But I hope you,
of all people, understand

426
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,260
It's the two of you.

427
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,512
- Doctor strange: Oh, god.
- What was in that tea?

428
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,103
You son of a bitch.

429
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,866
The sands of nisanti.

430
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,828
I'm only acting as you would.

431
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,708
She's coming.

432
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,662
Billy: Can we have
a little more ice cream?

433
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,045
Tommy: Please.
Billy: Please, please, please!

434
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,070
A little more, please!

435
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,589
838 Wanda: Hey, don't make mom
out to be the bad guy.

436
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,757
Billy: You know who's the best?

437
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,158
Tommy: Who? Billy: 2003 tigers.

438
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,243
Tommy: They suck.

439
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,370
They're so bad they suck egg.

440
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,205
Billy: No, they don't.
They're the best.

441
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,082
Tommy: Doofus. Billy: Doofus 2.

442
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,084
Tommy: Triple infinity doofus.

443
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,462
Billy: Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.

444
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,049
Tommy: Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.

445
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,902
Billy: Googolplex doofus.

446
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,103
Billy: Mom?

447
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,695
Billy: Where are you going?

448
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,868
Just to take out the trash.

449
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,787
Billy: Can we show you something?

450
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,292
Tommy: Mom, hurry, come on!

451
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,793
Billy: Come on, it's important.

452
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,713
Billy: You'll like it.

453
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,424
Tommy: Come on. Hurry up.

454
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,634
Billy: It's important.

455
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,429
Okay, so, mom, listen to this...

456
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,992
- I want to start!
- No, I want to start!

457
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,118
- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.

458
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,647
Why don't you both start it,

459
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,025
whatever it is, together?

460
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,820
- You ready?
- Yeah.

461
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,615
Three, two, one, go.

462
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:50,417
and if we get some ice cream

463
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,839
we promise to be good

464
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,578
Yes.

465
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,123
But so many others were lost.

466
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,418
Set me free.

467
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,086
I need to destroy the book.

468
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:37,047
No. It cannot be you.

469
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,099
Sara. No, no!

470
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,249
- What?
- Are you okay?

471
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,379
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

472
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,965
What?

473
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,683
No, no, no.

474
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,458
You are the sorcerer supreme.

475
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,876
Tell me what you know.

476
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,340
Not you.

477
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,009
Them.

478
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,281
A copy?

479
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,577
with the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.

480
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,127
Wundagore?

481
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,604
America: Hey!

482
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,648
Hey!

483
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,954
This universe sucks.

484
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:17,958
Cloak?

485
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,473
Hey, lab coat.

486
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,309
Where the hell are we?

487
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,787
Look, I don't know who you are,

488
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,688
or what you think
you're trying to do here,

489
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,189
but these situations don't usually

490
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,316
work out well

491
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,568
for the nameless scientists, so just...

492
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,449
Christine?

493
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,039
Miss Chavez.

494
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,628
you are in a highly secure
research facility.

495
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,005
The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak,

496
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,049
are here for surveillance and testing.

497
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,259
Uh... uh, testing?

498
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,641
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive,

499
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,147
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

500
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,234
I assume I have you
to thank for these, then?

501
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,407
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

502
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,617
838 Stephen?

503
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,285
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

504
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,287
Our universe is 838,

505
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,748
and we've designated yours 616.

506
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,751
Oh. You guys sure must know
a lot about the multiverse

507
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,087
if you got someone
going around naming realities.

508
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,254
Yes.

509
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,425
I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter foundation,

510
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,552
and I specialise
in multiversal research.

511
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,015
Doctor strange: So,
how'd you end up working here?

512
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,521
At your funeral.

513
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,065
Thank you for going.

514
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,609
Your injuries, they're similar,

515
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:20,247
What were we to each other
in this universe?

516
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
Yeah?

517
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,049
Well, that's something we got in common.

518
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,097
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

519
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,641
Everyone's in real danger.

520
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,768
Look, I know you don't know me...

521
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
And I don't want to.

522
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,939
Whatever I was to you in your universe

523
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,568
Why not?

524
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,241
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

525
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,457
and she's gonna rip this place
apart atom-by-atom

526
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,167
until she gets what she wants.

527
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,627
So I don't care
if you're from the avengers

528
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:08,712
or S.H.I.E.L.D...

529
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,838
838 mordo: We're neither.

530
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,928
Well, what then?

531
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,138
Hydra?

532
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,392
The illuminati will see you now.

533
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,769
The illumi-what-y?

534
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,159
It's gonna be okay.

535
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,944
My magic can only take us so far.

536
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,157
upon the forbidden grounds of wundagore.

537
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,854
Wong: Eons ago, the first demon, chthon,

538
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:57,571
These same spells were later transcribed
into the darkhold.

539
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,548
There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.

540
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,733
It's a throne.

541
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,478
838 mordo: Stephen strange,

542
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,773
you are now called
before the illuminati.

543
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,234
I, baron Karl mordo,

544
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,511
838 mordo: Captain Carter.

545
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,744
The first avenger.

546
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,122
Blackagar boltagon.

547
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,125
Keeper of the terrigen mists,
the inhuman king.

548
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,419
Blackagar boltagard? Huh.

549
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,383
Captain marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

550
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,470
And the smartest man alive,

551
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,145
"Fantastic four".
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

552
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,397
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

553
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,958
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head,

554
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,325
This strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

555
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,292
confuses and destabilises reality.

556
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,766
The larger the footprint
you leave behind,

557
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,588
the greater the risk of an incursion.

558
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,672
Incursion?

559
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,840
Reed: An lncursion occurs

560
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,010
when the boundary
between two universes erodes

561
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,386
and they collide,

562
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:13,141
destroying one or both entirely.

563
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,189
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

564
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,068
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

565
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,986
Captain marvel: So, before we vote,

566
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,823
if you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.

567
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,200
Doctor strange: Yeah, I do.

568
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,719
If it's lncursions you're worried about,

569
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,454
do you seriously think I'm a bigger
threat than the Scarlet witch?

570
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,665
Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to dreamwalk.

571
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,796
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

572
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,048
but it's not the Scarlet witch
that we fear.

573
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,883
From our experience, the greatest danger

574
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,927
to the multiverse, it turns out,

575
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,309
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

576
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,529
838 mordo: Our final member,

577
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,246
That's not how our strange died.

578
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,688
But I do wonder

579
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,734
when you could force america
to send you to any universe you want,

580
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,778
why take her power for your own?

581
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,697
You know it would kill her.

582
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,615
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

583
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,160
What if they get sick?

584
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,339
I won't lose them again.

585
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,509
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

586
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,219
But I can.

587
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,013
Look around you.

588
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,270
I was meant to rule everything.

589
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,825
Is there no peace in knowing

590
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,286
that even though you can't be
with the ones you love,

591
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:41,748
Is that not enough?

592
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,541
No.

593
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,082
Our strange did not die
defeating Thanos.

594
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,417
We were at war.

595
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,425
Stephen, as always,
chose to go it alone.

596
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,302
838 mordo: He turned to the darkhold,

597
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,765
in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the multiverse.

598
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,380
Captain marvel: And guess what?

599
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:45,103
It didn't.
But he kept doing it anyway.

600
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,399
confessed that
you had been dreamwalking,

601
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,860
and in your words,
"things had gotten out of hand."

602
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,575
an incursion.

603
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,250
Everyone in that reality died.

604
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,866
Prof Charles Xavier:
Stephen renounced the darkhold's evil

605
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:17,343
a weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.

606
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,679
But one final threat remained.

607
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,084
I shall miss you, my friend.

608
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,340
I'm ready.

609
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,642
I'm sorry.

610
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,763
You built a statue.

611
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,556
The world needs heroes.

612
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,438
What, perhaps,

613
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,363
The building's been breached.

614
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,490
No shit, genius.

615
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,273
Ultron sentry 1:
Stop where you...

616
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,540
Ultron sentry 2: Get back!

617
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,130
Ultron sentry 3:
Stop where you are...

618
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,506
She's heading for the child.

619
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,383
Watch him.
We'll vote on our return.

620
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,098
you must guide america Chavez.

621
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,558
What the hell are you saying?

622
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,018
Save the girl
and get to the book ofvishanti.

623
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,645
What? You have the book here?

624
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,064
Prof Charles Xavier:
Yes. You built a waypoint.

625
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,316
Charles, we cannot trust him.

626
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,739
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way

627
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,657
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

628
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,120
We will see what kind
of doctor strange you are.

629
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,913
Thank you.

630
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,627
All sentries engage.

631
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,297
Everybody out.

632
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,140
- Intruder approaching.
- 838 Christine: Now!

633
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,030
Ultron commands...

634
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,701
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

635
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,188
Reed: Wanda, stop.

636
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,902
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

637
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,902
Let her go.

638
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,073
Please.

639
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,785
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

640
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,287
Is their mother still alive?

641
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,498
Yes.

642
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,877
Good. There will be
someone left to raise them.

643
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:30,615
Take me to the book ofvishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

644
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,742
You are in no position to give orders.

645
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,079
My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.

646
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,635
Haven't you had enough?

647
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,262
Oh, I could do this all day.

648
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:32,259
Get the hell out of my universe!

649
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,837
They're not coming back.

650
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,215
And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.

651
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,721
Not that that ever bothered you before.

652
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,018
You know, you hated me
where I came from.

653
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,853
And I bet secretly, my brother,

654
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,187
you hated me here.

655
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:31,003
I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted.

656
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,576
I know that killing Stephen strange
was your ticket to getting the sanctum,

657
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,202
to becoming sorcerer supreme,

658
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,089
and to joining
your little circus of clowns,

659
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,122
the illuminati.

660
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,665
I'm ready...

661
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,629
To cast my vote now.

662
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,571
I think I'm beginning to understand

663
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,617
why your mordo
didn't like you very much!

664
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,246
You're sealed shut!

665
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,104
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

666
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,853
Prof Charles Xavier: Enough!

667
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,958
Help me. Please.

668
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,753
Wanda maximoff,
your mind is being held hostage

669
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,759
Grab my hand.

670
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,012
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble,

671
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,680
the spell will break.

672
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,479
Hey! You all right?

673
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:37,940
You okay?

674
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,401
Hey.

675
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:43,696
- You all right?
- America: Yeah.

676
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,448
Hey.

677
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,368
She fixed him.

678
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,804
- Doctor strange: Thank you.
- Yeah.

679
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,931
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to the book of vishanti.

680
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,141
How am I supposed to trust you?

681
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,293
I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did,

682
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,814
838 Christine: Yeah. Your way.

683
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:03,132
You sound a lot
like my Stephen right now.

684
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,693
He had to be the one holding the knife,

685
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,011
and then that knife
killed a trillion people.

686
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,762
America: This Stephen is different.

687
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,597
He is.

688
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,311
You're not like them.

689
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,985
Give me your hand.

690
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,411
Do not make me regret this.

691
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,662
I won't.

692
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:36,874
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

693
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,183
Under the river.

694
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,359
Go, go, go, go, go!

695
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,800
Where did she go?

696
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,020
I warned you.

697
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,315
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

698
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,525
hold your breath.

699
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,031
An enchantment
that's specific to me,

700
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,116
something only I would know.

701
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,892
- Wait. Stephen.
- Doctor strange: Come on.

702
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,313
Stephen.

703
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,697
Yeah.

704
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,659
Thank you.

705
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,543
Doctor strange: Open sesame.

706
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,202
Come on, kid.

707
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,037
You got this.

708
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,553
You all right?

709
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:18,845
Yeah.

710
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:24,434
This is the gap junction,
the space between universes.

711
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,787
Give me what I need.

712
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,153
My boys.

713
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,473
This isn't what your children
would want.

714
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,934
They'll never know.

715
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,185
Maybe not.

716
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,983
Oh, no.

717
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,485
Oh, crap.

718
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,989
838 Christine: It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

719
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,116
Doctor strange: Yeah.

720
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,642
838 Christine: So where are we going?

721
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,835
Doctor strange: Well,
if there's still a sanctum

722
01:26:57,087 --> 01:27:00,632
then there might be
another other other me,

723
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:19,109
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about incursions.

724
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,200
of stopping it.

725
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:40,982
Hello?

726
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,246
How did you get here?

727
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:56,581
By accident.

728
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,584
Who are you?

729
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,549
From the multiverse?

730
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:06,842
That's right.

731
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,516
We had a sister.

732
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,059
Donna.

733
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:19,938
But she, um...

734
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,483
She died when we were kids.

735
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,653
How?

736
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,827
We were playing
on a frozen lake and, uh...

737
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,833
She fell through the ice.

738
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,477
No, we don't.

739
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:03,815
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

740
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,443
Sinister strange: I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...

741
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,527
Doctor strange: Until?

742
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,906
Until I lost.

743
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,950
To whom?

744
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:22,083
I just want to get home.

745
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,835
Yeah? Believe me,

746
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,302
You guard the darkhold in this universe?

747
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,431
That's a start.

748
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,682
I could use it.

749
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,686
It could help me to communicate
with my universe.

750
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:44,397
The darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

751
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,400
I don't mean to be callous,

752
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,781
Not just on its reality.

753
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,494
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,

754
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,121
but maybe you could help
to save mine.

755
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,045
What?

756
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:12,300
Are you happy, Stephen?

757
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,691
I said, "yes, of course I'm happy.

758
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,068
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

759
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,946
"What man wouldn't be happy?"

760
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:38,868
And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house,

761
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:44,332
and wondered why I'd lied.

762
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,435
But I didn't find it.

763
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,230
All I found were more of us.

764
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,568
So I did those Stephens a favour.

765
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,947
You ever had that dream
where you're falling

766
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,743
as if you've been pushed off
a tall building?

767
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:35,717
The darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

768
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,393
I'll let you use the darkhold

769
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:47,395
if you give me your Christine.

770
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,439
Yeah.

771
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,608
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

772
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,236
Didn't think so.

773
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,870
What are you doing with the darkhold?

774
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,958
Are you going to dreamwalk?

775
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,838
All you stranges, you're the same.

776
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,386
We are all the same.

777
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:50,930
But right now, that kid needs me.

778
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:54,684
And I can't do any of this
without your help.

779
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,644
While I'm under,

780
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,187
I need you to protect my body

781
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,273
in case they attack me for trespassing.

782
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,737
The souls of the damned.

783
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:28,968
Okay.

784
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,099
so that you can dreamwalk into them?

785
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,394
Who said they had to be living?

786
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:57,098
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

787
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:00,476
Trespasser!

788
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,103
Male soul: Trespasser!

789
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:17,743
838 Christine: Stephen!

790
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,246
They're pulling me down.

791
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:22,957
838 Christine: Stephen!

792
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,216
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

793
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:34,010
Where are you?

794
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,622
The brazier of bom'galiath.

795
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,300
Go back to hell.

796
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,064
Stephen.

797
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,858
I've got you.

798
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,322
They're spirits.

799
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:37,448
Use them.

800
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:43,746
Use them.

801
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,184
Female soul: No!

802
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,114
Come on!

803
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,787
Uh-oh.

804
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:56,212
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me

805
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,546
to kill me.

806
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,432
Female soul: Murderer! Murderer!

807
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,254
Soul 1: No!

808
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,505
- Soul 2: No!
- Soul 3: No!

809
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:41,382
She's breaking free!

810
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,469
Strange, take america's power!

811
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,018
There's no other way.

812
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,496
It's me in other me's body.

813
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,253
You're here to take my power,
aren't you?

814
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,756
Before Wanda can.

815
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,136
I understand now.

816
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,143
No, america.

817
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:37,313
I've come here to tell you
to trust yourself.

818
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,064
Trust your power.

819
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,233
That's how we stop her.

820
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,486
I can't control it. I...

821
01:44:43,569 --> 01:44:45,571
Yes, you can.

822
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,198
You have been all along.

823
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,992
Every time you opened a portal,

824
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,620
you sent us
exactly where we needed to go.

825
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:56,081
What about the first time?

826
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,751
Even that led you to this moment...

827
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:03,422
When you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

828
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,071
I've got you.

829
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:55,850
Mm-mm-mm.

830
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,497
I can't beat you.

831
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,434
Billy. Tommy.

832
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,106
- Mom!
- Mommy!

833
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,399
Wait! Boys!

834
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:46,901
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

835
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
I'm your mother!

836
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,197
Get away from them.

837
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,742
Billy: Mom!

838
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,452
Dead strange: No.

839
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:57,578
Not yet.

840
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:06,642
Billy: You're not our mom!
Tommy: Get out!

841
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:19,767
Please don't hurt us.

842
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,185
Please.

843
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:23,938
I would never hurt you.

844
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,105
Never.

845
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,068
I would never hurt anyone.

846
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,321
I'm a...

847
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,377
I'm sorry.

848
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:55,511
Mom!

849
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,304
- Are you okay?
- 838 Wanda: Hi.

850
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:00,766
I'm okay.

851
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,950
- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, mom. Don't.

852
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,159
- It's okay.
- Mom.

853
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:04,204
Know that they'll be loved.

854
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,163
What now?

855
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:49,458
I'll find you.

856
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:00,135
We have to go. Now!

857
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,441
I opened the darkhold.

858
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,538
You all right?

859
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,832
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

860
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:15,752
She's on her way here to get us.

861
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,214
Wanda?

862
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:33,854
So she destroyed the darkhold
in every universe.

863
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:38,400
She did the right thing.

864
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,361
Yeah, she did.

865
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:51,205
838 Christine:
What's your universe like?

866
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:55,459
- It's very beautiful.
- Hmm.

867
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:01,423
I wish I could show you.

868
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:06,845
I'd really like that.

869
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:14,436
- But I have to go.
- Yeah.

870
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,110
It's too bad, though.

871
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,203
I love you.

872
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:37,000
I love you in every universe.

873
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:42,798
It's not that
I don't wanna care for someone

874
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,341
or have someone care for me.

875
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,717
It's just...

876
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:50,430
I get scared.

877
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:51,598
Yeah.

878
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,407
Face your fears...

879
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,152
Ay! How is this so much harder

880
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:46,778
than a multiversal portal?

881
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:51,283
She needs to slow down
and be more patient.

882
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:58,957
How you feeling?

883
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:00,584
Why do you ask?

884
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:10,177
Fine.

885
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,306
But I do wanna ask you something.

886
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:17,225
Are you happy?

887
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:20,395
That's a, um,

888
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,688
interesting question.

889
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:26,109
You'd think that saving the world
would get you there,

890
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:27,986
but it doesn't.

891
01:54:31,365 --> 01:54:35,452
Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.

892
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,289
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

893
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:46,755
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

894
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:48,006
No, we don't.

895
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:56,515
Hmm.

896
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:01,144
Wait.

897
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:05,690
'Sup.

898
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,318
Made some sparks.

899
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:09,945
Great.

900
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,072
Your parents would be proud.

901
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:23,333
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

902
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:26,586
So am I, kid.

903
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,084
Hmm.

904
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,005
Clea: Doctor strange?

905
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:01,593
Can I help you?

906
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,720
You caused an incursion,

907
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:21,821
Not in the least.

908
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:14,567
It's over!
