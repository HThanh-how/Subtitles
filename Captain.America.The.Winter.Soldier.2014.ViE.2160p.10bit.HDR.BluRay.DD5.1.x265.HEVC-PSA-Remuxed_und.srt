2
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,175
On your left.

3
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,104
On your left.

4
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,231
On my left. Got it.

5
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,363
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

6
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,990
- On your left.
- Come on!

7
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,417
Need a medic?

8
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,838
I need a new set of lungs.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,258
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,342
I guess I got a late start.

11
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,053
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,764
You should take another lap.

13
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,017
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,768
What unit you with?

15
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,312
58th Pararescue.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,022
But now I'm working down at the VA.

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,357
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,693
I kind of put that together.

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,322
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,866
It takes some getting used to.

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,451
It's good to meet you, Sam.

22
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,869
It's your bed, right?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,038
What's that?

24
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,623
Your bed, it's too soft.

25
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,458
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

26
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,543
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,880
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

28
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,256
Lying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,008
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

30
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,636
How long?

31
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,012
Two tours.

32
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,473
You must miss the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,893
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,479
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,855
No polio is good.

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,190
Internet, so helpful.

37
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,775
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

38
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,906
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.

39
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,575
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

40
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,702
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,754
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

42
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,589
If that's what you want to call running.

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,799
That's how it is?

44
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,925
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

45
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,929
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

46
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,432
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

47
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,226
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,773
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,733
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

50
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,151
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,611
That's hilarious.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,617
- How you doing?
- Hey.

53
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,370
Can't run everywhere.

54
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,454
No, you can't.

55
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,423
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

56
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,632
the Lemurian Star.

57
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,093
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

58
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,011
93 minutes ago.

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,972
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

60
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,807
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

61
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,978
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

62
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,646
I'm sure they have a good reason.

63
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,523
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,567
Relax. It's not that complicated.

65
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,860
How many pirates?

66
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,487
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,742
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,827
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

69
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,664
Before the French demobilized him,
he had 36 kill missions.

70
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,499
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,959
Hostages?

72
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,920
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

73
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,839
They're in the galley.

74
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,466
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

75
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,509
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

76
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,178
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

77
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,181
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

78
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,141
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

79
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,350
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,574
Secure channel seven.

81
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,784
Seven secure.

82
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,410
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,039
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

84
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,749
so, no, not really.

85
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,043
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.

86
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,254
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

87
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,131
That's why I don't ask.

88
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,635
Too shy, or too scared?

89
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,762
Too busy!

90
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,807
Was he wearing a parachute?

91
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,058
No.

92
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,726
No, he wasn't.

93
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,135
Hey!

94
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,050
Don't move.

95
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,221
Thanks.

96
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,474
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

97
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

98
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,940
She seems kind of nice.

99
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,650
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

100
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,443
I'm multi-tasking.

101
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,862
I told Batroc...

102
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,489
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

103
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,783
...start sending them bodies now!

104
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,703
I have a bullet for someone...

105
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,039
You want a bullet in your head?

106
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,874
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head...?

107
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,719
I don't like waiting.

108
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,013
Call Durand.

109
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,308
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

110
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,067
Start the engines.

111
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,485
Okay.

112
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,821
Hey, sailor.

113
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,633
Shut up.

114
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,262
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

115
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,979
All right, I've waited long enough...

116
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,567
Hey!

117
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,651
Find Batroc...

118
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,736
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

119
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,070
...I start killing them!

120
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll find him.

121
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,248
Two minutes.

122
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,990
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

123
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,412
Targets acquired.

124
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,164
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

125
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,333
Natasha, what's your status?

126
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,003
Status, Natasha.

127
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,171
Hang on!

128
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,355
Engine room secure.

129
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,073
Time is up.

130
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,076
Who dies first...?

131
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
You!

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
Get that one.

133
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,208
On my mark.

134
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,002
Three...

135
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,504
Two... One.

136
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,888
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

137
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,018
The line just went dead.

138
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,728
I've lost contact with them...

139
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,411
Hostages en route to extraction.

140
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,706
Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.

141
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,250
Hostiles are still in play.

142
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,752
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

143
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,005
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

144
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,048
Natasha.

145
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,212
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

146
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,977
Let's see.

147
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,296
Well, this is awkward.

148
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,926
What are you doing?

149
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,302
Backing up the hard drive.

150
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
It's a good habit to get into.

151
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,347
Rumlow needed your help.

152
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,765
What the hell are you doing here?

153
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,561
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

154
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,980
Whatever I can get my hands on.

155
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,523
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

156
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,483
No, that's your mission,

157
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,278
and you've done it beautifully.

158
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,239
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

159
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,782
I think that's overstating things.

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,926
Okay.

161
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,845
That one's on me.

162
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,222
You're damn right.

163
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,170
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

164
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,296
I didn't lie.

165
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,714
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

166
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,674
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

167
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,426
I'm not obliged to do anything.

168
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,011
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

169
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,806
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

170
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,100
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

171
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,935
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

172
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,314
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

173
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,735
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

174
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,987
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

175
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,364
I can't lead a mission

176
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,282
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

177
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,118
It's called compartmentalization.

178
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,996
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

179
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,915
Except you.

180
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,170
You're wrong about me.

181
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,255
I do share.

182
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm nice like that.

183
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,137
- Insight bay.
- Captain Rogers does not have

184
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,514
clearance for Project Insight.

185
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,183
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

186
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
Confirmed.

187
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,314
You know, they used to play music.

188
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,982
Yeah.

189
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,736
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

190
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,239
Granddad worked in a nice building.

191
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,657
Got good tips.

192
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,328
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

193
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,830
He'd say, "Hi."

194
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,915
People would say, "Hi" back.

195
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,127
Time went on,
the neighborhood got rougher.

196
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,211
He'd say, "Hi."

197
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,755
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

198
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,049
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

199
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,009
Did he ever get mugged?

200
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,973
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

201
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,850
What would he do?

202
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,184
He'd show them.

203
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,230
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

204
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,069
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

205
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,322
But he didn't trust them very much.

206
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,830
Yeah, I know.

207
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,374
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

208
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,119
This is Project Insight.

209
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,497
Three next-generation helicarriers

210
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,374
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

211
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,335
Launched from the Lemurian Star.

212
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,505
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

213
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:50,593
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

214
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,094
Stark?

215
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,387
He had a few suggestions

216
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,806
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

217
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,101
These new long-range precision guns

218
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,729
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

219
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,108
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

220
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,403
We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

221
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,489
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

222
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,115
We can't afford to wait that long.

223
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,784
Who's "we"?

224
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,245
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

225
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,705
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

226
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,792
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

227
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,462
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

228
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,132
You know, I read those SSR files.

229
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,009
"Greatest Generation"?

230
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,387
You guys did some nasty stuff.

231
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,138
Yeah, we compromised.

232
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,474
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

233
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,227
But we did it
so that people could be free.

234
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,646
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

235
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,191
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

236
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,362
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.

237
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,198
Don't hold your breath.

238
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,844
Welcome to the Smithsonian.

239
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,514
Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.

240
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,692
A symbol to the nation.

241
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,653
A hero to the world.

242
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,869
The story of Captain America
is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.

243
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,335
Denied enlistment due to poor health,

244
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,754
Steven Rogers was chosen
for a program

245
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,090
unique in the annals
of American warfare.

246
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:59,055
One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.

247
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,729
In this rare footage,

248
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,231
everyone's favorite war hero,
Captain America...

249
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,900
Battle tested,

250
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,068
Captain America

251
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,571
and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.

252
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,781
Their mission:

253
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,785
taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.

254
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,123
Best friends since childhood,

255
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,419
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable

256
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,463
on both schoolyard and battlefield.

257
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,927
Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life

258
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,638
in service of his country.

259
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,311
That was a difficult winter.

260
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,940
A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.

261
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,819
Steve, Captain Rogers,

262
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,655
he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade

263
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,408
that had pinned our allies
down for months.

264
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,786
He saved over 1,000 men.

265
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,372
Including the man who would...

266
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,626
Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.

267
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,296
Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.

268
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,801
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

269
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,311
I have lived a life.

270
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,442
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

271
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,696
What is it?

272
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,910
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

273
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,664
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

274
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,921
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

275
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,465
Serve.

276
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,720
It's just not the same.

277
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,722
You're always so dramatic.

278
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,562
Look, you saved the world.

279
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,860
We rather mucked it up.

280
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,528
You didn't.

281
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,783
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

282
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,659
Hey.

283
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,750
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

284
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,128
All we can do is our best.

285
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,549
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

286
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,058
Peggy.

287
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,898
Steve.

288
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,775
Yeah?

289
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,736
You're alive.

290
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,490
You came back.

291
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,741
Yeah, Peggy.

292
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,539
It's been so long.

293
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,543
So long.

294
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,129
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

295
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,423
Not when she owes me a dance.

296
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,806
Secure office.

297
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,608
Open Lemurian Star's
satellite launch file.

298
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,361
Access denied.

299
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
Run decryption.

300
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,617
Decryption failed.

301
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,495
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

302
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,542
Override denied. All files sealed.

303
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,210
On whose authority?

304
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,629
Fury, Nicholas J.

305
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,303
World Security Council.

306
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,679
Confirmed.

307
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,601
If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs

308
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,021
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.

309
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,397
This failure is unacceptable.

310
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,190
Considering this attack took place

311
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,151
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

312
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,737
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

313
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,822
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

314
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,116
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

315
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,285
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

316
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,162
Like how the hell did a French pirate

317
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,249
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

318
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,501
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

319
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,171
I can draw a map if it'd help.

320
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,174
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

321
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,928
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

322
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,348
Really? I don't.

323
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,352
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

324
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,272
If this Council is going to fall to rancor

325
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,025
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

326
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,320
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

327
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,031
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

328
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,161
Excuse me.

329
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,829
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

330
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,623
Depends on your definition.

331
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,468
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

332
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,762
A nuclear war would do it, too.

333
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,181
You busy in there?

334
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,891
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

335
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm here to ask a favor.

336
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,857
I want you to call for a vote.

337
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,151
Project Insight has to be delayed.

338
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,737
Nick, that's not a favor,

339
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,447
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

340
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,282
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

341
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,119
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

342
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,370
But if it's something?

343
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,373
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

344
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,459
Fine.

345
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,714
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

346
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,507
Thank you, sir.

347
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,593
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

348
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,431
The thing is,

349
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,017
I think it's getting worse.

350
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,562
A cop pulled me over last week.

351
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,022
He thought I was drunk.

352
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,693
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

353
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,904
I thought it was an IED.

354
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,075
Some stuff you leave there.

355
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,453
Other stuff you bring back.

356
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,539
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

357
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:44,918
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

358
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,129
It's up to you.

359
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,673
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

360
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,011
Look who it is, the running man.

361
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,306
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

362
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,476
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

363
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,394
Guilt,

364
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,063
regret.

365
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,190
You lose someone?

366
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,234
My wingman, Riley.

367
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,320
Flying a night mission.

368
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,822
Standard PJ rescue op.

369
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,075
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

370
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,870
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

371
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,332
Nothing I could do.

372
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,918
It's like I was up there just to watch.

373
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,004
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

374
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,800
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

375
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,012
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

376
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,475
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

377
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,684
So, hell yeah.

378
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:44,853
Are you thinking about getting out?

379
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,855
No.

380
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,025
I don't know.

381
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,113
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

382
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,656
Ultimate fighting?

383
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,867
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

384
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,453
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

385
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,497
What makes you happy?

386
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,084
I don't know.

387
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,338
Activating communications
encryption protocol.

388
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,841
Open secure line 0405.

389
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,342
Confirmed.

390
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,761
This is Hill.

391
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,763
I need you here in D.C.

392
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,683
Deep shadow conditions.

393
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,518
Give me four hours.

394
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,186
You have three. Over.

395
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,121
Want to see my lease?

396
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,265
Fracture detected.

397
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,812
Recommend anesthetic injection.

398
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,862
D.C. Metro Police dispatch
shows no units in this area.

399
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,202
Get me out of here.

400
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,206
Propulsion systems offline.

401
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,332
Then reboot, damn it!

402
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,729
Warning. Window
integrity compromised.

403
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,397
You think?

404
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,860
How long to propulsion?

405
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:57,945
Calculating.

406
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,284
Window integrity 31%.
Deploying countermeasures.

407
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,619
Hold that order!

408
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,456
Window integrity 19%.

409
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,707
Offensive measures advised.

410
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,125
Wait!

411
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,256
Window integrity 1%.

412
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,465
Now!

413
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,519
Propulsion systems now online.

414
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,853
Full acceleration! Now!

415
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,288
Initiate vertical takeoff!

416
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,455
Flight systems damaged.

417
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,499
Then activate guidance cameras!

418
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,878
Give me the wheel!

419
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,762
Get me Agent Hill.

420
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,180
Communications array damaged.

421
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:08,890
Well, what's not damaged?

422
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,226
Air conditioning is fully operational.

423
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,072
Traffic ahead.

424
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,115
Give me an alternate route.

425
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,034
Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge.

426
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,452
All vehicles stopped.

427
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,080
17th Avenue clear in three blocks,
directly ahead.

428
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,719
Warning. Approaching intersection.

429
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,856
Get me off the grid!

430
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,774
Calculating route to secure location.

431
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,435
So sweet. That is so nice.

432
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,437
Hi.

433
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,855
I got to go, though.

434
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:45,857
Okay. Bye.

435
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,652
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

436
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,404
Yeah.

437
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,074
Hey, if you want...

438
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,451
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

439
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,203
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

440
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,539
Yeah? What's it cost?

441
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,208
A cup of coffee?

442
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,629
Thank you, but

443
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,881
I already have a load in downstairs,

444
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,926
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

445
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,137
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

446
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,306
Well, I'll keep my distance.

447
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,641
Hopefully, not too far.

448
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,187
And I think you left your stereo on.

449
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,274
Right. Thank you.

450
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,483
Yeah.

451
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,031
I don't remember giving you a key.

452
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,035
You really think I'd need one?

453
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,663
My wife kicked me out.

454
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,499
I didn't know you were married.

455
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,211
A lot of things you don't know about me.

456
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,881
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

457
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,024
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

458
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,699
Who else knows about your wife?

459
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,536
Just...

460
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,874
My friends.

461
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,626
Is that what we are?

462
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,711
That's up to you.

463
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,692
Don't trust anyone.

464
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,779
Captain Rogers?

465
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,824
Captain,

466
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,118
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.

467
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,452
Kate?

468
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,163
I'm assigned to protect you.

469
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,540
On whose order?

470
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,792
His.

471
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,549
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

472
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,758
I need EMTs.

473
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,468
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?

474
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,470
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

475
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,115
Is he gonna make it?

476
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,658
I don't know.

477
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,703
Tell me about the shooter.

478
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,039
He's fast. Strong.

479
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,251
Had a metal arm.

480
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,841
Ballistics?

481
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,929
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

482
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
Soviet-made.

483
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,390
Yeah.

484
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,684
He's in V-tach.

485
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,561
- Crash cart coming in.
- Nurse, help me with the drape.

486
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,896
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

487
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,150
I want you to charge him at 100.

488
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,735
Don't do this to me, Nick.

489
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,195
Stand back.

490
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,571
Three, two,

491
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,490
one. Clear.

492
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,326
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

493
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,744
Okay, 200, please.

494
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,954
Stand back!

495
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
Three, two, one. Clear!

496
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,582
Get me epinephrine!

497
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,835
Pulse?

498
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,919
Negative.

499
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

500
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,903
What's the time?

501
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,071
1:03, Doctor.

502
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,951
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

503
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,032
I need to take him.

504
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,088
Natasha.

505
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,978
Natasha!

506
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,898
Why was Fury in your apartment?

507
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,026
I don't know.

508
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,694
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

509
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,363
Yeah, give me a second.

510
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,489
They want you now.

511
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,158
Okay.

512
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,413
You're a terrible liar.

513
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,129
S.T.R.I.K.E. team,
escort Captain Rogers

514
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,715
back to S.H.I.E.L.D.
immediately for questioning.

515
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,342
I told him.

516
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,850
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

517
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,687
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

518
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,578
Captain Rogers.

519
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,080
Neighbor.

520
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,834
Captain.

521
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,293
I'm Alexander Pierce.

522
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,337
Sir, it's an honor.

523
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,588
The honor's mine, Captain.

524
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,258
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

525
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,053
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

526
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,639
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

527
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,308
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

528
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,771
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

529
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,442
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

530
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,901
and he comes to me with a plan.

531
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,945
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

532
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,906
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

533
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,494
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

534
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,830
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

535
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,457
They find it empty.

536
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,543
Nick had ignored my direct order,

537
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,088
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

538
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,883
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

539
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,301
including my daughter.

540
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,053
So you gave him a promotion.

541
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
I've never had any cause to regret it.

542
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,100
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

543
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,272
I don't know.

544
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,858
Did you know it was bugged?

545
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,070
I did, because Nick told me.

546
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,031
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

547
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,997
I want you to see something.

548
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,166
Who hired you, Batroc?

549
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,459
Is that live?

550
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,213
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

551
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,509
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

552
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,512
No, no. It's more complicated than that.

553
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,264
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

554
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:23,976
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

555
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,564
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

556
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,025
The last one going to
a holding company

557
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,402
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

558
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,904
Am I supposed to know who that is?

559
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

560
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,243
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

561
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,288
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

562
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,252
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

563
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,420
The prevailing theory

564
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,299
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

565
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,885
and sale of classified intelligence.

566
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,515
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

567
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,437
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

568
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,774
Why do you think we're talking?

569
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,947
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

570
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,909
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

571
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,707
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

572
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,918
to build a really better world

573
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,797
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

574
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,467
And that makes enemies.

575
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,639
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

576
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,601
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

577
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,688
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

578
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,609
makes me really, really angry.

579
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,865
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

580
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,950
I don't think that's an accident.

581
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,119
And I don't think you do, either.

582
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,165
So, I'm gonna ask again.

583
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,375
Why was he there?

584
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,589
He told me not to trust anyone.

585
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,052
I wonder if that included him.

586
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,141
I'm sorry.

587
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,601
Those were his last words.

588
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,437
Excuse me.

589
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,317
Captain,

590
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,528
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

591
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,990
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

592
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,743
Anyone.

593
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,122
Understood.

594
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,058
Operations Control.

595
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,643
Confirmed.

596
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,272
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

597
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,690
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

598
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,108
- Forensics.
- Confirmed.

599
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,484
Cap.

600
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,860
Rumlow.

601
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,206
Evidence Response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see.

602
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,958
You want me to get the tac team ready?

603
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,710
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

604
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,961
Right.

605
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,516
What's the status so far?

606
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,352
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.

607
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,354
Excuse me.

608
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,865
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

609
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,034
It's messed up, what happened to him.

610
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,577
Thank you.

611
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,555
Records.

612
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,890
Confirmed.

613
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,574
Before we get started,

614
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,285
does anyone want to get out?

615
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,196
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

616
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,838
Whoa, big guy.

617
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,633
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

618
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,521
It kind of feels personal.

619
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,532
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

620
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,718
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

621
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,553
You have nowhere to go!

622
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,491
Are you kidding me?

623
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,701
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

624
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,299
Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.

625
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,927
Repeat, stand down.

626
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,965
Eyes here.

627
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,259
Whatever your op is, bury it.

628
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,468
This is Level One.

629
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,720
Contact DOT.

630
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,472
All traffic lights in the district go red.

631
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,100
Shut all runways at BWI,

632
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,143
IAD and Reagan.

633
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,980
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

634
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,274
Scan all open sources,

635
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,192
phones, computers,

636
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,819
PDAs. Whatever.

637
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,821
If someone tweets about this guy,

638
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,072
I want to know about it.

639
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,324
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

640
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,286
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

641
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,204
Because he lied to us.

642
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,334
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

643
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,461
He refused to share it.

644
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,631
As difficult as this is to accept,

645
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,011
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

646
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,623
- Where is it?
- Safe.

647
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,416
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

648
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,876
Why would I tell you?

649
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,128
Fury gave it to you. Why?

650
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,713
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

651
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,922
Stop lying.

652
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,549
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

653
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,552
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

654
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,973
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

655
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,391
I'm not gonna ask you again.

656
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,478
I know who killed Fury.

657
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,901
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

658
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,945
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

659
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,156
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

660
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,241
in the last 50 years.

661
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,243
So he's a ghost story.

662
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,664
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

663
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,166
Somebody shot out
my tires near Odessa.

664
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,627
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

665
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,128
I pulled us out.

666
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,214
But the Winter Soldier was there.

667
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,258
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

668
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,593
straight through me.

669
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,512
Soviet slug.

670
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,723
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

671
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,102
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

672
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,357
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

673
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,777
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

674
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,534
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

675
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,869
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

676
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,788
To any reasonable person,

677
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,499
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

678
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,959
You know what makes him a traitor?

679
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,461
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

680
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,964
Nick Fury used your friendship

681
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,175
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

682
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,636
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

683
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,889
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

684
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,392
Are you calling for my resignation?

685
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,977
I've got a pen and paper right here.

686
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,730
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

687
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,482
But you do want to have a discussion?

688
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,568
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

689
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:03,031
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

690
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,661
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

691
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,087
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

692
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,174
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

693
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,637
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

694
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,723
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

695
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,849
How much time will we have?

696
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,518
About nine minutes from

697
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,188
now.

698
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,153
Fury was right about that ship.

699
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,447
Somebody's trying to hide something.

700
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,616
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

701
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,202
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

702
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,037
Can you override it?

703
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,748
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

704
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,541
Slightly.

705
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,595
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

706
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,306
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

707
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,891
to track hostile malware,

708
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,852
so if we can't read the file,

709
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,646
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

710
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,231
Can I help you guys with anything?

711
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,610
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

712
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,737
Right. We're getting married.

713
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,656
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

714
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,243
New Jersey.

715
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,833
I have the exact same glasses.

716
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,418
Wow, you two are practically twins.

717
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,087
Yeah, I wish.

718
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,588
Specimen.

719
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,341
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

720
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,425
Thank you.

721
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,264
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

722
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,599
Got it.

723
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,855
You know it?

724
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,481
I used to. Let's go.

725
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,860
Standard tac team.

726
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,403
Two behind, two across,

727
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,196
and two coming straight at us.

728
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,116
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

729
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,243
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

730
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,661
- What?
- Do it.

731
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:21,962
Negative at the source.

732
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,130
Give me a floor rundown.

733
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,798
Negative on three.

734
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,216
Negative on two.

735
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,802
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

736
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,811
- Kiss me.
- What?

737
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,022
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

738
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,356
Yes, they do.

739
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,409
You still uncomfortable?

740
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,828
It's not exactly the word I would use.

741
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,089
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

742
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,592
Nazi Germany.

743
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,053
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

744
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,852
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

745
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,437
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

746
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,855
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

747
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,566
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

748
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,526
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

749
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,278
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

750
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,488
No, I didn't.

751
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,490
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

752
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,325
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

753
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,744
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

754
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,871
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

755
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,998
Nobody special, though?

756
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,293
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

757
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,671
to find someone with
shared life experience.

758
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,339
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

759
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,716
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

760
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,051
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

761
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,553
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

762
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,889
Neither am I.

763
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,891
That's a tough way to live.

764
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,186
It's a good way not to die, though.

765
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,522
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

766
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,190
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

767
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,359
Yeah.

768
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,655
Who do you want me to be?

769
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,615
How about a friend?

770
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:21,164
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

771
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,306
This is it.

772
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,476
The file came from these coordinates.

773
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,687
So did I.

774
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,613
This camp is where I was trained.

775
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,784
Change much?

776
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,663
A little.

777
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,999
Pick up the pace, ladies!

778
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,792
Let's go! Let's go!

779
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,878
Double time!

780
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,173
Come on, Rogers, move it!

781
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,511
Come on, fall in!

782
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,638
Rogers!

783
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,307
I said fall in!

784
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,810
This is a dead end.

785
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,772
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

786
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,026
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

787
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,987
What is it?

788
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,989
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

789
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,116
within 500 yards of the barracks.

790
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,952
This building is in the wrong place.

791
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,178
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

792
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,972
Maybe where it started.

793
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,742
And there's Stark's father.

794
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,702
Howard.

795
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,288
Who's the girl?

796
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,018
If you're already working
in a secret office,

797
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,156
why do you need to hide the elevator?

798
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:54,628
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

799
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,618
Y-E-S spells yes.

800
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,582
Shall we play a game?

801
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,585
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

802
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,802
Rogers, Steven,

803
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,513
born 1918.

804
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,394
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,

805
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,437
born 1984.

806
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,981
It's some kind of recording.

807
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,525
I am not a recording, Fräulein.

808
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,902
I may not be the man I was

809
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,364
when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.

810
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,491
But I am.

811
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,744
You know this thing?

812
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:16,167
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

813
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,585
He's been dead for years.

814
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,088
First correction, I am Swiss.

815
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,882
Second, look around you.

816
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,677
I have never been more alive.

817
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,515
In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.

818
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,476
Science could not save my body.

819
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:37,897
My mind, however,
that was worth saving,

820
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:41,860
on 200,000 feet of databanks.

821
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,655
You are standing in my brain.

822
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,074
- How did you get here?
- Invited.

823
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,910
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

824
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,748
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

825
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,083
They thought I could help their cause.

826
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,127
I also helped my own.

827
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,837
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

828
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,924
Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.

829
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,760
Prove it.

830
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,055
Accessing archive.

831
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,933
HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity

832
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,270
could not be trusted
with its own freedom.

833
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,148
What we did not realize was
that if you try

834
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,151
to take that freedom, they resist.

835
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,570
The war taught us much.

836
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:29,449
Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.

837
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,328
After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,

838
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,622
and I was recruited.

839
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,083
The new HYDRA grew.

840
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:42,545
A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

841
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,631
For 70 years,

842
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:50,428
HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,

843
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,306
and when history did not cooperate,

844
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,809
history was changed.

845
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,311
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

846
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,814
Accidents will happen.

847
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:05,652
HYDRA created a world so chaotic

848
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,697
that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom

849
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,033
to gain its security.

850
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,079
Once a purification process
is complete,

851
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,999
HYDRA's new world order will arise.

852
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,836
We won, Captain.

853
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:26,506
Your death amounts to
the same as your life.

854
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,049
A zero sum.

855
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,555
As I was saying...

856
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,432
What's on this drive?

857
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,935
Project Insight requires insight.

858
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,938
So, I wrote an algorithm.

859
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,606
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

860
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,192
The answer to your question
is fascinating.

861
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:50,697
Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.

862
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:57,954
Steve, we got a bogey.

863
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,956
Short range ballistic.

864
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,958
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

865
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,042
S.H.I.E.L.D.

866
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,963
I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.

867
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,548
Admit it.

868
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,967
It's better this way.

869
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,552
We are, both of us,

870
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,138
out of time.

871
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,098
Call in the asset.

872
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,699
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

873
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,034
You need anything before I leave?

874
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,122
No... It's fine, Renata, you can go home.

875
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,457
Okay. Night-night.

876
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,334
Good night.

877
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,841
Want some milk?

878
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,311
The timetable has moved.

879
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,189
Our window is limited.

880
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,362
Two targets, Level Six.

881
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,033
They already cost me Zola.

882
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,452
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

883
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,539
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

884
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,333
I forgot my

885
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,667
phone.

886
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,842
Renata, I wish you would have knocked.

887
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,493
Hey, man.

888
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:27,080
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

889
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,915
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

890
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,378
Not everyone.

891
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,021
- You okay?
- Yeah.

892
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,448
What's going on?

893
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,122
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

894
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,878
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

895
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,845
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

896
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,393
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

897
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,354
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

898
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,736
I owe you.

899
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,321
It's okay.

900
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,074
If it was the other way around,

901
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,785
and it was down to me to save your life,

902
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,495
now you be honest with me,

903
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,541
would you trust me to do it?

904
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,711
I would now.

905
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,507
And I'm always honest.

906
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:03,968
Well, you seem pretty chipper

907
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,845
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

908
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,433
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

909
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,310
I made breakfast.

910
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,897
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

911
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,858
So, the question is,

912
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,027
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

913
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,113
Pierce.

914
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,033
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

915
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,367
But he's not working alone.

916
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,870
Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.

917
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,539
So was Jasper Sitwell.

918
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,504
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

919
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,632
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

920
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,343
The answer is, you don't.

921
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,054
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

922
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,267
Is this Bakhmala?

923
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,894
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

924
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,022
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

925
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,901
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

926
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,362
I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.

927
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,780
What did you use? A stealth chute?

928
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:06,906
No.

929
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,075
These.

930
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,289
I thought you said you were a pilot.

931
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,916
I never said pilot.

932
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,672
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

933
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,715
You got out for a good reason.

934
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,425
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

935
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,177
There's no better reason to get back in.

936
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,599
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

937
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:34,934
The last one is at Fort Meade.

938
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,479
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

939
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,650
Shouldn't be a problem.

940
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,987
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

941
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,948
because I got
some constituency problem

942
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,033
and I got to press the flesh.

943
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,536
Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?

944
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,496
No, not really.

945
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,374
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

946
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,126
Real hot, you know?

947
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,461
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

948
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,671
Who listens at that point?

949
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,506
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

950
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,800
Really? Because she's killing my back.

951
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,511
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

952
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,762
This is a nice pin.

953
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,141
- Thank you.
- Come here.

954
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,310
Hail HYDRA.

955
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,315
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

956
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,775
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

957
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:34,660
I need a minute.

958
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,537
Bring the car around.

959
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,334
Yes, sir?

960
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,085
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?

961
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,880
I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.

962
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,048
Who is this?

963
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,884
The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.

964
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,137
Your other 10 o'clock.

965
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,015
There you go.

966
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,353
What do you want?

967
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,355
You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.

968
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:05,066
There's a gray car two spaces down.

969
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,109
You and I are gonna take a ride.

970
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,028
And why would I do that?

971
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,781
Because that tie looks really expensive,

972
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,200
and I'd hate to mess it up.

973
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,044
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

974
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,129
Never heard of it.

975
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,255
What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?

976
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,049
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

977
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:38,432
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

978
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:40,977
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

979
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,229
You're right.

980
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,147
It's not.

981
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,691
It's hers.

982
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,197
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

983
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,574
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

984
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,826
Yeah, she's cute.

985
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,411
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

986
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,341
Zola's algorithm is a program

987
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,136
for choosing

988
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,887
- Insight's targets.
- What targets?

989
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,347
You!

990
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,726
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defense,

991
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,353
a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,

992
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,522
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

993
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,524
to HYDRA.

994
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,443
Now, or in the future.

995
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,528
In the future? How could it know?

996
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,158
How could it not?

997
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,621
The 21st century is a digital book.

998
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,791
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

999
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,837
Your bank records,

1000
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:51,672
medical histories, voting patterns,

1001
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,300
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1002
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,180
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1003
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,307
to predict their future.

1004
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,683
And what then?

1005
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,897
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1006
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,523
What then?

1007
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:15,196
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1008
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,283
A few million at a time.

1009
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,000
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1010
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,835
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1011
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,337
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1012
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,546
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1013
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,673
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1014
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,258
and access the helicarriers directly.

1015
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:37,510
What? Are you crazy?

1016
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,137
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1017
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,015
Shit!

1018
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,778
Hang on!

1019
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,131
I have her. Find him.

1020
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,406
Go! I got this!

1021
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,114
Taking fire above
and below expressway.

1022
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,742
Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.

1023
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,624
I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.

1024
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:19,875
Rendezvous, two minutes.

1025
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,318
Get out of the way!

1026
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,487
Stay out of the way!

1027
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,595
Bucky?

1028
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,597
Who the hell is Bucky?

1029
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,794
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1030
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,420
Get on your knees!

1031
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:13,215
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1032
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,424
Down!

1033
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:15,968
Don't move.

1034
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,226
Put the gun down.

1035
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,353
Not here. Not here!

1036
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:42,911
It was him.

1037
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,668
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1038
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,921
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1039
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,339
Zola.

1040
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,133
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1041
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,176
Zola experimented on him.

1042
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:00,679
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1043
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:03,682
They must have found him and...

1044
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,684
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1045
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,023
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1046
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,069
We need to get a doctor here.

1047
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,279
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1048
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,780
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1049
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,499
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1050
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,670
Who is this guy?

1051
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,433
Three holes. Start digging.

1052
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,504
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1053
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:16,922
Maybe two.

1054
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,091
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1055
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,228
About damn time.

1056
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,815
Lacerated spinal column,

1057
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,775
cracked sternum,

1058
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,443
shattered collarbone,

1059
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,278
perforated liver,

1060
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,197
and one hell of a headache.

1061
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:43,782
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1062
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,283
Let's not forget that.

1063
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,119
Otherwise, I'm good.

1064
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:49,621
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1065
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,873
Tetrodotoxin B.

1066
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:54,042
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1067
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,044
Banner developed it for stress.

1068
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,839
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1069
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,924
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1070
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,385
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1071
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,096
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1072
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,514
Besides,

1073
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,308
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1074
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,159
Sergeant Barnes.

1075
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,328
Bucky, no!

1076
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,127
The procedure has already started.

1077
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,676
You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

1078
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,094
Put him on ice.

1079
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,482
Sir.

1080
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,692
He's unstable.

1081
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,611
Erratic.

1082
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:16,958
Mission report.

1083
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:21,797
Mission report now.

1084
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,019
The man on the bridge.

1085
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,398
Who was he?

1086
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,069
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1087
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,490
I knew him.

1088
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,751
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1089
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,421
You shaped the century.

1090
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,591
And I need you to do it one more time.

1091
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:11,555
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1092
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,432
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1093
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:18,770
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1094
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:23,275
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1095
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,904
But I knew him.

1096
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,954
Prep him.

1097
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:38,748
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1098
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:40,959
Then wipe him and start over.

1099
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:26,254
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1100
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:30,258
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1101
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:32,802
it was a responsibility.

1102
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:37,057
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1103
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,059
We have to stop the launch.

1104
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,771
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

1105
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,358
What's that?

1106
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:49,402
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1107
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:52,822
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponized.

1108
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,200
We need to breach those carriers

1109
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,953
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1110
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,037
One or two won't cut it.

1111
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,748
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1112
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:05,293
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1113
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,295
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1114
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:10,674
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1115
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,093
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1116
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,388
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1117
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,597
We're not salvaging anything.

1118
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,057
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1119
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,308
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1120
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,685
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1121
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,062
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1122
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,231
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1123
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,233
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1124
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,569
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1125
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,613
How many paid the price
before you did?

1126
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,410
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1127
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:39,995
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1128
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:43,415
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?

1129
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:46,418
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1130
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,919
it all goes.

1131
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,629
He's right.

1132
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,469
Don't look at me.

1133
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,555
I do what he does, just slower.

1134
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,935
Well...

1135
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,610
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1136
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,707
We looked for you, after.

1137
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,002
My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.

1138
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,797
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1139
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,300
How was it?

1140
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,260
It was okay.

1141
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,637
She's next to Dad.

1142
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,390
I was gonna ask...

1143
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,267
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1144
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:46,936
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1145
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,646
like when we were kids.

1146
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,816
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1147
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,902
maybe take out the trash.

1148
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,366
Come on.

1149
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,831
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1150
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:11,419
The thing is, you don't have to.

1151
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,341
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1152
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,012
He's gonna be there, you know.

1153
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,138
I know.

1154
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:26,351
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1155
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,187
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1156
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,855
He's the kind you stop.

1157
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,110
I don't know if I can do that.

1158
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,403
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1159
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,072
He doesn't know you.

1160
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:40,824
He will.

1161
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,869
Gear up. It's time.

1162
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,623
You gonna wear that?

1163
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,252
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1164
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,594
Oh, man.

1165
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,472
I am so fired.

1166
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,624
We are in final launch sequence.

1167
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:35,170
We are go on guidance.

1168
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,215
All personnel to launch stations.

1169
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:41,134
And how was your flight?

1170
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:42,385
Lovely.

1171
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:44,971
The ride from the airport, less so.

1172
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:47,599
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1173
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,684
Including Captain America.

1174
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,690
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1175
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,776
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1176
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:03,907
I've been parking there for two months.

1177
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,700
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1178
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,160
I think Afghanistan.

1179
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:09,245
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1180
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:10,747
Well, he could've said something.

1181
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:13,708
Must be the dish.

1182
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,128
I'll check it out.

1183
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:20,965
Triskelion command request
we clear the area for launch.

1184
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:25,595
Excuse us.

1185
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:28,139
I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,

1186
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,976
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1187
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,188
Finally, we're here.

1188
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:37,857
And the world should be grateful.

1189
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,526
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

1190
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,487
this is Steve Rogers.

1191
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,491
You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.

1192
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:49,786
Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.

1193
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,373
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1194
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,670
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1195
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,588
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1196
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,383
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1197
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,847
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.

1198
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,099
I don't know how many more,

1199
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,393
but I know they're in the building.

1200
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,063
They could be standing
right next to you.

1201
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,316
They almost have what they want.

1202
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,194
Absolute control.

1203
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,029
They shot Nick Fury.

1204
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,282
And it won't end there.

1205
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,034
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1206
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,203
HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.

1207
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:36,874
Unless we stop them.

1208
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,005
I know I'm asking a lot.

1209
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:47,093
But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.

1210
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:49,721
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1211
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,892
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1212
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,313
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1213
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:06,362
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1214
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:08,489
You smug son of a bitch.

1215
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,619
Arrest him.

1216
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:18,124
I guess I've got the floor.

1217
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,925
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1218
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,806
Is there a problem?

1219
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,937
Is there a problem?

1220
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,189
I'm sorry, sir.

1221
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,116
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1222
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:56,120
Captain's orders.

1223
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:57,580
Move away from your station.

1224
01:37:57,955 --> 01:37:58,998
Like he said...

1225
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,208
Hold it right there.

1226
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,626
Put the gun down!

1227
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:02,794
Captain's orders.

1228
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,631
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1229
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,093
Depends on where you're standing.

1230
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:55,930
Close the bay door!

1231
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,348
Close the bay door now!

1232
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:58,808
Close the bay door!

1233
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:19,871
They're initiating launch.

1234
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,685
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1235
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:44,353
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1236
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,721
Hey, Cap,

1237
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,932
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1238
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,016
You okay?

1239
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:25,686
I'm not dead yet.

1240
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:34,403
Let me ask you a question.

1241
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:40,034
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1242
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:43,454
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1243
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,457
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1244
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:52,213
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1245
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:53,589
Wouldn't you?

1246
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,424
Wouldn't you all?

1247
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:58,803
Not if it was your switch.

1248
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,537
I'm sorry.

1249
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,503
Did I step on your moment?

1250
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,340
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1251
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,467
Falcon, status?

1252
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:39,885
Engaging.

1253
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:05,286
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1254
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:08,706
Oh, shit.

1255
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:40,696
Eight minutes, Cap.

1256
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,573
Working on it.

1257
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:51,957
What are you doing?

1258
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,626
She's disabling security protocols

1259
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:55,461
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1260
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,254
- Including HYDRA's.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1261
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,674
If you do this,

1262
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,592
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1263
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:07,181
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1264
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,933
as you really are?

1265
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:11,102
Are you?

1266
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:28,411
Alpha lock.

1267
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,831
Falcon, where are you now?

1268
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:32,915
I had to take a detour.

1269
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:07,116
Oh, yeah!

1270
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:14,165
I'm in.

1271
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:19,628
Bravo lock.

1272
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:22,715
Two down, one to go.

1273
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,510
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1274
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:30,014
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1275
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,142
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1276
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:17,019
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1277
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,188
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1278
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,921
Did you get my flowers?

1279
01:45:46,632 --> 01:45:48,300
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1280
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:52,137
Because I thought you had me killed.

1281
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:53,806
You know how the game works.

1282
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,600
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1283
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:57,977
Because you were the best,

1284
01:45:58,143 --> 01:45:59,603
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1285
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,147
I did what I did to protect people.

1286
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,025
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1287
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,279
Disorder. War.

1288
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,615
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1289
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,951
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1290
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,954
Diplomacy?

1291
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:19,456
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1292
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,294
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1293
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:27,756
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1294
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:33,262
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1295
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:35,598
by sacrificing 20 million.

1296
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,101
It's the next step, Nick.

1297
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,436
If you have the courage to take it.

1298
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,730
No. I have the courage not to.

1299
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,153
Retinal scanner active.

1300
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,990
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1301
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:55,117
I know you erased my password.

1302
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,244
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1303
01:46:57,786 --> 01:47:00,623
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,

1304
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:07,588
you need to keep both eyes open.

1305
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:13,510
Alpha level confirmed.

1306
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,846
Encryption code accepted.

1307
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,181
Safeguards removed.

1308
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:20,559
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1309
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,358
Six minutes.

1310
01:47:27,524 --> 01:47:29,985
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1311
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:32,529
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1312
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:36,367
I just did!

1313
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:56,053
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1314
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,346
I had a big breakfast.

1315
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,266
Steve!

1316
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,132
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1317
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:35,009
Yeah, I'm here.

1318
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,593
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1319
01:48:37,636 --> 01:48:39,263
- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.

1320
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:42,224
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1321
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,935
Don't worry. I got it.

1322
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:48,439
Emergency evacuation alert.

1323
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:51,608
All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.

1324
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:55,112
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1325
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:02,911
Sir, the Council's been breached.

1326
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:05,622
- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black Widow's up there.

1327
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:07,166
Headed up.

1328
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:10,627
- Falcon?
- Yeah.

1329
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:11,712
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1330
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:12,796
I'm on it.

1331
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:25,434
People are gonna die, Buck.

1332
01:49:27,561 --> 01:49:29,021
I can't let that happen.

1333
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:38,822
Please don't make me do this.

1334
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:49,893
Done.

1335
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:52,062
And it's trending.

1336
01:50:59,736 --> 01:51:01,572
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1337
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,739
I'd put that gun down.

1338
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,411
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1339
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:42,321
Drop it!

1340
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:43,947
Drop it!

1341
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:07,721
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1342
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:16,021
This is gonna hurt.

1343
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:20,400
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1344
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:22,819
And order only comes through pain.

1345
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,615
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1346
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,743
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1347
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:31,912
65 seconds to satellite link.

1348
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:34,998
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1349
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:40,087
One minute.

1350
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:01,525
30 seconds, Cap.

1351
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:04,319
Stand by.

1352
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:08,991
Charlie...

1353
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:19,543
We've reached 3,000 feet.

1354
01:53:20,585 --> 01:53:21,586
Sat link coming online now.

1355
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,215
Deploy algorithm.

1356
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,010
Algorithm deployed.

1357
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:30,721
We are go to target.

1358
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,158
Target saturation reached.

1359
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:52,576
All targets assigned.

1360
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:53,660
Fire when ready.

1361
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,372
Firing in...

1362
01:53:57,539 --> 01:53:58,582
Three,

1363
01:53:58,874 --> 01:53:59,916
two...

1364
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:02,419
One.

1365
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:06,131
Charlie lock.

1366
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:07,591
Where are the targets?

1367
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,093
Where are the targets?

1368
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:11,928
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1369
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:30,364
Fire now.

1370
01:54:31,448 --> 01:54:32,699
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1371
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:34,618
Do it now!

1372
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,149
What a waste.

1373
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:09,528
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1374
01:55:09,736 --> 01:55:12,781
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1375
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:14,783
You're going to fly me out of here.

1376
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:18,161
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1377
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,663
You already did.

1378
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,790
You will again, when it's useful.

1379
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,263
Romanoff.

1380
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,098
Natasha.

1381
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:41,935
Natasha! Come on!

1382
01:55:48,984 --> 01:55:50,527
Those really do sting.

1383
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,978
Hail HYDRA.

1384
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:21,910
You're out of your depth, kid.

1385
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:27,123
Son of a bitch!

1386
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:40,845
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1387
01:57:41,638 --> 01:57:42,764
Sam, where are you?

1388
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,475
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1389
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:47,227
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1390
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:48,520
Not an option!

1391
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:05,495
41st floor! 41st!

1392
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:09,165
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1393
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:13,044
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1394
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:30,604
You know me.

1395
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:33,690
No, I don't!

1396
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,534
Bucky.

1397
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,495
You've known me your whole life.

1398
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:58,965
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1399
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,383
Shut up!

1400
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,560
I'm not gonna fight you.

1401
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:15,899
You're my friend.

1402
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:24,282
You're my mission.

1403
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:28,578
You're my mission!

1404
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:32,916
Then finish it.

1405
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,588
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1406
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:51,596
On your left.

1407
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:44,983
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1408
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,276
and nothing but the truth?

1409
02:02:46,484 --> 02:02:47,902
I do.

1410
02:02:49,904 --> 02:02:51,614
Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?

1411
02:02:54,325 --> 02:02:56,244
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1412
02:02:56,452 --> 02:02:58,288
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1413
02:02:58,496 --> 02:02:59,664
made his point fairly eloquently.

1414
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:00,832
Well, he could explain how

1415
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,626
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1416
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:07,922
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1417
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:10,300
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1418
02:03:10,466 --> 02:03:13,344
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1419
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:14,804
Agent, you should know

1420
02:03:14,971 --> 02:03:16,639
that there are some on this committee

1421
02:03:16,848 --> 02:03:18,975
who feel, given your service record,

1422
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,894
both for this country and against it,

1423
02:03:21,644 --> 02:03:23,396
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1424
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:25,565
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1425
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:29,068
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1426
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:33,990
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1427
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,826
Do enlighten us.

1428
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:38,453
Because you need us.

1429
02:03:39,579 --> 02:03:41,831
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,

1430
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,208
and yes, we help make it that way.

1431
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:47,503
But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.

1432
02:03:49,172 --> 02:03:51,132
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1433
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:53,843
You'll know where to find me.

1434
02:04:29,337 --> 02:04:32,173
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1435
02:04:32,674 --> 02:04:34,217
You get used to it.

1436
02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:39,097
We've been data mining HYDRA's files.

1437
02:04:39,305 --> 02:04:41,432
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1438
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,352
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1439
02:04:45,311 --> 02:04:46,562
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1440
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,357
There's something I got to do first.

1441
02:04:50,274 --> 02:04:52,819
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1442
02:04:53,861 --> 02:04:55,571
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1443
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:58,449
All right, then.

1444
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:07,291
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1445
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:10,670
You should be honored.
That's about as close as he gets

1446
02:05:10,878 --> 02:05:12,505
to saying thank you.

1447
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:14,757
Not going with him?

1448
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:16,509
No.

1449
02:05:16,718 --> 02:05:18,720
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1450
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:21,597
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1451
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:22,932
That might take a while.

1452
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:25,059
I'm counting on it.

1453
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:28,396
That thing you asked for,

1454
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:31,065
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1455
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,779
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

1456
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:38,406
She's not a nurse.

1457
02:05:38,614 --> 02:05:40,450
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1458
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:43,453
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1459
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,204
She's nice.

1460
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:59,427
Be careful, Steve.

1461
02:06:00,261 --> 02:06:02,013
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1462
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:15,318
You're going after him.

1463
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:16,986
You don't have to come with me.

1464
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:18,237
I know.

1465
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:21,365
When do we start?

1466
02:08:20,776 --> 02:08:24,405
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1467
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:26,449
Everything he knows about.

1468
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:28,868
Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1469
02:08:29,076 --> 02:08:30,870
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1470
02:08:31,078 --> 02:08:32,788
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1471
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:36,626
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1472
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:41,964
What we have

1473
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:46,636
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1474
02:08:49,263 --> 02:08:52,975
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1475
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:59,607
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA's good work around the world.

1476
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:04,195
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1477
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,239
and keep them off our scent.

1478
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:08,699
What about the volunteers?

1479
02:09:08,908 --> 02:09:10,451
The dead will be buried so deep

1480
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,787
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1481
02:09:14,872 --> 02:09:16,123
And the survivors?

1482
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,752
The twins.

1483
02:09:23,339 --> 02:09:26,425
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1484
02:09:28,636 --> 02:09:30,554
It's not a world of spies anymore.

1485
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,723
Not even a world of heroes.

1486
02:09:33,724 --> 02:09:36,435
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1487
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,606
There's nothing more horrifying

1488
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,566
than a miracle.
