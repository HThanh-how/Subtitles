1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:11,929
Power over Spice is power over all

2
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,598
Enemy.

3
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,365
Down. Right.

4
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,881
They're close.

5
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,576
Do you hear that?

6
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,414
The rats are calling a worm.

7
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,756
Worms!

8
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,550
Unit, climb. Now!

9
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,855
Look for wormsign.

10
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,870
We're okay.

11
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,128
Shields!

12
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,087
No Shields!

13
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,067
I got you, rat.

14
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,424
You're not welcome here.

15
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,757
Jamis! Jamis!

16
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,093
You killed Jamis!

17
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,427
Spies!

18
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,054
Witch!

19
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,613
Stop! Stop!

20
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,909
They don't know what they're saying.

21
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,788
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

22
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,126
Mahdi!

23
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,386
I need your guidance
with the two foreigners.

24
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,723
Give them back to the desert.

25
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,727
I saw the signs.

26
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,478
Again.

27
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,859
Stilgar, your faith is
playing tricks on you.

28
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,404
The Lisan al-Gaib has not
shown his face yet!

29
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,037
He killed Jamis in a fair fight.

30
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,249
He speaks our language.

31
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,919
He will quickly learn our ways.

32
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:47,716
I'm ready to pledge my life for him.

33
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,387
The desert will handle his fate.

34
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,268
What about the woman?

35
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,464
Too spicy for the foreigner?

36
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,309
He'll look pretty with blue eyes.

37
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,394
Don't mock him.

38
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,523
He deserves our respect.
He's a good fighter.

39
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,492
To the well, our water we return.

40
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,913
We bless our brother, Jamis.

41
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,006
Amen.

42
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,296
She'll drink worm piss.

43
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,714
Not funny.

44
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,382
He's about to lose her.

45
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,343
If she's stupid enough to drink poison.

46
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,471
Shut up!

47
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:34,057
We are praying.

48
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,916
Here is the Water of Life.

49
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,835
It frees the soul.

50
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,213
If you drink...

51
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,590
you shall die.

52
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,054
If you drink...

53
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,224
you may see.

54
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,892
Drink!

55
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,936
What have we done?

56
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:45,522
She is pregnant.

57
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,038
That was no miracle!

58
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,998
You saw it with your own eyes!

59
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:09,296
The Mother of the Lisan al-Gaib
shall survive the Holy Poison.

60
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,756
And She did.

61
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,591
As written!

62
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,470
Her people wrote that!

63
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,305
Blasphemy.

64
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,098
The prophecy has been accomplished.

65
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,893
The Mahdi must be Fremen!

66
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,441
Arrakis must be freed
by its own people!

67
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,927
I'm here to learn your ways.

68
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:13,986
The Mahdi is too humble
to say He is the Mahdi.

69
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,239
Even more reason to know He is!

70
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:21,034
As written!

71
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,076
Kwisatz Haderach, show us the way.

72
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,308
You will see!

73
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,645
The beauty and the horror!

74
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,687
He doesn't know how to cross.

75
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,481
Stilgar is going to get him killed.

76
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,859
What is he trying to prove?

77
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,153
What do you think?

78
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,199
"The Prophet shall know
the ways of the desert."

79
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,499
I think it's for the best.

80
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:17,794
What's this?

81
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,215
You care for him now?

82
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,468
He's not like the other strangers.

83
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,012
He's sincere.

84
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,338
You saw what he did.

85
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:25,676
He saw it coming,
and he saved her life.

86
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,178
He saw it.

87
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,097
He can foresee.

88
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,560
Muad'Dib likes his smell.

89
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,331
Then I'll die.

90
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:38,999
Maybe you will too.

91
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,003
But the others will keep going.

92
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,965
And they won't stop
until the Fremen are free.

93
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,888
He deserves to be Fedaykin.

94
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,433
He needs names, Stilgar.

95
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:57,851
He does!

96
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,608
Like Usul.

97
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,277
The base of the pillar.

98
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,977
Don't embarrass us!

99
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,729
Call a big one!

100
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:49,234
Don't worry.

101
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,320
Stilgar taught him well.

102
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,618
Enough joking.

103
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,244
This is the final test.

104
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,108
Not that big.

105
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:19,773
As written.

106
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,940
Reverend Mother!

107
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:09,323
Muad'Dib made peace with Shai-Hulud.

108
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,785
He called a grandfather worm.

109
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:17,414
The biggest ever seen.

110
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,541
As written!

111
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:23,170
Shai-Hulud shall bow
to the Boy from the Outer World.

112
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,589
Bless the Maker and His works.

113
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,469
Will not Shai-Hulud know the Mahdi
when He comes?

114
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,100
Then share the Word.

115
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,944
Will you always be with me?

116
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,941
Reverend Mother!

117
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,443
Your palanquin is ready!

118
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,399
Reverend Mother, we have to go!

119
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,874
They're the Guardians of the South.

120
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:15,128
It's a hard crossing,
but Shai-Hulud is strong.

121
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,695
The rats are travelling fast.

122
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,740
Move!

123
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:59,963
Under our glorious black sun,
we welcome to these special festivities

124
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,219
our beloved leader
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

125
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:21,360
His presence today, watching over
a spectacle of blood and honor,

126
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:28,825
marks the Holy Birthday
of our beloved na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

127
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:22,856
In celebration of our
na-Baron Feyd-Rautha,

128
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:25,692
we present a special treat.

129
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:36,620
The last three specimens
of House Atreides.

130
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,086
All hail na-Baron Feyd-Rautha!

131
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,630
The new Planetary
Governor of Arrakis!

132
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:41,413
What do you think of the outsider?

133
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:45,167
I think he's trouble.

134
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:49,671
No, I trust Usul.

135
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:16,290
Only one at a time...

136
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:20,127
or they fight each other to death.

137
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:23,380
How old?

138
01:39:23,755 --> 01:39:24,798
Very young.

139
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:31,513
My daughter asks, how is it done?

140
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:23,792
The Water of Life.

141
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:38,140
You question the prophecy?

142
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:40,517
No man will survive.

143
01:45:01,552 --> 01:45:03,720
They're all dead!

144
01:45:04,429 --> 01:45:06,390
I lost them all in the fire!

145
01:45:12,354 --> 01:45:14,773
The whole of the North has been hit.

146
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,781
There is a call for a war council
in the South.

147
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:25,325
Every leader must attend.

148
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:29,454
Muad'Dib, they're waiting for you.

149
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:53,121
None of these people
will leave without you.

150
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:56,124
I can't go South.

151
01:51:56,967 --> 01:51:59,595
You're not allowed in here, stranger.

152
01:51:59,845 --> 01:52:01,889
Leave or die.

153
01:52:03,307 --> 01:52:06,018
I should be welcomed...

154
01:52:09,938 --> 01:52:13,984
If you drink, you shall die.

155
01:52:14,735 --> 01:52:18,822
If you drink, you may see.

156
01:53:53,917 --> 01:53:55,627
Who knows about this?

157
01:53:55,627 --> 01:53:57,045
Only you, Reverend Mother.

158
01:53:57,171 --> 01:53:58,130
Good.

159
01:53:58,630 --> 01:53:59,882
Where are the others?

160
01:54:00,132 --> 01:54:01,967
They just arrived from the North.

161
01:55:12,287 --> 01:55:14,331
Because He is the One.

162
01:55:14,581 --> 01:55:19,253
The Lisan al-Gaib should find His way
to where no man has ever been.

163
01:55:19,503 --> 01:55:20,921
You're insane!

164
01:55:52,452 --> 01:55:58,876
He shall come back from the dead
with Desert Spring tears.

165
01:56:01,545 --> 01:56:04,047
Bring me a drop of Water of Life.

166
01:56:04,047 --> 01:56:05,674
As written.

167
02:03:00,839 --> 02:03:03,800
Do you smash a knife
before battle?

168
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:20,692
There is no one in this room
who can stand against me!

169
02:03:32,746 --> 02:03:36,542
Your mothers warned you
about my coming!

170
02:03:37,876 --> 02:03:40,003
Fear the moment.

171
02:03:54,476 --> 02:03:57,396
But you're afraid.

172
02:03:57,813 --> 02:04:00,274
What if I could be the One?

173
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:05,487
This could be the moment you've been
praying for, all your life.

174
02:04:08,156 --> 02:04:12,202
You're praying now,
to your grandmother.

175
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:16,415
She died nine moons ago.

176
02:04:18,792 --> 02:04:20,460
She lost an eye.

177
02:04:20,794 --> 02:04:24,590
A rock smashed her face
as she was crossing the Belt.

178
02:04:25,424 --> 02:04:28,135
She was 12 when it happened.

179
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:33,265
At that time, this world
had a Fremen name.

180
02:04:48,322 --> 02:04:52,826
In your nightmares,
you give water to the dead,

181
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:54,912
and it brings joy to your heart!

182
02:05:04,129 --> 02:05:06,673
Mahdi, what do you foresee for us?

183
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:10,677
Green Paradise.

184
02:05:12,012 --> 02:05:16,558
Lisan al-Gaib, show us the Way!

185
02:05:40,707 --> 02:05:42,918
The Hand of God be my witness!

186
02:05:43,418 --> 02:05:45,879
