00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,511
Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan,
Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI present

2
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:22,732
THE WIND RISES

3
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>The wind is rising!
We must try to live.</i>

4
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,634
Here it is.

5
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,850
May I borrow it?

6
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,686
- It's in English.
- I have a dictionary.

7
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,355
- Very good. Give it a go.
- Thank you.

8
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,043
- Knock it off.
- Butt out!

9
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,711
Better get going.

10
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,546
Jiro...

11
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,174
No more bullying, okay?

12
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,360
You look quite the hero.

13
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,738
I slipped and fell.

14
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,241
- Fighting is never justified.
- I know.

15
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,495
Go have your snack.

16
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,246
Thank you.

17
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,417
Big brother, you're back!

18
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,881
I was waiting for you.
Let's pick bamboo grass.

19
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,884
Big brother!

20
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,431
I want to pick bamboo grass.

21
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,605
You promised to go with me.

22
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,981
I've got homework.

23
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,198
That's not homework.

24
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,741
It's an English magazine.

25
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,746
What a stupid moustache.

26
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,791
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

27
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,629
His name is Caproni.
It says he's a count.

28
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,924
- Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone.

29
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,760
I better put some iodine on it.

30
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,804
Would you be quiet?

31
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,984
Big brother, what are you doing?

32
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,819
You're not allowed up here.

33
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,487
You're not wearing glasses.

34
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,992
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

35
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,663
- Mother will scold you.
- A shooting star!

36
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,749
There's another one.

37
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:42,337
They're pretty.
See? Like that.

38
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,841
There's so many of them.

39
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,047
I'm a Japanese boy.

40
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,347
I think this is my dream.

41
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,407
This is my dream, you know.

42
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,326
It's mine too.

43
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,911
Your dream?

44
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:00,582
Listen, Japanese boy.
You think we are sharing this dream?

45
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,917
It's strange.

46
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:06,421
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

47
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:12,094
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

48
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,096
Welcome to my kingdom.

49
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,764
I'm honored.

50
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,767
Look at them.

51
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,026
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

52
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,286
But the war will soon be over.

53
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,130
Climb up, Japanese boy.

54
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,845
This is my dream.
When the war is over, I will build this.

55
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,765
Magnificent, isn't she?

56
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,809
Let's fly.

57
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,566
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

58
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,494
Of course we can't climb up here...

59
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,664
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

60
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,884
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

61
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,182
Take a look.

62
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:19,221
- She's beautiful, no?
- Yes, incredible.

63
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,479
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

64
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,733
Mr. Caproni?
I have a question.

65
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,238
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

66
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,743
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

67
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,414
Listen, Japanese boy.

68
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,917
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

69
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,921
To fly airplanes is simple.

70
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,676
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

71
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,219
Yes!

72
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,596
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

73
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:06,101
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

74
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,770
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

75
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,065
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

76
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,567
Yes!

77
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,695
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

78
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,962
Jiro, you should go to bed.

79
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,801
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

80
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,305
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

81
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,308
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

82
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,061
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

83
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,606
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

84
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,970
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

85
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,180
Pardon me.

86
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,431
Please.

87
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,719
The wind feels wonderful.

88
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,639
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

89
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,890
Don't worry, Kinu.

90
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,900
Watch out!

91
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,238
Are you all right?

92
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,031
Safe!

93
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,866
Nice play.

94
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,952
Thank you.

95
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,246
"Le vent se lève."

96
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,083
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

97
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:03,236
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

98
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,616
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

99
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,128
Earthquake.

100
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,391
The boiler's going to blow!

101
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,361
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

102
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,696
Show me.

103
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,032
It hurts.

104
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,492
Kinu, be brave.

105
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,287
It's broken.
She can't walk like this.

106
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,540
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself.

107
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,208
That's nonsense.

108
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,879
Nothing's going to explode.

109
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,382
My suitcase.

110
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,099
Now, try to relax.

111
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,899
She can't walk.
Where do you live?

112
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,568
- In Ueno.
- I'll get you there.

113
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,249
- Fire.
- Let's go.

114
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,351
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

115
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,292
I'm so sorry.

116
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,794
Hang on!

117
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,347
We'd better hurry.

118
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,519
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

119
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,187
You must be thirsty.

120
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,153
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

121
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,404
Thank you.

122
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,537
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

123
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

124
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,417
I'll bring someone from home.

125
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,753
I'll go with you.

126
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,714
- Look after this, Kinu.
- I will.

127
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,133
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry.

128
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,510
Watch my suitcase.

129
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,678
- Thank you.
- I'll leave her to you.

130
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,680
But what's your name?

131
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,021
That was some guy.
Don't you think, Kinu?

132
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,666
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

133
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,376
How bad is it, Honjo?

134
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,046
The whole east side is burning.

135
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,467
That's everything we could carry.

136
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,010
Got a smoke?

137
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,519
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

138
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,354
Tokyo's finished.

139
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,873
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

140
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,477
Stop the camera!

141
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,280
The wind's shifting.
It's coming this way.

142
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:14,245
Is the wind still rising,
Japanese boy?

143
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,290
Yes, it's a gale.

144
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,419
Then you must live.
"Le vent se lève."

145
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,963
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

146
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,358
Hey Jiro. Ready?

147
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,113
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

148
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,366
The streets are wider.

149
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,743
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

150
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,372
Welcome!

151
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,920
Mackerel again?

152
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,546
It's great.

153
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,549
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

154
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,718
Can I get an egg?

155
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,055
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

156
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,683
Try the pork sometime.

157
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,686
We're more than ten years behind.

158
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,063
What?

159
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,606
Beautiful, isn't it?

160
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,567
Look at that wonderful curve.

161
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,612
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

162
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,241
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

163
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,422
Jiro sure is working hard.

164
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,257
Fish bones.

165
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,968
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

166
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,136
Jiro!

167
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,555
Honjo, listen to this.

168
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,934
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

169
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,769
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

170
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,063
Jiro, package for you.

171
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,901
A lady brought this for you, sir.

172
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,321
You were out,
so she left it with me.

173
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,948
I see. Thank you.

174
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,119
Present from your sweetheart?

175
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:03,122
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

176
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,557
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

177
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,376
- Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Back from school.

178
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,671
Your guest is waiting.
A young lady.

179
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,507
Oh, right.

180
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,559
Honestly, where were you?

181
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,062
Kayo, I'm sorry.

182
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,314
I completely forgot.

183
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,690
Really!

184
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,402
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.

185
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,071
- Is she staying there?
- Just for one night.

186
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,826
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

187
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:26,330
You're so mean.
You never ever come home.

188
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,670
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

189
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:37,216
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

190
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,929
She must really like you.

191
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,723
Come on, it's been two years.

192
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,560
Didn't you try to see her again?

193
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,271
Of course.
I went back once.

194
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:05,077
The fire stopped at her street.

195
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,662
See? There's the dock.

196
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,093
Are you cold?

197
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:25,306
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

198
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,271
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

199
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,649
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

200
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,653
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

201
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,822
- With an airplane company?
- Yes.

202
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,824
Men have it so good.

203
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,578
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

204
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,081
A doctor? I think
you might be a good one.

205
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,083
I think so too.

206
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,961
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

207
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,464
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

208
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,864
Jiro!

209
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,535
There you are.

210
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,078
- You made it.
- Finally.

211
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,747
- We're on our way.
- Yes, we are.

212
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,394
They must've been
heading for the city.

213
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,062
There were hundreds of them.

214
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,189
There's no work in the countryside.

215
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,947
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

216
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,580
- Are those the customers?
- Looks like it.

217
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,082
There were rumors.

218
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,087
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

219
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,896
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

220
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,568
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

221
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,404
I was told to come
anytime in April.

222
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,282
Then you should've come in March!

223
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,243
I've got an assignment for you.

224
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,289
It's the design for the wing strut fitting.

225
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,793
I need it right away.
We're behind schedule already.

226
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:46,965
In here.

227
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,637
The data's ready.
This way.

228
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,313
This is your desk.

229
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,817
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

230
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,194
Data here, hat goes there.

231
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,781
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

232
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,785
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

233
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,120
Introduce yourself.

234
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,163
Jiro Horikoshi.

235
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,332
Now get to work.

236
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,389
Jiro, come on.

237
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,267
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

238
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:08,023
- The assembly plant?
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

239
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:13,779
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

240
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,155
Two.

241
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,951
Excuse me.
Could we ask a favor?

242
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,620
Look, it's really coming along.

243
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,832
Sorry to bother you on your break.

244
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:28,961
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

245
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,589
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

246
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,091
I knew it.

247
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:38,136
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

248
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,848
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

249
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,184
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

250
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,311
I need your opinion.

251
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,611
- What do you think?
- Looks strong enough.

252
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,990
This is no good.
It's just like my design.

253
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,867
Then it must be bad.

254
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,202
Foreman, lunch break's over.

255
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,829
Quiet.

256
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,165
Fascinating! Aircraft are fascinating!

257
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,376
Maybe they are, but we're late.

258
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,887
I'm Hattori.

259
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,059
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

260
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,895
Is this his first assignment?

261
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,397
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

262
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,567
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

263
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:37,821
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

264
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,908
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

265
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:45,245
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

266
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:49,082
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

267
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,085
You're right.
I haven't done the calculations yet.

268
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:56,256
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

269
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,591
It's finished.

270
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,099
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

271
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,685
It's perfect.

272
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,064
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

273
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,111
- I'm heading out.
- Me too.

274
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,948
What about Kurokawa's homework?

275
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,282
Just finishing up.

276
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,455
Oxen!

277
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,874
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

278
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,462
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

279
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,297
But they're wonderful creatures.

280
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,905
Here she comes.

281
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,033
Get ready!

282
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,704
Approaching the mark.

283
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,213
Damn it!

284
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,560
- Did you get it?
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

285
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,229
Too slow.
We need ten more knots.

286
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,566
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

287
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,569
Kurokawa!

288
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,405
Representatives from the Army.

289
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,115
An audacious design.

290
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,078
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

291
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,932
Power dive.
She's trying to break 200.

292
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,958
- Parachute's open.
- Go get him!

293
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:38,145
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

294
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,313
- What about the pilot?
- He's okay.

295
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,648
That's good.

296
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:46,236
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

297
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:50,365
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

298
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:55,662
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

299
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,665
I'll never forget what I saw today.

300
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,169
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

301
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,672
There won't be a Falcon Two.

302
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:09,384
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

303
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:14,389
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

304
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:19,019
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

305
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,354
No more fighters for now.

306
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,360
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

307
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,440
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

308
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,901
You're later than usual.

309
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,904
- Two slices of the usual.
- Coming up.

310
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,746
There you are.

311
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,915
Isn't anyone looking after them?

312
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:26,920
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

313
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,756
I feel bad closing the place up.

314
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,591
I see. Well, thanks.

315
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,093
Come again.

316
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,603
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

317
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,606
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

318
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,620
Go ahead, take it.

319
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,455
Come on!

320
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,973
You here, Jiro?

321
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,979
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

322
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,984
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

323
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,330
What did you expect?

324
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:47,751
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

325
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,336
Of course not.

326
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,006
Well, maybe I did.

327
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,678
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

328
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:04,893
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

329
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,021
Why is Japan so poor?

330
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:13,693
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

331
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,740
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

332
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:22,869
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

333
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,704
They're sending you too?

334
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,039
They told me today.

335
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,041
Really? That's great news.

336
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,169
Poor countries want airplanes.

337
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:34,714
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

338
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:39,219
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

339
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,678
Married?

340
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:45,225
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

341
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,060
More irony.

342
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:27,600
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

343
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,602
I don't see any oxen.

344
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,938
The airstrip's
next to the plant.

345
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,940
Everything's so big.

346
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:59,382
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

347
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,802
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

348
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,139
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

349
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,808
America, probably.
Not that they could.

350
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:13,480
Still, it's quite something.

351
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,856
Amazing.

352
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,360
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

353
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:24,491
Who cares? We need
their all-metal airframe technology.

354
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,164
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

355
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,194
Beautiful.

356
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,245
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

357
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,872
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

358
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,210
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

359
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:21,047
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

360
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,674
Honjo, let it go.

361
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:27,053
We have a license
to your technology.

362
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,433
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

363
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,397
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

364
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,234
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job...

365
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:46,573
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

366
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:50,910
Our orders were not to let
you Japanese wander around.

367
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,930
That's Dr. Junkers.

368
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,932
What an engineer.

369
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,271
You can go inside.
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

370
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,453
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

371
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,622
There's more vibration
than I expected.

372
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,875
Our bosses are getting giddy.

373
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,295
Let the Army officers sit here.

374
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,301
Just a moment.

375
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,304
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

376
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,642
Look, a corridor through the wing.

377
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,145
This is amazing.

378
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,149
It's like being inside a power plant.

379
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:11,324
Guten tag.
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

380
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,618
Please show us your work station.

381
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,620
This is the flight engineer's station.

382
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,664
This aircraft is marvelous.

383
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,502
Japanese, do not go further.

384
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,339
Of course, my friend.

385
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,509
- This is incredible.
- Yes, it's fantastic.

386
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,845
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

387
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:08,381
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

388
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,218
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

389
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:14,721
Jiro!

390
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,057
A cigarette.

391
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,393
No. We're out.

392
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,413
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

393
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,083
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

394
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:49,255
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

395
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,423
It's beautiful.

396
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,761
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

397
00:50:55,428 --> 00:51:00,266
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

398
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,604
We can't learn anything from this.

399
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,940
These are just pretty equations.

400
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:11,611
"This technology belongs to Germany."

401
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,615
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

402
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:18,451
Wood and canvas
could be as good as metal.

403
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:22,955
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

404
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,295
Let's take a walk.

405
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,465
My brain is boiling.

406
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,936
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

407
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,274
If we close the gap
in five years...

408
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,944
he'll be five more years
down the road.

409
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,280
We'll always be chasing him.

410
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:01,244
Someday we'll overtake him
and move ahead.

411
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:05,122
I wonder if we
can be the tortoise.

412
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:12,964
What?

413
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,219
Listen to that.

414
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:27,144
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
It's perfect for us.

415
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,838
- What was that about?
- We saw him in the hangar.

416
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,398
<i>Jiro?</i>

417
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,402
I'm done. Go have a bath.

418
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,575
Dead to the world...

419
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:09,080
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

420
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,585
There's a telegram from headquarters.

421
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,462
- Come in.
- Not necessary.

422
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:20,758
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

423
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,261
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

424
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,264
- West?
- They want him to see the world.

425
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,933
All by himself?

426
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:56,794
Mr. Caproni.

427
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,088
Is the wind still rising?

428
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,674
Yes, it is.

429
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:06,470
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

430
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,472
You're retiring?

431
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,809
It's a big jump.

432
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,314
Jump!

433
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,410
Hurry. We're taking off.

434
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,414
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

435
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,332
Hurry!

436
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,709
Let me through.

437
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,002
Up here!

438
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,013
- Full power!
- Fly! Fly!

439
00:55:56,312 --> 00:56:01,067
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

440
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,694
We're taking a private jaunt...

441
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:07,531
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

442
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,040
- What do you think?
- It's incredible.

443
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,543
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

444
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,214
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

445
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,758
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

446
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,719
Japan is poor and backward.

447
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:32,723
We could never build
something like this.

448
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,851
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

449
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:40,606
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

450
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,069
My wife and family.

451
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:50,074
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

452
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:59,416
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

453
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,418
Come.

454
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:10,261
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

455
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:24,608
Which would you choose, a world with
pyramids or one without them?

456
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,152
Pyramids?

457
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:31,115
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

458
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,953
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

459
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,121
I know.

460
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:41,625
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

461
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,628
Which world will you choose?

462
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,132
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

463
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,633
Like that?

464
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,318
Very graceful.

465
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:11,780
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

466
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,169
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

467
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,013
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

468
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:39,516
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

469
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,686
We engineers are no different.

470
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:48,025
Live your ten years to the full.

471
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,710
Jiro, we need to talk.

472
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,879
- I've got a meeting.
- Cancel it.

473
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:28,732
- This is a tall order.
- They're always tall.

474
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,402
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

475
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:33,904
Jiro?

476
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,407
- How long?
- Five years.

477
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:40,244
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

478
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:43,914
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

479
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:45,416
A plum assignment.

480
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:49,962
Well, Jiro?

481
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:02,766
What do you think?

482
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,476
Leave it to me.

483
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:05,936
Good.

484
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,105
I'd like Honjo on the team.

485
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:09,481
Bad idea.

486
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,277
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

487
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:15,779
Relax and finish your coffee.

488
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:18,282
Check, please.

489
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:21,452
We've got other plans for Honjo.

490
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,000
Damn these Japanese engines!

491
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,846
And damn this short flight deck.

492
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,186
Fresh uniforms!

493
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,230
Oh, thanks.

494
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,868
Thanks for your help.

495
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,203
Those jerseys suit you.

496
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,065
Close the flight deck!

497
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,286
Stop!

498
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,849
We did it!

499
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,685
She's airborne!

500
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,918
Father!

501
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,343
Bravo! Nice catch.

502
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,141
That was kind of you.
Are you all right?

503
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,810
I'm fine. Here you are.

504
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:22,979
Thank you.
It belongs to the hotel.

505
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:24,481
Well, goodbye.

506
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:40,997
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

507
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,333
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

508
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,545
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

509
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,836
What is it?

510
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:36,840
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

511
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,010
He seems to be here by himself.

512
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,291
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

513
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:59,089
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

514
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,426
I asked it
to bring you here, to me.

515
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:11,476
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

516
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,981
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

517
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,317
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

518
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,486
Oh, now I remember.

519
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:24,489
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

520
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,325
Jiro Horikoshi.

521
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,849
Are you all right?

522
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,350
I'm fine.

523
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:58,690
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

524
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,444
She cried for joy
when we found you.

525
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:06,031
You were our knight
in shining armor.

526
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,198
Your knight?

527
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,702
You were like a knight on a
white horse that day.

528
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,538
This umbrella sure does leak.

529
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,206
It's all right.

530
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,208
I've got to tell Kinu.

531
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,712
She just had her second child.

532
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:22,839
It's such a cute baby.

533
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,553
Your painting is all wet.

534
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,723
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

535
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,059
Look, it's clearing up.

536
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,734
The rain stopped here.

537
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,571
Oh, look at that.

538
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,082
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

539
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,584
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

540
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,255
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

541
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,095
There's my father.

542
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,597
Father!

543
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:16,101
Come, I'll introduce you.

544
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,271
You're soaking wet.

545
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:25,443
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

546
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:26,945
Jiro Horikoshi.

547
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:31,574
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

548
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,830
May I sit here?

549
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,833
Certainly.

550
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,937
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

551
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:48,193
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

552
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,947
You visit Germany, yes? To Dessau.

553
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,451
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

554
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,870
You are an engineer.

555
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:03,208
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

556
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:07,212
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

557
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,216
You're exactly right.

558
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,512
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

559
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:22,227
He fights the government.
He will blow up.

560
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,729
Mr. Hitler's government?

561
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:28,233
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

562
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,069
This is a good place.

563
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:35,740
No mosquitoes.
Not hot. Good watercress.

564
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,701
A good place to forget bad things.

565
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,246
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

566
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,580
Thank you.

567
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:52,257
It is a nice night.
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

568
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,467
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

569
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,262
A good place for forgetting.

570
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,598
Make a war in China. Forget it.

571
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,851
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

572
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:07,272
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

573
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:10,108
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

574
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,777
Japan will blow up.

575
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,780
Germany will blow up too.

576
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,451
- Will Germany go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

577
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,664
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

578
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,292
Nahoko has a fever.

579
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,461
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

580
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,465
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

581
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,802
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

582
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,421
"Who has seen the wind?"

583
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,590
"Neither I nor you."

584
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:44,762
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

585
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,603
Let the wind carry...

586
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,815
these wings to you.

587
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,352
Jiro?

588
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:34,812
Nahoko!

589
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,667
Be careful!

590
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:57,705
Nice catch.

591
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:14,532
Bravo!

592
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:17,368
Is the young lady feeling better?

593
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,870
Yes, she's much better.

594
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,372
Congratulations.

595
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:25,209
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

596
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:27,378
I think you're right.

597
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:32,216
At first, this young man
was very gloomy.

598
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,385
Now he is very happy.

599
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,595
He has fallen in love.

600
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,556
That's true.

601
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:42,560
Summer love is soon forgotten.

602
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:46,397
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

603
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,566
Not me.

604
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:53,404
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

605
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,740
Yes, it's Nahoko.

606
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,119
Please give us your permission.

607
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:02,747
But...

608
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:04,081
Father!

609
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,169
I would like to accept.

610
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,421
What a beauty.

611
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,761
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

612
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:17,887
Yes?

613
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:22,099
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

614
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,102
I contracted it too.

615
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,857
I've loved you since
that day you rescued my hat.

616
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,278
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

617
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,781
Please marry me.

618
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:37,907
I will.

619
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:42,119
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

620
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,122
Even if it takes
a hundred years.

621
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,291
Congratulations.

622
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:52,046
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

623
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,008
This is a good summer.

624
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,325
- Jiro, over here!
- Honjo!

625
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,661
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

626
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,329
Hot, isn't it?

627
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,000
Come take a look.

628
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,173
She's beautiful.

629
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:38,342
Good clean lines.

630
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:45,850
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

631
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,186
But we won't know
until she flies.

632
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:53,190
She'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

633
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,215
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

634
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,051
My plane was just a tin duckling.

635
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,887
I have an idea for you.

636
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,556
I haven't tried it yet.

637
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,895
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

638
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,730
They'll reduce drag.

639
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:37,401
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

640
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,409
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

641
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:49,330
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

642
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,581
You should use it.

643
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,250
Thanks, but not this time.

644
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,712
I'll keep the plans.

645
01:26:56,879 --> 01:27:00,090
After you use it,
I'll use it too.

646
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,259
Okay.

647
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,887
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

648
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,765
Jiro! Are you here?

649
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,768
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

650
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,102
It's an emergency.

651
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,437
See you.

652
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,439
Visit the house next time.

653
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,274
Jiro, you pedal.

654
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,949
The Special Police
are looking for you.

655
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,285
The thought crime boys.

656
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:30,120
Why me?

657
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,456
I told them you were
away on business.

658
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:46,637
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

659
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,473
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

660
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,476
What's going on?
Why are they after me?

661
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:57,982
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

662
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,484
Come in.

663
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,986
Here's your stuff.

664
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:05,823
Sorry for the bother.

665
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:07,491
Need anything else?

666
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,494
- Just leave it and go.
- Jiro, it's here!

667
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,496
The prototype flange.

668
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,341
It looks great.

669
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,343
Wish we'd had it last year.

670
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,137
Jiro, what do you think?

671
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,516
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

672
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,853
A full metal duck.

673
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,604
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

674
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:42,192
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

675
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,944
All right, back to work.

676
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:58,542
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

677
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,047
Better lie low for a few days.

678
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:05,215
We'll smooth things over.

679
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,051
I'll put you up.

680
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,179
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

681
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:12,556
Is it something sensitive?

682
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:14,224
Yes, very sensitive.

683
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,560
The police will be opening your mail.

684
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:18,145
It's from my fiancée.

685
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:21,899
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

686
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:25,402
You're engaged?

687
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,405
- Jiro's human after all.
- Splendid.

688
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,741
You think Japan's a modern country?

689
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:32,284
It's not funny.

690
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:35,913
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

691
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,290
Let them read your love letters.

692
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:41,919
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

693
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:46,924
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

694
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,426
Just keep your mind on work.

695
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:54,098
<i>I miss you terribly.
And “Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.</i>

696
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,601
<i>Why are they looking for him?</i>

697
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:15,035
<i>I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.</i>

698
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,138
Jiro, telephone for you.

699
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:35,806
Coming.

700
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,642
- The telephone is there.
- Thank you.

701
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:44,481
- Hello?
<i>- Jiro? You have a telegram.</i>

702
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,607
What?

703
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:50,154
<i>Your landlord brought it.
It came two days ago.</i>

704
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,822
Please read it.

705
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:53,157
<i>Are you sure?</i>

706
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:59,913
"Nahoko...has had
a lung...hemorrhage."

707
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:02,499
"Please come at once.
Satomi"

708
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,341
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

709
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:14,178
I understand. Thank you.

710
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,846
<i>Wait, hold on!</i>

711
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:19,683
What is it?

712
01:31:21,185 --> 01:31:23,937
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

713
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:25,522
To Tokyo?

714
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,192
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

715
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,027
Let me see.

716
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,364
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

717
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,534
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

718
01:31:38,202 --> 01:31:39,203
Jiya!

719
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,811
Darling!

720
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:39,990
I wish I could've
come sooner.

721
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,164
You'll catch it.

722
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:48,832
You're beautiful.

723
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,001
I love you.

724
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:55,172
Jiro? Through the garden?

725
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,183
Come in.

726
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:10,854
Father, Jiro came to see me.

727
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:13,523
But he has to leave right away.

728
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:18,195
- Next time I'll use the front door.
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

729
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,197
All right, I will.

730
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,532
Take care, darling.

731
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:24,201
You too.

732
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,204
Goodbye.

733
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:28,538
I'll see you out.

734
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:36,880
The last train?
You'd better hurry.

735
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:42,552
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

736
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:46,056
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

737
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,891
Now you'd better go.

738
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:56,900
He's gone.

739
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:59,903
Are you crying, dear?

740
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:07,244
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

741
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:10,914
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

742
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,417
I want to get better.

743
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,752
I want a life with Jiro.

744
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:24,428
You're just in time.
The board is waiting.

745
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:33,186
So, are you ready?

746
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,689
I'll do my best.

747
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:38,608
Now the Navy.
They're the client.

748
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,204
I'll do my best.

749
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,957
- You weren't even listening.
- Right.

750
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,628
So I gave up on that idea.

751
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,801
- Everyone's here rather late.
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

752
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:10,307
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

753
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:13,477
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

754
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:16,146
We'll need it for 270 knots.

755
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,608
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

756
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:22,360
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

757
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,322
We're designing for the future.

758
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,492
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

759
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:33,163
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

760
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,666
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

761
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,018
We can do it!

762
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,395
When do we start?

763
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:00,398
But then weight becomes a problem.

764
01:37:03,527 --> 01:37:06,530
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

765
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,039
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

766
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,209
This is delightful.
Lucid and logical.

767
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:20,794
Almost had it.

768
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:23,338
Our engines are underpowered.

769
01:37:23,463 --> 01:37:26,550
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

770
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:30,887
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

771
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:33,723
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

772
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,059
like nothing the world's ever seen.

773
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,228
I have a question!

774
01:37:38,562 --> 01:37:40,063
Mr. Hirayama, please.

775
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:44,234
Mr. Hirayama is our production engineer.

776
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:45,527
Thank you.

777
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,740
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

778
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:57,038
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

779
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:58,582
What's he talking about?

780
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,542
A way to cut drag.

781
01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:06,131
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

782
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:08,592
- Question!
- I have a question!

783
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,430
I must say, that was interesting.

784
01:38:13,597 --> 01:38:15,098
It was inspiring.

785
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:37,454
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

786
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,456
Thank you.

787
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:00,537
Phone call, Chief.

788
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,832
- I'll call back.
- I think it's an emergency.

789
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,210
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

790
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,379
What?!

791
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,287
Jiro! Jiro!

792
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:28,124
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

793
01:41:29,918 --> 01:41:32,629
I'm here now. Can you walk?

794
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:34,964
Let's go.

795
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,308
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

796
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:46,309
Don't go.

797
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:51,815
We should be together.

798
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:07,163
- What a charming companion.
- My name is Nahoko.

799
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,999
- So you're Nahoko.
- Jiro, is that you?

800
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,335
We've come to you
with a request.

801
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,338
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

802
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:17,173
We've got plenty of room...

803
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,512
but I can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together.

804
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:24,681
We'll get married right away.

805
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:27,767
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

806
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,352
Here? Tonight?

807
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:31,521
It sounds lovely, dear.

808
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:35,024
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

809
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:39,529
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

810
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:41,030
Please help us.

811
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:46,703
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

812
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,705
Come with me, Nahoko.

813
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:57,380
Don't worry, he's always like that.

814
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:06,222
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

815
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:11,561
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

816
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:15,064
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

817
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:19,319
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

818
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:21,738
I see.

819
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:25,074
All right.
We'll have a real ceremony!

820
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:51,100
Here they come.

821
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,603
She's coming!

822
01:44:12,956 --> 01:44:18,127
Hear me! This lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved.

823
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:23,800
She's given up everything
in the world for him. What say you?

824
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,303
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

825
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,639
without a home
of his own.

826
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:33,142
If that's...uh, okay with you,
please come in.

827
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:36,813
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

828
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:00,837
You look beautiful.

829
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,542
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

830
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:44,881
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

831
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:47,550
We will never forget our debt to you.

832
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:55,391
Come now, we're delighted that
Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

833
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:56,559
Aren't we, dear?

834
01:45:56,726 --> 01:46:00,897
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

835
01:46:16,913 --> 01:46:18,081
You must be tired.

836
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:22,585
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

837
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:25,046
Better get some rest.

838
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:27,173
Come here.

839
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,925
But your condition...

840
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:32,261
Come.

841
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:16,639
Do you always
get home this late?

842
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:18,349
Kayo, I completely forgot.

843
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:20,601
You're so insensitive.

844
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:24,939
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

845
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:27,942
Congratulations on your marriage.

846
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:31,779
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

847
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:33,281
Are they still up?

848
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:34,949
They've gone to bed.

849
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:37,285
- Did you meet Nahoko?
- Yes.

850
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:46,127
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

851
01:47:46,586 --> 01:47:50,089
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

852
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:53,134
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

853
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:58,973
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

854
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:03,978
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

855
01:48:04,103 --> 01:48:06,272
How can you do this to her?

856
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:13,154
Does she really have to stay here?

857
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:14,322
Yes.

858
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:19,660
Each day is very precious to us now.

859
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:25,166
Get some rest.
I'm glad you came to visit.

860
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:41,682
I'm home.

861
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:44,018
- I was waiting.
- You should sleep.

862
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:53,527
- Should you be up?
- Kayo came today.

863
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,530
We're already best friends.

864
01:48:57,657 --> 01:49:01,535
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

865
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:06,040
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

866
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:12,213
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

867
01:49:12,672 --> 01:49:14,590
Look, they're so warm.

868
01:49:15,675 --> 01:49:16,801
Too bright?

869
01:49:17,677 --> 01:49:18,803
It's all right.

870
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:23,391
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

871
01:49:23,683 --> 01:49:24,892
For your mackerel bones?

872
01:49:25,518 --> 01:49:26,727
You remembered.

873
01:49:27,645 --> 01:49:30,398
I think it could
be a little lighter.

874
01:49:32,692 --> 01:49:34,443
Come a little closer.

875
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:45,413
Give me your hand.

876
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:52,920
I like to look at you
while you work.

877
01:49:53,546 --> 01:49:58,259
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

878
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:02,430
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

879
01:50:02,722 --> 01:50:04,432
Really? That's good.

880
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:06,767
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

881
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:08,394
That's too much.

882
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:11,397
Half a pound is enough for two.

883
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:16,110
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

884
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:24,285
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

885
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:27,621
- You won't let go?
- No, I won't.

886
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:33,461
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

887
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:36,130
No. Smoke it here.

888
01:50:36,422 --> 01:50:38,632
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

889
01:50:58,110 --> 01:50:59,653
Hey, Honjo.

890
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:01,322
Can I take a look?

891
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:04,533
- Sure. How's your bomber?
- Coming along fine.

892
01:51:04,784 --> 01:51:08,829
This is avant garde.
You went all the way.

893
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:14,335
So this is flush riveting.

894
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,171
Feels pretty rough.

895
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,007
We're still learning the technique.

896
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:25,179
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

897
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:31,977
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

898
01:51:34,313 --> 01:51:39,527
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

899
01:51:39,652 --> 01:51:41,362
Sure. Why not?

900
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:42,696
A redesign?

901
01:51:42,822 --> 01:51:47,034
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

902
01:51:47,493 --> 01:51:48,869
And leave the wings alone?

903
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:52,248
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

904
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:56,544
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

905
01:51:56,669 --> 01:52:00,673
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

906
01:52:02,675 --> 01:52:06,554
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

907
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:09,557
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

908
01:52:22,778 --> 01:52:24,572
Who are they going to fight?

909
01:52:24,697 --> 01:52:28,742
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

910
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:30,244
Japan will blow up.

911
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:35,082
We're not arms merchants.
We just want to build good aircraft.

912
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:36,083
You're right.

913
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:38,085
See you. Get some sleep.

914
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,129
Sure. You too.

915
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,756
I'm leaving now.

916
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:44,258
Good night.

917
01:52:44,884 --> 01:52:45,801
Night.

918
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:12,620
Welcome home.

919
01:53:13,078 --> 01:53:16,123
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

920
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:19,460
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

921
01:53:20,336 --> 01:53:23,005
She's on her way to the field.

922
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:25,799
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

923
01:53:26,759 --> 01:53:28,469
You must be tired.

924
01:53:30,763 --> 01:53:32,264
A little.

925
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:34,475
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

926
01:53:34,934 --> 01:53:37,269
Yes, she'll fly.

927
01:53:38,521 --> 01:53:40,856
I couldn't have done it without you.

928
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:43,317
I love you, Jiro.

929
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:45,486
Nahoko...

930
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:39,873
I'm off.

931
01:54:39,999 --> 01:54:41,375
Good luck.

932
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:09,612
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

933
01:55:10,154 --> 01:55:14,908
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

934
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:17,911
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

935
01:55:19,038 --> 01:55:23,250
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

936
01:55:23,751 --> 01:55:25,919
All right. Enjoy yourself.

937
01:55:26,045 --> 01:55:28,756
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

938
01:55:29,048 --> 01:55:30,924
Yes. I'll be back soon.

939
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:14,468
Please come in.

940
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:22,476
Oh, no.

941
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:34,405
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

942
01:56:40,285 --> 01:56:44,498
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

943
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,166
No! Let her go.

944
01:56:49,128 --> 01:56:52,673
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

945
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:58,011
She wants him
to remember her as she was.

946
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:48,687
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

947
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:50,898
How's her speed?

948
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:54,485
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

949
01:57:54,693 --> 01:57:55,903
How fast?

950
01:57:56,028 --> 01:57:59,239
- 240 knots.
- Two forty!

951
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:37,444
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

952
01:58:38,737 --> 01:58:40,113
Hey, Jiro.

953
01:58:40,572 --> 01:58:41,782
Jiro!

954
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:52,626
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

955
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:08,744
We meet again, Japanese boy.

956
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:11,204
Mr. Caproni...

957
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:18,045
This is where we first met.

958
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:20,547
Our kingdom of dreams.

959
02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:22,716
Or the land of the dead.

960
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,719
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

961
02:00:26,178 --> 02:00:30,140
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the full?

962
02:00:30,265 --> 02:00:33,060
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

963
02:00:33,352 --> 02:00:35,854
That's what it means to lose a war.

964
02:00:36,021 --> 02:00:38,565
There's your Zero fighter.

965
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:18,772
Beautiful. A masterful design.

966
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:21,441
Not a single plane returned.

967
02:01:21,692 --> 02:01:24,111
There was nothing
to come back to.

968
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:27,406
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

969
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:29,992
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

970
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:33,453
Someone is waiting for you.

971
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,636
Nahoko...

972
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:53,098
She's been waiting here
for a long time.

973
02:01:53,598 --> 02:01:55,976
Darling, you must live.

974
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:01,481
You must live...

975
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:25,672
She is gone.

976
02:02:27,132 --> 02:02:29,509
She was beautiful, like the wind.

977
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:32,345
Thank you.

978
02:02:33,472 --> 02:02:34,681
Thank you.

979
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:38,351
You must live.

980
02:02:38,643 --> 02:02:43,231
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.
