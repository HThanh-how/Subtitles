Dear Momo

2
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,610
Seto Inland Sea is wonderful as ever.

3
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,470
It's exactly like I described, right?

4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,740
There are so many islands.

5
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,280
Yeah.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,480
Sure brings back memories.

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,710
You weren't even born on my last visit here.

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,250
Right.

9
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,230
Maybe that one over there is Shiojima.

10
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,470
Take a look, Momo.

11
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,540
Just behind the big island.

12
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,400
You can see a glimpse of it in the distance.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,830
Yes.

14
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,420

It's exactly as I remembered!

48
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,440
It's old.

49
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,570
That's what's good about it!

50
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,410
Ikuko!

51
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,860
Mom!

52
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,510
It's been so long!

53
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,180
I'm sorry that I haven't made more frequent visits.

54
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,120
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

55
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,090
We old folks live a simple life.

56
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,480
Large items are already in place.
Take your time unpacking the rest.

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,560
I only cleaned up a bit.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,760
The movers took care of everything.

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,090
But I don't want you to work too hard.
Please leave everything to us.

61
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,980
We'll be staying with you starting today.

62
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,140
She's my daughter, Momo.

63
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,650
Momo?

64
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,010
You're such a big girl!
It's good to see you.

65
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,530
Momo.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,990
Hello.

67
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,380
Hello to you.

68
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,430
Come on right up.

69
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,000
It's your new home.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
We will. Thanks.

71
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,250
Which one is our home?

72
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,390
This one.

73
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,590
Grandpa and Grandma live next door.

74
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,020
Oh...

75
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,460
I was surprised to see such a big bridge being built here.

76
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,930
Yes, it's scheduled to open in September.

77
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,370
It'll be pretty convenient.

78
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,670
I don't know whether if it's a good thing or not.

79
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,110
I can only hope the traffic doesn't pollute the island.

80
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,740
Right... I guess so.

81
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,340
So are you feeling better now?

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,950
Oh, I'm totally fine now.

83
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,020
Don't worry about me.

84
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,520
Momo,

85
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,700
Ikuko had to live on this island when she was little, for about a year due to asthma.

86
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,430
I'm sure you've heard of it.

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,150
You said you wanted to work right away.

88
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,930
What did you do with that condo of yours?

89
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,550
I sold it.

90
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,310
I could've rent it out and made some money,

91
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,160
but I don't care anymore.

92
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,010
I see.

93
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,580
Oh well, it doesn't matter.

94
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,490
Truth be told, we were starting to feel lonely.

95
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,170
The more the merrier.

96
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,680
All our neighbors are very old.

97
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,830
It's always nice to have young people here.

98
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,900
Oh? Do I count as young, too?

99
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,460
Of course!

100
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,230
You've got mail!

101
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,170
Oh, is that you, Iku?

102
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,210
Oh, are you Kou?

103
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,010
I haven't seen you in so long!

104
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,180
I heard you were coming back, so I was looking forward to see you.

105
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Didn't know it was today, though.

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,780
What happened to being a businessman?

107
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,850
I quit ages ago!

108
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,690
It just wasn't for me.

109
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,020
I've been doing this ever since.

110
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,880
Uh...

111
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,840
She's Momo.

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,750
Kouichi!

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,230
Our neighbor's mail is mixed in again!

114
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,140
Learn to do your job!
You're always making mistakes.

115
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,540
Oops, I did it again.

116
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,270
You never change, do you?

117
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,230
Well then, I gotta get back to work.
Talk to you some other time!

118
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,210
He really didn't change at all. I can't stop laughing.

119
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,700
Oh,

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,660
it's not moving.

121
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,430
Oh, it stopped moving in early spring this year.

122
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,270
I had a watchmaker to take a look at it,
but apparently, it can't be fixed.

123
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,070
But it feels weird to have a new clock,

124
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,170
so we just kept it there.

125
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,440
Oh... early spring...

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,100
You can take it off if you don't like it.

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,910
Momo,

128
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,680
can you help me move some luggage to the <i>Sky</i> ?

129
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,940
The sky?

130
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,860
Come on up.

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,830
It's a mess, isn't it?

132
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,570
Old folks don't throw things away, you know?

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,110
Heave-ho!

134
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,510
Momo, carry that bag over here.

135
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you.

136
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,250
Oh, you have an eye for antiques.

137
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,960
Go ahead and open it.

138
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,430
Beware of Monsters Vol.1

139
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,430
Take a good look.

140
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,890
It's quite odd, though.

141
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,290
Your Grandpa's father collected these books.

142
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,090
There are many other books like it here.

143
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,540
I've been told they're illustrated storybooks from the Edo Period,

144
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,500
but this one is supposed to be especially unique.

145
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,060
You can come up and read it whenever you want.

146
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,000
Well then,

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,510
be careful on your way down.

148
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,840
What? You never told me about that!

149
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,170
Yes, I have.

150
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,630
There's Class-2 caregiver certificate training in Imabari.

151
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,450
I knew about that, but you said it's from the day after tomorrow.

152
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,580
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

153
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,860
As it turns out, the course starts tomorrow.

154
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,920
I almost got the date wrong.

155
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,380
What am I supposed to do alone, then?

156
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,660
You have to unpack, and homework too, remember?

157
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,270
They said you can hand in homework from your old school, so you can start now.

158
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,940
That's not what I meant...

159
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,680
The bath is ready. I'm unpacking shampoo and other stuff now, so you go first.

160
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,990
Dear Momo

161
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,440
Dad...

162
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,370
<i>Whatever.

163
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,330
<i>I hate you, Dad.

164
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,220
Don't even bother coming back.

165
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,600
Vienna Boy's Choir

166
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,410
So, did the research ship made it out all right?

167
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,860
Yes.

168
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,980
I-Is my husband alive?

169
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,780
Creativity

170
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,950
Dear Momo

171
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,380
Dear Momo

172
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,210
What were you going to write, Dad?

173
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's get going.

174
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
This should be enough for now.

175
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,960
Hey, don't they have bigger supermarkets here?

176
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,940
Nope, and no convenience stores either.

177
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,400
No way!

178
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,820
Everyone's waiting for you.

179
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,840
Decide already!

180
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,370
It's a bit heavy, but please carry it for me.

181
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,220
He's about your age. Let's talk to them!

182
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,130
Please, no!

183
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,980
Hey, you guys!

184
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,950
Then, your family grows tangerines too?

185
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,120
Yes.

186
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,930
I'm so glad there's another 6th grader on this island.

187
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,890
Please show her around.

188
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,520
Youta, can you let her play with you guys?

189
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,880
Y-Yes...

190
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,320
Momo.

191
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,330
Um...

192
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,830
See you.

193
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,890
Umi.

194
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,230
Please ask her to join you next time!

195
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,560
Come on!

196
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,740
To Imawari

197
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,740
Don't forget to eat the rice balls.
You can have those puddings too.

198
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,360
Can I come with?

199
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,570
I'll take you with me next time.

200
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,240
The telephone man is coming today.
Please take care of things at home.

201
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,560
Okay...

202
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,550
See you.

203
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,430
What <i>was</i> that thing?

204
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,840
<i>I'm starving to death.

205
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,300
<i>Wanna go check the kitchen?

206
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:05,280
The installation fee will be included in your next bill. Please let your family know.

207
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,950
Good-bye.

208
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,950
Thank you for coming.

209
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
Did I close it?

210
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,050
<i>Maybe there's something in that rice cooker.

211
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,060
<i>Momo is...

212
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,580
Momo!

213
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,800
Where ya goin'?

214
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,840
Roads are really narrow here, so watch out for cars!

215
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,040
What?

216
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,330
E-Excuse me!

217
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,300
Lord Michizane's Tomb

218
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,320
It was just my imagination...

219
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,530
...or was it?

220
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,520
Where am I?

221
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,670
What are you doing?

222
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,770
If you get lost on the island, just look for the sea.

223
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,530
This path extends around the island.
You'll find your way back in no time.

224
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,540
What is it?

225
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,300
Nothing.

226
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,020
Your home is that way.

227
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,980
I live that way.

228
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,740
Wanna see the straw boats?

229
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,240
No one's home.

230
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,420
My grandpa makes them,

231
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,550
but he's out somewhere.

232
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,360
Check it out. This is what it looks like when it's finished.

233
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,230
She's a beauty, isn't she?

234
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,270
It's used for a festival called Miyajima.

235
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,910
We push these off the beach, then...

236
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:12,550
Offering

237
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,710
I wonder where my grandpa went.

238
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,750
I think I'll get going.

239
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,330
My mom will be back soon, so I'll be at the pier.

240
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,650
Thanks for showing me around.

241
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,730
Miyaura!

242
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,010
We're diving off the bridge again tomorrow.

243
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,800
Come if you want!

244
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,380
Grandpa!

245
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,060
Where did you go?

246
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,120
I needed you here!

247
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,410
Huh?

248
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,370
Fine, I'll go check.

249
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,660
You're such a scaredy-cat.

250
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,740
You didn't lock the door!

251
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,030
I didn't have the time to!

252
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,350
Please go check!

253
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,080
Geez!

254
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,450
I always remind you to lock up!

255
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,860
Act your age!

256
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,850
Just go!

257
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,850
Sorry. Please!

258
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,570
Why are you screaming?!

259
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,410
S-Something just licked me!

260
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,920
Huh?

261
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,730
There's nothing there.

262
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,740
Yes, there is!

263
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,500
There isn't.

264
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,890
They really chased me!

265
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,630
I'm only telling you to make sure to lock up next time.

266
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,230
How could I eat three pudding on my own?

267
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm not mad about that.

268
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,250
I'm telling you, there's something here.

269
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,140
There isn't.

270
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,000
Is too!

271
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,700
No, there isn't.
Stop messing around!

272
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,540
What is it?

273
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,050
Hey, let's go back to Tokyo.

274
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,090
We have nowhere to stay.

275
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,930
I know, but...

276
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,290
You'll get used to the life here.
Now, eat up!

277
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,910
What's your problem?

278
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,780
You've decided coming here on your own.

279
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,120
You never ask for my opinion.

280
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,020
What? I asked, and you said okay.

281
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,900
I just said I don't mind.

282
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,700
I'm going to lose my mind if I stayed here any longer.

283
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,090
Let's go back.

284
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,510
Then go back on your own if you hate this island so much.

285
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,710
Okay, I'll go.

286
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,130
How?

287
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,560
You're such a meanie.

288
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,520
Get right up!

289
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,610
You should go if Youta asked you to come.

290
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,840
Don't forget to unpack your stuff soon.

291
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,280
Make sure to eat breakfast too.

292
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,250
I already asked Grandma to make lunch for you.

293
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,120
Go and eat with them.

294
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,640
See you!

295
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,870
Mom...!

296
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,970
<i>Ikuko is gone.

297
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,630
<i>What are you still doing here? Follow her, Mame!

298
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,710
<i>Let's go do something about our hunger!

299
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,040
<i>What's Momo doing?

300
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,210
<i>I've got no clue. She was sleeping just now.

301
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,710
<i>Whatever, I'm starving.

302
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,590
<i>Me too.

303
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,380
We came to pick you up!

304
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,810
Where's your swimsuit?

305
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,390
I'll go get changed.

306
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,630
There you have it.

307
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,500
She's one of us starting today.
Got it?

308
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,270
Got it!

309
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:26,910
Nice to meet ya!

310
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,970
Nice to meet you.

311
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm happy to see another girl in our group.

312
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,140
Nice to meet you, Miyaura.

313
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,250
Nice to meet you.

314
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,240
All right! Let's go!

315
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,680
Get ready.

316
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,810
It's a bit high, but you won't be scared after the first jump.

317
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,340
Off I go!

318
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,150
What?!

319
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,010
Watch, this is how you do it.

320
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,150
Hurry and jump, Youta!

321
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,780
Watch this!

322
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,420
Can you do it?

323
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,000
No one's forcing you to jump!

324
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm not done!

325
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,730
Are you going home, Momo?

326
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,160
Sorry.

327
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,630
<i>Man, it sucks! I hate rain and lighting!

328
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,820
<i>I'm so sick of it!

329
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:20,250
<i>Your form right now somehow doesn't look like water would be a problem, though.

330
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,070
<i>What? You must be joking!

331
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,060
That was a big one.

332
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:47,610
The rule is, we have to get our own food in this world,

333
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,780
but all we get are these green tangerines.

334
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,440
I want to eat some meat!

335
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Yup, me too.

336
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,240
Huh?

337
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,460
Oops, I sat on Momo.

338
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,640
She saw us.

339
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,210
What should we do?

340
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,230
The tangerine field was wrecked again.

341
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,100
When is the city do something about it?

342
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,460
I need them to get rid of the wild boars soon.

343
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,220
What's the matter?

344
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,140
It's yokan made from lemon grown on this island.
Help yourself.

345
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,850
My father loved to collect these when he was alive.

346
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,060
He called them "Guardians," if my memory serves me right.

347
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,950
They used to be gods,

348
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,730
but they were relegated to yokai.

349
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,660
They were gods?

350
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,450
Actually,

351
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,460
my father said he saw them.

352
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,050
He told me that it's a secret when I was little.

353
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,790
They're horrifying, from what I heard.

354
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,990
Have some.

355
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,090
These are pretty good. Not too sweet.

356
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,930
I-I just met...

357
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,970
Right, then he said...

358
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,010
"I'll tell you, but you mustn't tell anyone.

359
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,950
Something bad might happen."

360
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,670
But then again...

361
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,950
I wouldn't say my father's a lier,

362
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,510
but he sure liked to exaggerate things.

363
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,920
That story's no exception.

364
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,910
Still, when I look at them,

365
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,930
I think they have funny faces, rather than scary.

366
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,900
Why didn't Mame follow Ikuko to Imabari?

367
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,940
He's asking you.

368
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,110
I missed the ship.

369
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,050
Hear that?

370
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,910
Oh!

371
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,250
He's the one in the middle.
Your great-grandfather.

372
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,690
He's always watching over us.

373
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,800
It's funny when you think he's watching.

374
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,600
It makes me want to act responsibly.

375
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,350
What... exactly should I do if I met one of those yokai?

376
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,480
They'll get you if you're feeling scared.

377
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,020
Muster up the courage and glare right back!

378
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,720
They'll think you're tough, and stay away from you.

379
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,410
They're actually cowards, according to my old man.

380
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,530
I don't know if it's true though!

381
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,590
It's not happening! I don't have the courage to glare back at them!

382
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,620
Please, don't show up again!

383
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,810
<i>I'm going to help out at the field.

384
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,770
<i>Your lunch is rice balls again, but please eat them.

385
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,120
<i>P.S. Take care of a package that will arrive this afternoon.

386
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,480
Take care of...

387
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,550
I'll be alone again.

388
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,310
Is this really going to work?

389
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,650
I have an idea.

390
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,280
When did any of your ideas <i>ever</i>  work before?

391
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,680
Go on.

392
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,440
Rice balls.

393
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Guardians my butt!
What were you planning to do with us?

394
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,280
What happened to your bright idea, huh?!

395
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,760
We are the yokai defeated by Sugawara no Michizane, the prince,

396
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,860
and sealed within the illustrated storybook.

397
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,430
Your opening the sealed box

398
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,060
has unleashed us from millennia of sleep!

399
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,670
That's what happened?

400
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,470
I thought we came down from the sky or someth...

401
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,220
My name is Iwa.

402
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,050
The skinny one here is Kawa,

403
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,020
and the tiny one is Mame.

404
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,400
As you can see, we are not suspicious in any way or form!

405
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,860
Stay away from me!

406
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,920
Stop... stop that!

407
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,290
You must not break it!

408
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,220
It's an important pass,

409
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,650
if you break it in half,

410
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,890
it would stop working!

411
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,960
Why did you just explain everything, dude!?

412
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,190
Give it back!

413
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,030
No! Please stop!

414
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,140
Get down!

415
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,470
We'll listen to anything you say.

416
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,740
Is there anything you want?

417
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,300
You can ask for anything.

418
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,940
Perhaps... this might please you?

419
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,050
That's mine.

420
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,190
Yes, it's your...

421
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,020
I-I still have other things.

422
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,190
I don't want anything! Just get out of here!

423
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,550
D-Don't do that!

424
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,630
Please, stop!

425
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,890
Okay. We will leave this house.

426
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,530
If you could give that back first...

427
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,240
Yes, Ma'am!

428
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,960
Yes, yes, yes.

429
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,710
That was one evil girl back there.

430
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,350
The pass is in her hands... this is going to be tough.

431
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,190
How can she see us anyway?

432
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,560
Is it because she's evil?

433
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,390
If I were to guess, it's because when we dropped down here,

434
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,690
we hit that Momo girl by mistake.

435
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,470
Maybe that's why she can see us.

436
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
It was so much better in the old days when we went on rampages.

437
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,680
We would just kick stupid humans out of our way.

438
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,710
Agreed.

439
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
Well, then.

440
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,080
A girl's mood swing doesn't last very long.

441
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,420
It should be safe to go back.

442
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,760
Yeah...

443
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,770
Wait, are you sure?!

444
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,530
Thank you.

445
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:49,940
I still don't think you have to force yourself to work right away.

446
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,280
Yes, but I have to support Momo until she's a grown-up.

447
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,640
If I have to work anyway, then sooner the better.

448
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,880
I have to put bread on the table and a roof over our heads.

449
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,320
Although, I'm totally depending on you right now.

450
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,150
We don't mind. We love having you here.

451
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,200
Kazuo was a good man.

452
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,770
You must miss him.

453
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,530
I don't feel that lonely now.

454
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,510
"Plow your way to the Heavens."

455
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,520
It really makes you wonder how they plowed fields near the top those mountains.

456
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,320
This island doesn't have many flatlands. We have our ancestors to thank.

457
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,590
Are you all right?

458
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,660
I choked on the tea.

459
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,650
I thought you were sick again.

460
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,710
Sorry.

461
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,880
That gave me a scare.

462
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,170
You're telling me!

463
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,450
There.

464
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,620
Gotta use the bathroom.

465
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,010
I'm using it!

466
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,200
Oh, I'm sorry!

467
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,610
What happened to our promise?

468
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,570
We can't leave this place!

469
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,790
What are you talking about?

470
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,190
<i>Goal! He scored!

471
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,360
Don't tell me...

472
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,030
We'll die if you break that thing.

473
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,570
Can you kill people?

474
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,010
You guys aren't people...

475
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,910
W-Wait!

476
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,680
Here, eat.

477
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,000
Y-You stole these?

478
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,290
Eat.

479
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,770
Fine!

480
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,740
You can stay, but don't do anything bad!

481
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,370
'kay.

482
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,240
Mom isn't home... Yokai show up...

483
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,040
What a crazy situation.

484
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,930
It was true...

485
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,670
Momo! Are you in the Sky?

486
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,180
Welcome home.

487
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,410
Thanks.

488
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,150
I bought some snacks. Let's eat them together.

489
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,310
Come down here.

490
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,640
She can't see them?

491
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,040
Umi

492
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,620
We're going to see Kazuo.

493
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,080
What?

494
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,650
My dad's gone.

495
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,480
Does he look like you?

496
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,720
I don't know.

497
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,050
Take a look at his photo on the altar.

498
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,230
Why do you ask?

499
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,960
I'm really forgetful.

500
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,590
Why did I ask?

501
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,160
Now's our chance!

502
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,020
Miyaura?

503
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:46,090
S-Sorry for leaving without saying anything.

504
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,150
Oh, don't worry about it.

505
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,090
You came here just to tell me that?

506
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,900
Momo.

507
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,670
Hi there.

508
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,850
It's my raincoat!

509
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,880
Did you find it for me?

510
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,620
Y-Yeah... Your name was on it.

511
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,690
Who are you?

512
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,600
Don't mind her.

513
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,340
She says weird stuff sometimes.

514
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,610
Cut it out, it's creepy.

515
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,610
I'm so sorry. Good-bye.

516
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,370
I'll get going.
Go visit your grandparents again today.

517
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,180
See you.

518
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,960
Bye.

519
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,640
Do I look like my dad?

520
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,520
That's great.

521
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,720
Oh, your field was wrecked again, right?

522
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,080
That's horrible.

523
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,690
Did the wild boars do it?

524
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,860
I think so.

525
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,190
You <i>think</i>?

526
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:27,000
Wild boars should've left more mess behind.

527
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,390
What else could've done it?

528
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,380
I have no clue.

529
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,580
Did you get used to the life on this island yet?

530
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,790
You can ask me anything you want!

531
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,920
Okay.

532
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,560
Did Iku go training again today?

533
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,510
Yes.

534
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,130
What is it?

535
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,950
Nothing.

536
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,100
See you then.

537
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,260
See ya!

538
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,240
I'm going first!

539
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,960
I'm next!

540
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,350
You're next, Youta! Dive head first!

541
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,090
What, again?

542
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,320
Please?

543
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,970
Come on!

544
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,390
You did it!

545
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,630
What'd you do that for?!

546
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,530
I didn't dive in...

547
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,760
You pushed me down!

548
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,230
I thought I was dead.

549
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,830
Listen...

550
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:13,850
Off you go!

551
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,770
Impressive!

552
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,010
You've got to be kidding me!

553
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,210
I told you not to steal.
Catch and eat fishes!

554
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,490
I don't like fishes.

555
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,800
They have scales and stuff.

556
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,640
Well, I'm off.

557
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,510
Oh, look at that!

558
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,080
She's pretty good.

559
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,650
You'll never see the end of it if you did it for free.

560
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,510
Ask for some allowance!

561
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,440
Have a good day.

562
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,150
Can I ask you something?

563
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:14,410
Is there anything you can eat on this island for free?

564
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,370
Are you still hungry?

565
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,600
No, it's not like that.

566
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,540
You know, something found in the nature.

567
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,570
You can find as many fishes as you need.

568
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,940
No fishes!

569
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,210
Huh?

570
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,770
Any food other than fishes.

571
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,840
Let's see...

572
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,430
You might find some in the mountains...

573
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,660
Can I really eat until I'm full?

574
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,500
Just order me a deluxe-size of whatever we're getting!

575
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,300
I haven't eaten anything for <i>three days</i> !

576
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,720
I just saw you eat!

577
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,720
Hold on!

578
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,410
Let's ride on this thing.

579
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,050
No! We'll get in trouble!

580
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,660
We'll get in <i>trouble</i> ?

581
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,060
Listen, chump!

582
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:22,630
This great guy here once ate a grown-up man in one bite!

583
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,900
See?

584
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,190
As for me, I did this...

585
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,840
...and sucked human livers from their mouths and ate them all!

586
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,700
Sure brings me back.

587
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,940
As long as you understand.

588
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,000
Let's go.

589
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,010
How far do we have to climb up?

590
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,160
Hmm... he said we'll probably have to get near the top.

591
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,520
You'd better not make us eat some stupid nuts.

592
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,730
Looks like it's made a new home.

593
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,980
Shut up!

594
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,520
You see that?

595
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,170
Our main dish!

596
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,290
Hey!

597
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,460
Wait!

598
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:53,750
Run!

599
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,640
No way...

600
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,510
Iwa! Kawa!

601
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,210
Stop!

602
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,390
They're coming!

603
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,150
Here they come!

604
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,180
That was a close call, huh? Momo.

605
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,170
You were trying to run without me!

606
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,180
It's a feast tonight!

607
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,630
I can't stop drooling.

608
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,970
You can't!

609
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,190
Don't you feel sorry for them?

610
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,150
Hey, look!

611
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,900
Don't they know when to give up?

612
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,140
Let these babies go!

613
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,310
Are you crazy?

614
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,410
But...

615
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,580
Okay!

616
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,040
Leave it to me!

617
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,100
Nice!

618
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:52,170
Sandwich? What a formidable foe!

619
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,530
We're done for!

620
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,530
I'm counting on you, Kawa!

621
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:09,020
It stinks!

622
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,130
You guys are amazing!

623
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,090
But I'm out of gas...

624
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,550
Do something, Kawa!

625
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,190
I'm out of <i>gas</i>  too!

626
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,710
We didn't even find any nuts.

627
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,920
The wild boars must have eaten them.

628
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,850
I'm starving.

629
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,640
Still, they looked so tasty.

630
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,400
Incredible!

631
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,030
You guys should take a look.

632
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,540
It's <i>really</i> beautiful!

633
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:10,370
We can't eat the scenery!

634
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,330
It's beyond repair.

635
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,350
Let's walk home.

636
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,690
What?!

637
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:16,920
I can't.

638
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,660
We're delicate, you know. Unlike you!

639
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,430
Ow! The pain!

640
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:25,000
I'm sorry, but go home on your own.

641
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,270
Well, I would, but it'd be scary when it gets dark.

642
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,350
Walk, young girl, over our corpses.

643
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,590
Well then, it's time to show what I'm truly capable of.

644
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,590
I hate hard work and fish scales.

645
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,210
I'm home!

646
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:29,870
I'm home...

647
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,020
Welcome back.

648
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,710
Oh, you're covered in mud!

649
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,570
That little girl...

650
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:46,780
Her attitude is getting worse, just because she's holding the pass...

651
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,530
Girls are scary creatures.

652
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,990
I can't take anything out of the fridge,

653
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,190
but I can get away with these if I replace them using my allowance.

654
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,280
Eat up!

655
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,740
You finally learned to make offering, huh?
Took you long enough!

656
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,280
Where did you go?

657
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,520
Bathroom.

658
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,790
Dad loved the sea.

659
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,750
Yeah.

660
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,760
Mom,

661
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,200
I don't hate this island all that much.

662
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,730
Now that I think of it,

663
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,640
we've been like this for a long time.

664
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,840
I couldn't agree more. It's an everlasting task.

665
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,400
But then again, if we actually worked...

666
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,650
Nah, it wouldn't have been any better.

667
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,550
Just so you know, we have to send our report to the Sky soon.

668
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,950
What is that?

669
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,660
At least remember <i>some</i> stuff, would ya?

670
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:38,330
Our task is to report Momo and Ikuko's life to the Sky!

671
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:45,030
I thought we were defeated by Sugawara-something,

672
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,570
and sealed in something-book for thousands of years?

673
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,870
That was a made-up story to fool the girl!

674
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,770
Unbelievable!

675
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,040
I know!

676
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,520
Mame should write the report this time,
as part of the training!

677
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,550
Umi.

678
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,550
Listen, Momo.

679
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,100
The others aren't coming today.

680
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,270
It's just me and my brother.

681
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:03,000
Would you like to come with us and dive?

682
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,110
Can't you?

683
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,310
Momo,

684
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,940
it's time for lunch!

685
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,470
Got it!

686
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,710
All right. I'll go later.

687
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,610
Okay, we'll be waiting for you on the bridge.

688
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:38,130
I don't know how to write.

689
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,420
It's so hot!

690
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,650
It sure is.

691
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,130
By the way, I've been getting reports of girls' belongings...

692
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,980
like bags and hats being stolen.

693
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,730
Looks like someone's messing with the field too.

694
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,270
Let me know if you see anything suspicious, all right?

695
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:08,270
Hey, Kouichi?

696
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,410
You listening to me?

697
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,230
What? Uh...

698
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:17,010
You're hopeless.

699
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,200
Huh?

700
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,820
It feels heavy for some reason.

701
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,560
Iku...

702
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:44,260
Poor guy, the heat's got him.

703
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,870
Mame.

704
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:49,910
Are you there?

705
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,350
"Dear Momo."

706
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,020
That little Mame, he ran away with the report half-finished.

707
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,040
I have no choice.

708
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:27,640
<s>Dear</s> Momo is well.
Ikuko is also well.

709
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,640
This is the proper usage of the Japanese language.

710
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:32,780
I'm moved by my own masterpiece.

711
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:39,320
I finished the report for you.
Let's send it.

712
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,930
Report

713
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,780
Clap!

714
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,060
What are you...

715
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,130
Hey! What's with the getup?

716
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:21,670
Quiet! This is a holy ceremony for report transmission.

717
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,500
What?

718
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,910
Would you like to join us?

719
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,680
What? No way.

720
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:32,650
Would you like to join us?

721
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,580
I said no!

722
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,300
Would you like to join us?

723
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,380
Absolutely not!

724
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:50,560
<i>Would you like to join us?

725
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,180
Ow!

726
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,170
What did you...

727
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,910
Observe!

728
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,220
This.

729
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,520
This.

730
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,150
And this.

731
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,080
Now...!

732
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,860
Report

733
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,870
Wow!

734
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,520
Where did you send it?

735
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:05,110
W-We reported our safety to Lord Michizane's soul.

736
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,810
He can never return to this world again, you know?

737
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:10,640
He must be screaming in envy right now!

738
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,420
Screaming...

739
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,090
You can send letters to the dead?

740
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,400
He can...

741
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:21,860
Really?

742
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,860
I-I don't know anything about it!

743
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,550
I want to send a letter to my dad.

744
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,570
Wait here!

745
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,660
This is a bad turn of events.

746
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,130
A letter?

747
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,120
It was on my desk.
Have you seen it?

748
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,780
Hmm...

749
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,390
N-No, I haven't seen it!

750
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,290
Really?

751
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,920
No, I haven't.

752
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,460
What about you, Mame?

753
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,810
What am I going to do?

754
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,140
Momo's taking her time.

755
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,450
Wanna go get her?

756
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,860
No.

757
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,210
Let's wait.

758
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,980
It has to be here, somewhere!

759
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:26,220
It's nowhere to be found...

760
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,550
The promise!

761
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,730
<i>The typhoon is maintaining its momentum as it advances north.

762
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:31,950
<i>Severe wind warning is expected to be issued for Southern Kyuushuu and all of Shikoku by afternoon.

763
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,320
I'm glad I don't have training today.

764
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,750
I should clean things up while I still can.

765
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,130
You haven't even touched your homework, have you?

766
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,860
It doesn't look like you can go out today anyway.
Finish it up.

767
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,560
Where's my reply?

768
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,710
Yes.

769
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,640
Dear Dad

770
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,100
Hey, did you see my hand mirror?

771
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,090
Knock the door!

772
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,270
You left it open.

773
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,760
What about the hand mirror?

774
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,270
I don't know.

775
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,120
Isn't it on the dressing table?

776
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,390
That's strange...

777
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:27,580
I don't look bad at all in this form.

778
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,730
I'm so handsome no matter what my body looks like.

779
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:33,670
I wonder if this is what they call "class?"

780
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,780
Let me see.

781
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,970
Not bad.

782
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:45,690
Our job as the Guardians is so much easier when they're in home together.

783
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,850
I couldn't agree more.

784
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:54,070
By the way, are we getting enough protein?

785
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,090
They're back.

786
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,290
I'm hungry.

787
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,250
You guys!

788
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,330
Yes?

789
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:33,230
Seriously, how many times do I have to tell you?

790
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:36,840
I told you to never steal...

791
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,740
You can't take that!

792
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:45,890
What's the big deal?
I just borrowed it for a bit.

793
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,420
Watch it!

794
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,710
That's a precious gift my dad bought for my mom!

795
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,450
Give it back!

796
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:59,900
Give it back!

797
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,690
Hey!

798
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,780
Cut it out! Stop!

799
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,210
Give it back!

800
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,820
Momo?

801
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,800
What's going on here?

802
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,940
Are you hurt?

803
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:51,860
I'm sorry, Mom.

804
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,590
The mirror broke.

805
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,520
I don't care about the mirror!

806
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:05,670
Please explain this.

807
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,730
It wasn't me.

808
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,620
I didn't take them.

809
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,080
Are you saying someone brought them here?

810
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,140
Mom...

811
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,800
Tell me the truth.

812
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,540
Momo.

813
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:27,820
You may not believe me, but...

814
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:33,550
there are yokai here, and they're hungry.

815
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,430
Momo. Don't lie.

816
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,500
I'm not lying.

817
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,740
Momo!

818
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,700
I'm not lying!

819
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,730
Where are those yokai, then?

820
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,170
They're right here.

821
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,710
No, they're not!

822
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,680
Yes, they are.

823
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,920
No, they're not!

824
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,500
Can't you see?

825
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:11,260
You've changed, Mom.

826
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,350
How so?

827
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,340
You haven't been yourself since Dad died.

828
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,110
Don't change the subject.

829
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,710
I'm not!

830
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:28,310
You don't understand me at all, Mom!

831
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,220
You're never home.

832
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:40,800
You've forgotten about Dad.

833
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,490
Wait! We're not done here!

834
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:39,270
Where were you yesterday?

835
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,010
We were waiting for you.

836
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,680
Sorry.

837
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:50,470
I actually couldn't dive off the bridge until last year.

838
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:53,290
You'll be able to jump one day.

839
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,300
It's almost time for the festival.

840
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:03,840
The straw boats I showed you the other day will be carried here by our dads, and released into the sea.

841
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,540
It's quite a sight.

842
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,880
My dad's gone.

843
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,200
Don't take it too hard.

844
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,520
It's a common family quarrel.

845
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:34,970
Don't you remember? It's all your fault.

846
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,600
I...

847
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:51,240
I had a fight with my dad right before he died.

848
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,490
When my parents went on a date for the first time,

849
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:02,090
they went to see a performance by the Vienna Boys' Choir.

850
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:10,940
I found out that the same choir was coming to Japan on the day of their wedding anniversary,

851
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:15,830
so I asked my mom to buy three tickets.

852
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:23,550
But we only made a promise to spend the day together,

853
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,840
without telling my dad about the choir.

854
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,850
I wanted it to be a surprise.

855
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:35,960
Then, on that day...

856
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,600
I'm so sorry.

857
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,160
I promise to keep my schedule open next week.

858
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,870
It has to be today.

859
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,270
It's an important research project.

860
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,530
A lot of people will be in trouble if I don't go.

861
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,640
But...

862
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,880
Please?

863
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,120
I'm begging you.

864
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,390
Okay? Hmm?

865
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,830
Whatever.

866
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,830
I hate you, Dad.

867
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:24,100
Don't even bother coming back.

868
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,670
Vienna Boy's Choir

869
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,610
Dear Momo

870
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,000
Why did I say such a terrible thing?

871
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm sorry!

872
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,600
I didn't know it was such an important letter.

873
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,360
It was sent to the Sky by mistake!

874
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:31,580
What? By "Sky," you mean...

875
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,240
Not the attic.

876
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:39,380
A greater Sky.

877
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,900
Do you think the boats will be all right?

878
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,860
Yeah.

879
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,330
Youta?

880
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:04,340
Youta... did you... see Momo?

881
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,840
I saw her by the beach earlier, but it's been a while.

882
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,220
Thank you.

883
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,850
I may have said something terrible to her.

884
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,200
What's wrong?

885
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,620
Are you all right?

886
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,950
Hang on!

887
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,710
We were quite mischievous in the past.

888
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,980
We crossed the line,

889
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,480
and the boss in the Sky finally punished us.

890
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:47,390
We lost our true forms and powers.

891
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:51,260
Nowadays, we're just lowly servants.

892
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,220
Only our appetites haven't changed.

893
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,590
We're stuck in our role.

894
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,640
What about Sugawara no Michizane?

895
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,200
It was a lie.

896
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,740
What? It was a lie?

897
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,110
Stop forgetting!

898
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,880
You have to stop too, old man.

899
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,980
It doesn't matter.

900
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:19,020
Momo, we have some ties with your father.

901
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:25,160
Dead humans wander around the ground for a while,

902
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,970
but they all eventually head to the Sky.

903
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,830
While they're moving from the ground to the Sky,

904
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:35,570
they cannot watch over their family.

905
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,620
That's when we watch after their families,

906
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,560
and report back to the Sky.

907
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,450
That's the task given to us, the Guardians.

908
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,150
Your father will reach the Sky soon.

909
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:52,390
When he can watch over you with his own eyes,

910
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,910
our task will be complete.

911
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:58,700
Believe it or not, it will happen tomorrow morning.

912
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,290
It's almost time to withdraw.

913
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:05,100
I apologize. We're not allow to say too much.

914
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,940
Hello? You've told her everything!

915
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,670
My dad is...?

916
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,380
Is that you, Momo?

917
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,650
I finally found you.

918
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:26,880
Hurry and get on the back seat!
Something terrible happened to Iku!

919
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
Momo!

920
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,310
Mom!

921
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,840
Momo!

922
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,450
Mom!

923
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:58,250
Momo. I'm glad you're safe.

924
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,560
Are you okay?
I'm sorry for making you worry.

925
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,480
Where's the doctor?

926
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:10,570
The doctor and the nurse, Mitsuko, are both on another island for a house call.

927
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:13,570
They can't come back in the typhoon.

928
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,730
What?

929
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:18,170
You're completely soaked.
Go get changed.

930
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:20,200
No, I'm fine.

931
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:25,500
We're keeping in touch with Miss Mitsuko.

932
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,150
It's no use.

933
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:37,990
They can't use boats or helicopters until the typhoon passes us by.

934
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:41,960
This is why I said we need more than one doctor on this island!

935
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,920
What should we do?

936
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:47,940
If we had a doctor or a nurse here,

937
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:52,000
they could've given her an oxygen inhalation therapy or an injection.

938
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,240
That's not very effective, and repeated use isn't good for health.

939
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:07,980
Mom!

940
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,850
Iku!

941
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:21,370
The bridge! What about that big bridge?

942
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:25,440
The construction is over, but it's not officially open yet.

943
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,570
Even if it were, it would be too dangerous in the typhoon...

944
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:48,390
What would happen to her?

945
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:52,190
A doctor will come right away, once the typhoon passes.

946
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,140
What if it doesn't?

947
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:59,060
It will, in time. Don't worry.

948
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,530
Calm down.

949
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:06,430
She must have endured it for a long time.

950
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,380
Poor girl.

951
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:12,350
She must have been very sad.

952
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,520
But she's the type who kept everything inside.

953
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,150
It must have felt all the more painful.

954
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,410
Mom was crying...

955
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,370
Please cross the bridge to Imabari with me!

956
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:38,300
I want to bring the doctor here!

957
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,640
We can't!

958
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,710
We're forbidden to get involved in personal matters!

959
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,010
Please!

960
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:47,450
Who knows what'll happen to use if we broke the rule?

961
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:50,210
I mean, do you even think we have that kind of power?

962
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,460
You said you'd do anything for me!

963
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,960
That's one thing we can't do, even if you break the pass.

964
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,670
There you have it.

965
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:02,500
We'll withdraw tomorrow morning.

966
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,470
Please leave us alone.

967
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,480
Fine, I won't ask for your help.
I'll do it on my own!

968
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:31,220
Momo?

969
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:34,360
What are you doing, Kouichi?
Stop her!

970
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,380
Kouichi!

971
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,070
Use your bike!

972
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:44,730
Catch up with us!

973
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,730
Where's my key?

974
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:05,150
<i>I didn't understand my mom's feeling at all.

975
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:19,100
You can't, Momo.

976
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,840
Please, let me go.

977
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,880
Don't be reckless! We have to get back!

978
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,120
My mom will die at this rate!

979
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,350
Don't be ridiculous!

980
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:30,550
That's not going to happen.

981
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:34,180
All right? Let's go home.

982
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:43,920
I never got to make up with my dad.

983
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:49,620
I said a terrible thing to my mom today too.

984
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:54,870
I have to go now! I have to save Mom!

985
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,170
Momo...

986
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,480
Can you help her?

987
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,450
What?

988
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:03,210
I know you can help her.

989
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:06,080
Please, help her out!

990
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,220
Youta...

991
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,880
<i>You're so assertive.

992
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,960
<i>But look at me...

993
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:35,510
Iku is an important person to me too.

994
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,650
Hop on!

995
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,090
Wish us luck, Youta!

996
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:51,640
Miyaura! Good luck!

997
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:54,770
Pass

998
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:00,230
We didn't have a choice.

999
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:05,550
There was someone who recently broke the rule.

1000
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,740
It was a sad end.

1001
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,380
Just the thought of it makes me shiver.

1002
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,950
I don't want to die.

1003
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:18,120
What would happen to us if Ikuko and Momoko died?

1004
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,540
Let's see...

1005
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:22,430
It's okay if they die from natural causes or fate.

1006
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:26,230
But otherwise, we've failed as Guardians.

1007
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,450
Heads will fall, if you know what I mean.

1008
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:31,640
One life aside, two lives...

1009
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:36,640
Wait, the reason this time is because we...

1010
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,820
Oh, I know!

1011
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:48,220
If we save Momo, then we would have functioned as Guardians,

1012
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:52,030
even if we broke the rule in the progress?

1013
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:55,120
Maybe we can avoid the punishment!

1014
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,770
I see.

1015
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:58,660
Hold on,

1016
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,800
what can we do anyway?

1017
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:08,220
Crazy fart or running insanely fast aren't going to help when we're up against a typhoon!

1018
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,600
It's hopeless.

1019
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,610
We're not alone.

1020
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:30,570
No Trespassing

1021
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,970
Okay. Let's go!

1022
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,000
Yes!

1023
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,760
Hang on tight!

1024
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:10,520
Kouichi!

1025
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,200
I'm fine.

1026
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:46,330
Damn! It's over!

1027
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,080
Mom...

1028
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,070
Dad.

1029
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:19,820
Please save Mom!

1030
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:03,700
Momo!

1031
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,800
Iwa! Kawa! Mame!

1032
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,480
You all came for me?

1033
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:11,880
Huh?

1034
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:12,880
Momo!

1035
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,340
We'll block the wind, so just break through the storm!

1036
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,900
Momo...

1037
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:37,070
The rain...

1038
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:38,750
Let's go while we can!

1039
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:40,610
This is impossible.

1040
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:42,880
Kouichi!

1041
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:54,400
What?!

1042
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,190
Run, please.

1043
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,870
It's so heavy...

1044
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:00,070
Kouichi!

1045
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,970
Iwa!

1046
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:13,120
No more thinking for me!

1047
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,920
All right!

1048
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,710
Yahoo!

1049
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,520
Amazing.

1050
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:19,400
We're in the Shikoku Region.

1051
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,410
We're almost there.

1052
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:33,080
Please wait for us!

1053
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:37,520
I hate rain. Please make it quick!

1054
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:28,420
I'm going back home for a bit, but I'll be back right away.

1055
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:53,530
Great! I made it in time!

1056
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:56,120
Thank you.

1057
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:59,700
My mom made it alive, thanks to you guys.

1058
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:04,650
We only did our duty as Guardians.

1059
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:07,420
It was mostly to save our own butts, though.

1060
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,540
Um...

1061
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:16,780
If you can, I want you to take this letter to my father.

1062
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:20,930
That would be against the rule, too...

1063
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:27,440
Maybe I can, because I can't remember the rules.

1064
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:31,230
I envy your carefree life.

1065
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:35,510
See ya. I wanted to taste your liver.

1066
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:39,880
I wanted to eat Kouichi in one bite!

1067
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,410
I...

1068
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,670
...just want tangerines.

1069
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,560
By the way, what's in there?

1070
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,500
Uh, oh!

1071
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:04,770
Stop! These are my private stuff!

1072
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,490
Never mind. I want my memory to be filled with fond ones.

1073
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:21,250
Go on.

1074
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:26,190
We'll take you up on your offer.

1075
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:47,430
Thank you, everyone.

1076
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:48,730
I'll never forget you.

1077
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:51,820
Girls always say that.

1078
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:54,780
Well then, farewell.

1079
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:10,890
Bye-bye!

1080
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,770
<i>Dear Dad,

1081
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:50,140
<i>I'm doing well.

1082
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:53,070
<i>I'm sorry for saying such a terrible thing on that day.

1083
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:55,690
<i>All this time, I wanted to apologize for that.

1084
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,650
<i>The three yokai saved my mom.

1085
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,340
<i>I hope you would thank them as well.

1086
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:05,990
<i>Maybe,

1087
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:09,330
<i>you're in another form right now.

1088
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:15,190
<i>I will live my life to the fullest, together with Mom.

1089
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:18,430
<i>Please always watch over us,

1090
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:21,030
<i>with a little bit of anxiety.

1091
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,870
<i>To my dear dad.

1092
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,030
<i>Momo.

1093
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:35,920
I think I have an idea of what he wanted to write on that letter.

1094
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,270
Really?

1095
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:41,360
He wanted to apologize for what he did.

1096
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,570
You think?

1097
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,220
Yeah.

1098
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:48,500
Writing up a research paper was like breathing for your father,

1099
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,300
but he was really bad at writing letters.

1100
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:54,000
I'm sure he couldn't put his feelings into words.

1101
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:58,730
He always worried too much other how others felt.

1102
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:14,180
He loved the sea.

1103
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:15,520
Yes.

1104
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:20,160
I'm sorry for hitting you.

1105
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,050
And I didn't understand you...

1106
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:26,620
No, I should be the one apologizing.

1107
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,800
I made you worry.

1108
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,070
That's because I scolded you.

1109
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:34,770
But still, I'm sorry.

1110
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:48,160
All this time, I thought I had to take care of everything,

1111
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,810
and it backfired.

1112
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:54,090
I made you feel lonely.

1113
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:55,520
No, I'm fine.

1114
01:49:56,130 --> 01:50:00,190
I'll try to consult with you next time.

1115
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:02,180
Okay.

1116
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,150
But I'm not very helpful.

1117
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:07,000
I already know that!

1118
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,640
One more thing.

1119
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:19,480
Thank you, Momo.

1120
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,930
Go for it, Dad!

1121
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:41,270
Yeah!

1122
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:44,240
Awesome, Dad!

1123
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,510
Momo.

1124
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:48,740
Hey!

1125
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,620
Let's go home.

1126
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:21,300
Mom!

1127
01:52:41,810 --> 01:52:44,690
Dear Momo

1128
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,550
Mom...

1129
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:15,340
There's something written on it?

1130
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:24,470
"I'm proud of you.

1131
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:26,840
Take care of your mom.

1132
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:29,480
I'll always watch over you.

1133
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:32,480
From Dad."

1134
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:42,720
It's gone.

1135
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:47,920
Momo...

1136
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,800
Mom!

1137
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:57,700
There's no mistake. That's Dad.

1138
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:00,080
He's so straight to the point.

1139
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:00,910
Yeah.

1140
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,700
Hey, Momo.

1141
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:43,710
What happened to your friends?

1142
01:54:44,890 --> 01:54:46,610
They went back home.

1143
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:50,110
Really?

1144
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:02,130
You scared?

1145
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:07,070
I've got a feelin' I can jump today.

1146
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:12,290
All right!

1147
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,150
Thank you.

1148
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:03,390
That was so cool!

1149
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:05,200
You did great, Miyaura.

1150
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:07,470
Now you're one of us island kids!

1151
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:10,970
I'm impressed that you learned to jump so soon.

1152
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:24,490
Sound of the wind moved my heart years later

1153
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:34,630
My memory projects you in the faraway sky

1154
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:44,840
When I find myself wandering along the path to the sea

1155
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:54,850
Unchanging summer sunlight still shines upon me

1156
01:56:54,850 --> 01:57:00,030
Never-ending blue sky expanded above

1157
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:09,870
When I expressed my feelings to the person forever in my heart

1158
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:23,510
Let the passing clouds carry the song that connects our soul

1159
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:40,900
The wind caressed my cheeks as seasons pass by

1160
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:50,940
Wherever you are, my dear love, please kindly watch over me

1161
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:56,180
The town shimmers under the heat

1162
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:01,320
Surrounded by the sound of waves

1163
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:11,600
Where is the fragment of my dream hiding?

1164
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:21,610
Beautiful utopia, grant me this wish

1165
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:31,720
I put my hands together and pray for everybody's happiness

1166
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:40,080
Life binds eternal love

1167
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:07,630
Never-ending blue sky expands above

1168
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:17,840
I expressed my feelings to the person forever in my heart

1169
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:27,930
With a smile on my face until the day we meet again

1170
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:38,350
Beautiful utopia, forever my home town

1171
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:45,830
I'll dream of the day

1172
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:55,540
When we cross the rainbow bridge after the rain of tears

1173
01:59:55,540 --> 02:00:06,010
Let's walk together
