Sosuke, come right back!

15
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,955
Okay.

16
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,723
A goldfish...

17
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,904
It's stuck.

18
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,756
That was weird.

19
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,393
Ow!

20
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,981
Is it dead?

21
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,070
It licked me...it's alive.

22
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,242
Sosuke, we're leaving!

23
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,121
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

24
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,969
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

25
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,313
Did you find her?

26
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,988
What, captured by a human?

27
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,660
This is bad...very bad.

28
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,688
Are you dead?

29
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,198
You're alive!

30
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,545
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

31
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,881
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

32
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,550
A goldfish?

33
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,052
Down by the rocks.

34
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,290
I'm sorry, but you can't
use weed killer here.

35
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:54,673
Heavens no! This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.

36
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,551
As long as
it's not weed killer.

37
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,261
Good day!

38
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,438
This is <i>very</i> bad.

39
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,775
What a creepy guy.

40
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,195
But don't <i>you</i> say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

41
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,780
I won't.

42
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,450
Are you taking
that to school?

43
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,952
Won't the teacher complain?

44
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,956
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

45
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,625
She's cute!

46
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,300
They're using the dry dock.

47
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,471
Here, eat this
before we get there.

48
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,641
Maybe she's hungry.

49
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,809
Want some?

50
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,480
Hey, my cut is gone!

51
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,486
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

52
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,239
She's really special!
She can do magic.

53
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,493
She fixed my cut.

54
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,672
Want some ham?

55
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,649
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.

56
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,716
Oh no...

57
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,053
Disgusting!

58
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,055
Hurry, Lisa!

59
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,567
Such filth! Intolerable!

60
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,070
Good morning!

61
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,538
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.

62
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,936
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.

63
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,104
Have fun.

64
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,898
See you.

65
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,692
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

66
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,736
Could you get
Noriko's wheelchair?

67
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,961
Good morning, Sosuke.

68
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,798
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.

69
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,216
My!

70
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,801
Hello, Sosuke.

71
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,303
Can't talk now, Toki.

72
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,104
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

73
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,107
I know!

74
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,823
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.

75
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,452
What if a cat comes?

76
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,800
Stay here, I'll be right back.

77
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,518
See you later.

78
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,648
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.

79
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,359
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

80
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,444
Good morning, teacher.

81
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,863
Hello Sosuke.

82
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,531
How are you?

83
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,830
- Sosuke!
- Kumiko...

84
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,166
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.

85
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,459
Oh...

86
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,336
Let's play, Sosuke!

87
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,547
Not now. I'm busy.

88
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,132
How come?

89
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,886
- I told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.

90
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,220
Yeah!

91
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,076
Ponyo!

92
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,919
Sosuke!

93
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,086
Kumiko...

94
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,755
What's that?

95
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,965
You're not supposed to
bring stuff.

96
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,345
But these trees
aren't on school grounds.

97
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,763
Show me.

98
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,557
Oh, a goldfish.

99
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,935
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.

100
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,395
Ponyo? I want to see!

101
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,689
Promise not to tell?

102
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,107
I promise.

103
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,111
Isn't she cute?

104
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,288
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.

105
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:27,107
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

106
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,988
I'll give you
some more water.

107
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,136
Ponyo!

108
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,144
You scared me.

109
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:15,155
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.

110
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:20,201
But he's supposed
to be in school.

111
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,537
I must be hearing things.

112
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,873
Here I am, Yoshie.

113
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,211
I knew I heard your voice.

114
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,548
Do I have a secret?

115
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,549
Yes!

116
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,217
Bingo!

117
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,179
Okay, what color is my secret?

118
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,683
- Red!
- Red!

119
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,477
Good guess.

120
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,396
How'd you know?

121
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,898
Show us.

122
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,357
All right.

123
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,320
Oh, how pretty!

124
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,072
Very cute!

125
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,406
Her name is Ponyo.

126
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:02,077
She loves ham
and she can do magic.

127
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,581
I cut my thumb,
but she fixed it.

128
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,337
I wonder if she'd
fix our legs.

129
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,591
We could run around
just like you.

130
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,595
Well, I'd have
to ask Ponyo first.

131
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,931
Can I take a look?

132
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,474
Sure, Toki.

133
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,104
Heavens, it has a face!

134
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,901
Put it back
before it brings a tsunami!

135
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,737
You're so superstitious, Toki.

136
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,616
That's what
the old stories say.

137
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,743
Fish like that are bad luck.

138
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,624
The tsunami! It's here!

139
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,794
The tsunami is here!

140
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,467
What's wrong, Toki?

141
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,011
Just look at my clothes!

142
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,312
Sosuke!

143
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,319
Sosuke!

144
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,161
Sosuke!

145
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,997
Come back here and apologize!

146
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:42,177
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

147
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,430
Sosuke.

148
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,518
Sosuke.

149
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,857
Ponyo!

150
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,653
Ponyo. Sosuke.

151
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,198
Ponyo...loves...

152
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,033
...Sosuke!

153
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,373
I love you too.

154
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,543
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

155
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,585
Ponyo!

156
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,756
Ponyo!

157
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,137
Ponyo!

158
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,058
Sosuke!

159
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,103
Ponyo!

160
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,834
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.

161
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,295
It just can't be helped.

162
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,173
Ponyo was born in the sea.

163
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,383
She went back home,
that's all.

164
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,679
Anyway, let's hope
that creepy guy is gone.

165
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,765
One lick?

166
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,184
Hurry, it's melting!

167
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,022
Not bad!

168
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,530
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.

169
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,701
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

170
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,230
No more ocean today, okay?

171
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,758
Sosuke?

172
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,469
Time to come inside.

173
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,474
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

174
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,978
Maybe. There's only one way
to find out.

175
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:19,620
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

176
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,207
Hello?

177
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,126
Yes, it's me.

178
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,795
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

179
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:32,300
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

180
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,802
Okay. Here's Lisa.

181
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:39,307
Koichi? Yes...
What?!

182
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,268
Can't you get out of it?

183
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:46,147
Fine...leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

184
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,982
I give up!

185
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,820
Why bother?

186
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,490
C'mon Sosuke,
let's eat out!

187
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,326
I want to eat here.

188
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,022
There he is!

189
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:31,025
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

190
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,886
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

191
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,930
Your wife must be upset.

192
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:09,063
He says he's sorry.

193
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:09,897
J...

JERK!!

203
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:17,738

JERK!!!!!

206
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,622
He says he loves you!

207
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,750
Lots and lots!

208
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,004

JERK

JERK

215
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,391
Wow, that's cool!

GOOD LUCK

224
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,446
THANKS

225
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,324
LOVE AND KISSES

226
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:24,263
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.

227
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,477
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

228
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,650
I hope she isn't crying.

229
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,616
Okay, let's cheer up!

230
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,161
<i>"I'm happy as can be..."</i>

231
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,330
Ow!

232
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,998
Don't worry, Sosuke.

233
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,168
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

234
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:01,092
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

235
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,436
This is all my fault.

236
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:17,191
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

237
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,320
How often have
I warned you about humans?

238
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,781
Their very breath is polluted.

239
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,325
Come, you must eat.

240
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,869
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

241
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,205
I want ham!

242
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,711
Ham?! What on earth
have you been doing?

243
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,672
Answer me, Brunhilde!

244
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,217
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.

245
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,219
Ponyo?

246
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,721
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

247
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,016
I want to be human!

248
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,726
Human?

249
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,855
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

250
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,400
They rob the sea of life.

251
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,070
I was human myself...once.

252
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,698
I finally escaped
that awful heritage.

253
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,576
I want hands!

254
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,203
I don't like this!

255
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,874
I want legs like Sosuke!

256
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,750
Of all the nonsense!

257
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,440
Look at me!
Hands and feet!

258
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,612
No...don't tell me
you tasted human blood!

259
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,113
Wanna see Sosuke!

260
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,284
No! His blood has
deranged your DNA!

261
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,286
Revert...revert...

262
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,128
Go back...go back!

263
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,968
It's not working.
I need more power.

264
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,566
Let me out!

265
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:28,989
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!

266
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:42,002
Just like her mother...so strong.

267
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,678
She should remain
innocent and pure forever.

268
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,368
I can't hold her for long.

269
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:17,204
I need her mother's help.

270
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,174
No! My elixir is
too strong for you!

271
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,594
Shoo! Go away!

272
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,888
My crab shields were weakening.

273
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,349
I nearly upset
Nature's balance.

274
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,559
I must stay calm.

275
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,021
When I think
of meeting HER again...!

276
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,733
This batch should be ready.

277
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,910
No leaks down here.

278
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,375
This door is loose.

279
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,257
I'll fix it later.

280
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,933
If even one creature
got in here...!

281
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,125
Superb!

282
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:49,838
I feel the ocean's power
in my very DNA.

283
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:54,760
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

284
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,930
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Era!

285
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:01,141
This revolting era
of Man will be over.

286
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,815
Better fix this door.

287
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,066
Teeth!

288
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm going back to Sosuke!

289
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,562
A waterspout?

290
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,023
Captain, look there!

291
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,571
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!

292
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,241
What's that?

293
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,791
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!

294
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,965
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!

295
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,102
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.

296
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,606
- Thanks.
- Take care.

297
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,777
Do you want
to wait here for Lisa?

298
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:07,114
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

299
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,782
Goodbye.

300
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,951
Be careful out there.

301
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,747
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.

302
00:40:56,872 --> 00:41:00,000
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?

303
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,670
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.

304
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,172
Are you sure?

305
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,008
Don't worry,
we'll be just fine.

306
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:13,346
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.

307
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,017
Wait for me, Sosuke.

308
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,030
Yoshie.

309
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:35,702
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.

310
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,996
This is for you.

311
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,502
My, what is it?

312
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,295
One for you, Noriko.

313
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,880
Thank you.

314
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,424
Can't see a thing.

315
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,427
This is such foolishness!

316
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,555
I don't want
to spend the night.

317
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:03,730
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!

318
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:08,568
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

319
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,404
<i>Extremely powerful...
Micro-typhoon...</i>

320
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,074
<i>Ships should exercise
extreme caution...</i>

321
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,285
This TV is useless.

322
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:22,415
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

323
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,584
You should go home, Sosuke.

324
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:30,215
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.

325
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,559
Here's yours, Toki.

326
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,440
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

327
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:48,692
Like this.

328
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,113
I know!
It's a grasshopper.

329
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,448
No, the <i>Koganei Maru.</i>

330
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,119
That's your father's ship.

331
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,746
Still looks like
a grasshopper.

332
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,001
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

333
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,463
Goodbye, everybody.

334
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,632
Goodbye.

335
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,802
Don't let the wind
blow you away!

336
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,471
Climb over.

337
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,978
The phones are out too.

338
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,545
The sea is puffed up!

339
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,843
Will the ships sink?

340
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,973
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

341
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:17,155
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!

342
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,210
You've got to turn back!

343
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,879
People are going
to the shelters.

344
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:37,676
But there are people
at the senior center!

345
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,763
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

346
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:45,058
I've just got to get home.

347
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:47,852
You'd better go
around the mountain.

348
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,732
Here we go, Sosuke.

349
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,568
No! Stop!

350
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:57,696
Look out for that wave!

351
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,077
Here it comes!

352
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:06,579
Run for it, Lisa!

353
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:49,622
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt, Sosuke!

354
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,055
Hold on tight!

355
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,983
That wave won't quit!

356
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,373
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

357
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,712
Where?

358
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,056
The sea keeps rising.

359
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,767
Where did you see her?

360
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,395
Running on top of a fish.

361
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,855
A fish!?

362
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,735
Come on, Sosuke.

363
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:02,088
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.

364
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:57,810
A little girl!

365
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,147
Here, you'd better
come with us.

366
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,650
Stay there, Sosuke.

367
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,177
Sosuke, do you know her?

368
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:53,825
Ponyo?

369
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,995
Yes, it's me!

370
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:58,621
It's you!

371
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:04,377
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

372
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,557
I made it!

373
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,911
Now listen, children.

374
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:42,582
No matter how strange
everything seems...

375
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,918
...we have to stay calm.

376
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,587
Now be good.

377
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,760
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

378
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,596
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.

379
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,269
I'll bring you a towel.

380
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,746
C'mon, Ponyo!

381
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,125
It smells just like you!

382
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:29,796
Ouch!

383
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:30,922
Ponyo!

384
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,430
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.

385
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,645
Such pretty red hair!

386
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,233
But your clothes are dry...

387
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:54,737
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

388
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,201
I like this!

389
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:03,705
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?

390
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,165
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

391
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:07,667
Coming!

392
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,253
Think we'll have water?

393
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,337
Sure!

394
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,880
Sure!

395
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:16,467
Water!

396
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,844
Water!

397
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,639
We have a tank outside.

398
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,518
What about the gas?

399
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,853
Presto!

400
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:27,979
All right!

401
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,188
All right!

402
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,357
It's propane.

403
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,778
Okay, take your seats.

404
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,697
Okay!

405
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,824
Over here, Ponyo.

406
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,206
Sit down, like this.

407
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,211
Put your stuff down.

408
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,048
You need your hands.

409
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,884
I have feet!

410
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,054
Wow!

411
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,310
What are you two doing?

412
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,229
Her feet are like hands.

413
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,250
There you go.

414
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,218
This is the best!

415
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:30,601
That hit the spot.

416
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,355
What shall we do now?

417
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,315
I want ham!

418
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,651
She's crazy about ham.

419
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,280
Then let's eat.

420
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,449
But first let's start
the generator.

421
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,996
We need electricity
to talk to Koichi.

422
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:53,583
Koichi is my father.

423
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,418
Is he a bad sorcerer?

424
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:59,005
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.

425
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,632
What about your father, Ponyo?

426
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:05,011
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.

427
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,014
I ran away.

428
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,267
What about your mother?

429
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,687
I love my mother!

430
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,523
She's really scary.

431
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,150
Sounds like Lisa.

432
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,032
Can you help me, Ponyo?

433
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,884
Maybe the fuel's too old?

434
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:46,552
Is it clogged?

435
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:47,887
Clogged.

436
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,389
It's clogged there.

437
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,697
Success!

438
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,741
All bright!

439
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,911
Wow, Ponyo!

440
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,098
Antenna! Antenna!

441
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:35,309
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

442
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,938
I can't see a single light.

443
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,457
So loud!

444
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,792
What's wrong?

445
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,421
Even the radio
is out of whack.

446
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,801
This is JA4LL...JA4LL.

447
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,886
<i>Come in, Koichi.</i>

448
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:15,307
<i>It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.</i>

449
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,936
We're going to have dinner.

450
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,813
Ham!

451
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,658
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

452
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,301
It's not ready yet.

453
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,511
It takes three minutes.

454
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,028
Close your eyes!

455
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,697
Not yet!

456
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,868
No peeking, Ponyo.

457
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,707
Okay, you can look now.

458
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:24,710
And...presto!

459
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,051
Ham!

460
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,844
Good for you, Ponyo.

461
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,243
Ponyo went to sleep.

462
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,669
Is her home far away?

463
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,921
I think it must be.

464
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,439
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.

465
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,900
Because Ponyo's asleep?

466
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,902
Look over there!

467
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,246
It's moving.
Someone's up there.

468
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,498
People from
the senior center?

469
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,131
It's gone.

470
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:53,966
That's the peak road.

471
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,805
Sosuke, stay there
with Ponyo.

472
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:15,154
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

473
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,492
I'm going to the senior center.

474
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:21,827
I'll go too.

475
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:25,122
Stay here with Ponyo.

476
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:28,667
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

477
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:30,586
I'm going with you!

478
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,842
Sosuke, our house
is a lighthouse in the storm.

479
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:40,971
Everyone out there
is depending on us.

480
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,140
Someone has to stay here.

481
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:48,729
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

482
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:53,525
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

483
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:58,197
Just knowing you're
here will help me.

484
01:00:58,364 --> 01:01:01,367
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.

485
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:03,869
Promise?

486
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,664
I promise.

487
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:08,374
You promised!

488
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,918
I love you, Sosuke.

489
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:08,934
I see the lights of the town!

490
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,227
Finally...

491
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,396
Now we can navigate.

492
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,940
I've never seen
that town before.

493
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,615
Did the storm
blow us to America?

494
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,636
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...

495
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:46,388
Those are ships!

496
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,485
The sea is piled up
into a mountain!

497
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:04,323
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?

498
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,788
We lost power!

499
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:13,916
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!

500
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,000
Aye-aye!

501
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,349
Something is coming!

502
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,045
A sea goddess!?

503
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:11,682
The engine!

504
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:12,891
We're saved!

505
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,061
The engine started again.
It was Her!

506
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:19,857
Protect us from harm...

507
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,886
Come on, come on.

508
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:07,237
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?

509
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,799
Good heavens...she's human!

510
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,762
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?

511
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,523
Stop! This is unsafe!

512
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:46,944
Stop that at once!

513
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,996
I'm simply trying
to save your sister.

514
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,338
She's here.
She answered my call!

515
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,712
- Fujimoto...
- You came, my beloved.

516
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:49,548
Such a beautiful ocean.

517
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:58,348
So full of magic,
like my ancient Devonian sea.

518
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,059
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood...

519
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,438
...and plundered all of my elixir.

520
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:09,026
Ponyo...what a lovely name.

521
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,408
It's all my fault.

522
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:21,538
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.

523
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,249
She doesn't understand
what she's done.

524
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:30,088
Now she's human, and she's
up there with her <i>boyfriend</i>!

525
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:34,426
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

526
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:46,063
No! The satellites are falling.

527
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,774
Earth's gravitational field...

528
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,777
Be still...

529
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:02,788
Sosuke...that is his name, yes?

530
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:10,128
You love your sister,
don't you?

531
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:17,302
Listen, dear...what if Ponyo
really became human?

532
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,805
Use the old magic.

533
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:24,893
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

534
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:29,648
But if it's not,
she'll turn to sea foam!

535
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:33,819
That's where we all
came from, dear.

536
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,822
But he's only five!

537
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,831
Sleep well, little children.

538
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,011
Sosuke!

539
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,681
Sosuke!

540
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,183
Ow!

541
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,855
Good morning, Ponyo.

542
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,315
Morning, Sosuke.

543
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:21,366
We almost got flooded.

544
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:48,810
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.

545
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,730
I wish we had a boat.

546
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,526
There's a boat!

547
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,905
We can't fit.

548
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,406
Can so.

549
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:18,590
Awesome!

550
01:10:20,509 --> 01:10:23,512
The candle's bigger too.

551
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:24,930
We can fit.

552
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,264
This is cool.

553
01:10:26,515 --> 01:10:27,766
Cool!

554
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,100
Grab that end.

555
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,105
Ready?

556
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,607
Ready!

557
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,455
She's seaworthy!

558
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:55,126
Awesome. No leaks!

559
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,796
Now we fill the boiler.

560
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,924
The water goes in here.

561
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,969
It goes in the boiler.

562
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,998
It's like a rocket!

563
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,673
Everything's shipshape.

564
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,341
Shipshape...

565
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,176
Shipshape?

566
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,011
Shipshape!

567
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:49,014
Shipshape! Shipshape!

568
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,204
Is it hot?

569
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,372
Hot!

570
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,046
It's hot.

571
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:26,718
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!

572
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:30,388
Hot hot hot!

573
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:39,856
It's hot.

574
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:52,077
Awesome!

575
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,748
We're shipshape, Sosuke!

576
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,750
This is great.

577
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:08,259
This is so much fun.

578
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,180
It's burning, Sosuke.

579
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,766
It's really hot.

580
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:19,270
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

581
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,439
Okay, I'm the lookout.

582
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,968
There's a road.

583
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:52,220
That's the road Lisa took.

584
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:56,307
I don't see her.

585
01:13:56,641 --> 01:14:00,145
You will.
She gave me her promise.

586
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:08,111
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!

587
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,405
There's Bothriolepis.

588
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:16,494
That one is...

589
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:17,787
Dipnorhynchus.

590
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,497
Dipnorhynchus!

591
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,958
That one's really huge.

592
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,835
That's Devonynchus.

593
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,296
Devonynchus!

594
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,846
Ahoy!

595
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:39,184
A boat!

596
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:41,936
Ahoy!

597
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,856
They're calling us.

598
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,942
Ahoy!

599
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:50,820
Ow!

600
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,537
Pretty good, huh?

601
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,876
Now, Ponyo.

602
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:13,218
Hello.

603
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:16,054
That's a wonderful
boat you have.

604
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:19,349
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

605
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,060
He's not little, he's Sosuke.

606
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,561
This is Ponyo.

607
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,981
I was a fish before.

608
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,733
A fish?

609
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,402
Ponyo...that's a nice name.

610
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,698
Have you seen Lisa?

611
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,242
Lisa?

612
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,869
She's not with you?

613
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,246
She's at the center.

614
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,747
The senior center...?

615
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,457
This is my baby.

616
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,948
Oh my, what happened?

617
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:24,622
Is that for us?

618
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,305
Give me the cup, dear.

619
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,394
Thank you.

620
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,479
Let's try it.

621
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,110
It's delicious!

622
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:56,404
Lisa made it.

623
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:58,406
It's for the baby.

624
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:04,120
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.

625
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:08,374
But this will help me
make milk for him.

626
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:12,921
Lisa gave me her milk too.

627
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:16,674
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

628
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,384
Sure.

629
01:17:19,177 --> 01:17:20,511
Thank you.

630
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:41,407
People from the town.
It's like a festival.

631
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:46,329
You there!
Do you need assistance?

632
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:51,542
Thanks, we're okay right now!

633
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,671
Then please follow us.

634
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:57,715
We're going to
the hotel on the peak.

635
01:17:57,966 --> 01:18:00,885
Okay! Will do.

636
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,888
The whole town's here.

637
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,724
I hope everyone's all right.

638
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:10,395
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.

639
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:17,068
Milk!

640
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:19,404
Oh my...

641
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:21,531
Milk!

642
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:24,158
She ate up all the ham.

643
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,245
This will help me
make good milk.

644
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:31,499
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

645
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:35,086
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.

646
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:37,088
Be careful!

647
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,881
Thank you both!

648
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,431
What is it, dear?

649
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,437
Don't cry.

650
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,124
Ponyo!

651
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,472
Sosuke!

652
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:32,310
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?

653
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:35,772
I'm going to pick her up.

654
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,317
So she survived that wave?

655
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,487
Sosuke, take me with you!

656
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,615
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.

657
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:49,285
Everyone from the center
evacuated to the park.

658
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,662
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!

659
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,833
We'll send a boat
for them later.

660
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,294
Good luck, captain!

661
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:50,221
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

662
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,228
We're okay.
I have another one.

663
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,898
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

664
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,739
Bye-bye.

665
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:12,910
Can you make this candle bigger?

666
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,579
All right.

667
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,004
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

668
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,387
Ponyo!

669
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,030
Ponyo! Ponyo!

670
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:49,340
Good...it's shallow enough to walk.

671
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,368
A road!

672
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,215
It's shrinking!

673
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,385
Ponyo!

674
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:58,242
Ponyo, wake up!

675
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,580
Sosuke...

676
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,087
Don't scare me.

677
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:13,257
I thought you were
turning into a fish.

678
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,604
Lisa's car!

679
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,106
Ponyo, that's her car!

680
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:34,487
Lisa!

681
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,158
Lisa!

682
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,914
Lisa!

683
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,793
Lisa!

684
01:24:57,218 --> 01:24:59,428
Lisa!

685
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,724
Lisa!

686
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,505
Here's your boat.

687
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,508
Your eyes are wet.

688
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:46,183
Let's find Lisa.

689
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:36,400
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?

690
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:39,069
Look, it's a whale!

691
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:45,534
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?

692
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:49,079
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares? It's wonderful.

693
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:54,585
Attention, please!
Gather round.

694
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:56,086
Coming!

695
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,922
Shall we?

696
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,092
It's so nice to run.

697
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,261
Meet you there!

698
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,058
The winner!

699
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,771
You're so fast, Kayo.

700
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,273
Quiet, everyone!

701
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:19,401
The moment
of truth is at hand.

702
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:22,071
Sosuke and Ponyo
are almost here.

703
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:23,614
It's so romantic.

704
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:27,993
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!

705
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,621
Quiet!

706
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:35,960
Very soon, you will bear witness
to a sacred trial of love.

707
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:41,799
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not
up to something, are you?

708
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:44,969
Nonsense, he's her father.

709
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:49,431
They'll be fine...
if she doesn't wake up.

710
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:51,308
Now excuse me!

711
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,819
I'd like to believe him...

712
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:04,488
Where's Lisa gone to?

713
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:09,368
She's been talking with
Ponyo's mother for ages.

714
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,962
I hope she's okay.

715
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:22,673
What are they talking about?

716
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,509
Let's find out. Lisa!

717
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:28,929
Lisa!

718
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:41,358
We're all rooting
for Sosuke and Ponyo!

719
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:55,873
Lisa!

720
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,543
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.

721
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,379
He's a strong little boy.

722
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:06,884
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.

723
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:17,561
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

724
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:28,656
"STOP"

725
01:29:33,202 --> 01:29:35,412
I've been here before.

726
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:37,581
Ponyo?

727
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:39,917
I don't like this place.

728
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:46,090
Don't let go of my hand.

729
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,462
Ponyo!

730
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,607
Ponyo!

731
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:54,950
Ponyo!

732
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:19,224
Please don't die!

733
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,351
Ponyo!

734
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,271
Wake up, Ponyo!

735
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,357
Let her sleep.

736
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:30,360
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

737
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:33,864
Lisa and the old ladies
are waiting too.

738
01:31:34,782 --> 01:31:35,866
Lisa?!

739
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:39,495
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.

740
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:44,958
Let's not wake her.

741
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:47,211
Sosuke!

742
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:50,589
Don't listen to him!

743
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:54,343
He tricked everyone
into going with him.

744
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:55,344
Toki!

745
01:31:55,469 --> 01:31:57,471
But he couldn't fool me!

746
01:31:58,222 --> 01:32:03,727
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?

747
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:07,481
If the Moon comes
any closer, we're finished!

748
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:10,859
Is that the best
you can do?

749
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,695
Sosuke, come here!

750
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:17,282
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.

751
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,409
Don't make me use force.

752
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,079
Ponyo!

753
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,250
Is this how you
treat your father?

754
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,341
Ponyo!

755
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:37,094
Run, Sosuke!

756
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:39,429
You don't understand!

757
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:46,228
You can make it!

758
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,731
Jump!

759
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,355
Now what?

760
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:26,161
Lisa!

761
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,537
Sosuke!

762
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:28,872
Ponyo!

763
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:37,506
- Look over there.
- Where are we?

764
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,018
So, you are Sosuke.

765
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:53,563
Hello. Are you
Ponyo's mother?

766
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:54,690
Yes.

767
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:59,736
I want to thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

768
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,867
Ponyo wanted to be like you,
but she unleashed a terrible power.

769
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:10,706
To become human, she must be loved...

770
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:13,834
...for who she really is.

771
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:18,422
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

772
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:19,589
Yes.

773
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:23,719
Your blood made her human...almost.

774
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:24,761
That's right!

775
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,390
Ponyo licked
my cut and made it better.

776
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,767
So that's why she changed!

777
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,772
Can you accept her as she is?

778
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:38,108
I'll always love Ponyo...

779
01:35:38,275 --> 01:35:40,777
...whether she's a fish, a human...

780
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,405
...or in between.

781
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:59,129
Come, Ponyo.

782
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:18,231
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

783
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:24,654
But first, you must
give up your powers.

784
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:26,823
Can you do that?

785
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:40,796
Kiss this bubble
when you return to land...

786
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:45,342
...and Ponyo
will be a little girl.

787
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,347
Way to go, Ponyo!

788
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:53,809
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

789
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:03,276
Now the planet is safe again.

790
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:08,532
Splendid, Sosuke!

791
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:16,373
Sosuke!

792
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:42,190
I'm grateful, Lisa.

793
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:45,235
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

794
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,916
There you are!
Are you all right?

795
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:06,840
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

796
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,092
Don't bother, we'll walk.

797
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:11,428
It's all so exciting.

798
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,766
I believe this is yours.

799
01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:20,270
Thanks.

800
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:24,774
I hope you'll
forgive me...may I?

801
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:32,574
Take good care of her.

802
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,453
It's Koichi!

803
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:42,959
Koichi!

804
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:49,925
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!

805
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,804
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!
