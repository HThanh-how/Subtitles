INTERNATIONAL HOUSE

5
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>
<i>The plane is about to take off.</i>

6
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>Yutaka and I first met Rikako</i>
<i>two years ago.</i>

7
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,570
<i>It was the summer of our junior year.</i>

8
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,792
<i>Yutaka called me at work.</i>

9
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,171
Hurry up kid!
More dishes! Keep 'em coming!

10
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,464
Okay!

11
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,176
Taku, telephone!

12
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,177
Coming.

13
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,974
-Hello.
-<i>Taku?</i>

14
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,183
Hey, Yutaka.

15
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,854
<i>Come to school</i>
<i>as soon as you finish today.</i>

16
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,149
<i>I'll be here waiting for you.</i>

17
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,483
Okay.

18
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,697
Sorry, I have to leave early today.

19
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,198
Now wait a minute!

20
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,784
See you tomorrow!

21
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,582
You can't rely on kids!

22
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,174
See you!

23
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,055
TOSA - KATSUO

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,002
Yutaka!

25
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,963
You got here fast.

26
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,673
You told me to!

27
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,674
Take a look.

28
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,472
Who is it? I can't see.

29
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,059
Just transferred to my class.

30
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,602
Her name's Rikako Muto.

31
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,479
-From next semester?
-Yeah.

32
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,566
A mid-year transfer? That's unusual.

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,486
She moved here from Tokyo, that's why.

34
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,824
I just showed her around the school.

35
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,618
That's right,
you're on the student council.

36
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,121
You really like her, huh?

37
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,458
Anyone would, she's really good looking.

38
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,501
Really?

39
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,758
I can't tell,
and we can't just walk down and look.

40
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,262
If you want, we can go down

41
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,098
and say we have a question.

42
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,018
Nah, let's not go that far.

43
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,980
The teachers know I'm working this summer

44
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,940
and not taking classes.

45
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,944
Still mad
about the junior high school trip?

46
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,198
I don't like the way they just canceled it

47
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,409
and tried to buy us off
with Hawaii in high school.

48
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,953
Do they think we're stupid?

49
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,459
Everyone's excited about Hawaii.
I think it was a good move.

50
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,672
A relaxing trip will help us
cram for college entrance exams.

51
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,721
Hawaii's expensive.
I need to make some money.

52
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,889
STUDENTS’ CLUB

53
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,685
Just remember
to keep up with your studies.

54
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,104
-Don't fall behind.
-Sure.

55
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,567
By the way, was there something
you wanted to talk about?

56
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,820
Not really. I just felt like seeing you.

57
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,948
I'll get my bike. Wait by the gate.

58
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,908
Okay.

59
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,459
<i>All through junior high school</i>
<i>and high school,</i>

60
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,088
<i>Yutaka and I were never in the same class.</i>

61
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,843
<i>Even so,</i>
<i>I always felt he was a close friend.</i>

62
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,056
<i>It all started in our last year</i>
<i>of junior high school</i>

63
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>when the school trip</i>
<i>to Kyoto was suddenly canceled.</i>

64
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,145
<i>We regret to announce</i>

65
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,525
<i>that the junior high school trip</i>
<i>has been canceled for this year.</i>

66
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>In the future, junior high</i>
<i>and high school trips will be combined.</i>

67
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,951
<i>Last year, our college placement results</i>

68
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,246
<i>were lower than those</i>
<i>of the prefectural high schools.</i>

69
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,959
<i>Our school's proud traditions</i>
<i>and your obligations to your parents</i>

70
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,378
<i>make this completely unacceptable.</i>

71
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,047
<i>To restore our school's honor,</i>

72
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,885
<i>high school seniors</i>
<i>must redouble their efforts.</i>

73
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,056
<i>You must set an example</i>
<i>for our junior high school seniors.</i>

74
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,016
It has nothing to do with us.

75
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,186
Let's go see Miss Sayama. Come on, Taku!

76
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,438
Yeah.

77
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,400
<i>The whole thing was so stupid</i>

78
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,570
<i>that we decided</i>
<i>to complain to our homeroom teacher.</i>

79
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,164
We all think this is unfair.

80
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,543
Canceling the trip won't help our grades.

81
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,131
The school owes us a detailed explanation.

82
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,051
Come back when you're in the top 100!

83
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,680
But I'm at 89 already!

84
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,771
Don't pressure Miss Sayama
just because she's a woman!

85
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,278
<i>We thought that was the end of the matter.</i>

86
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,282
<i>But a week later,</i>
<i>at the morning assembly...</i>

87
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:22,668
Your parents have also
approved the trip cancellation.

88
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,299
If you're still not satisfied,
we'll explain the decision.

89
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,803
Raise your hand
if you're still not satisfied.

90
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,895
Seriously?

91
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,439
He's got guts.

92
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,984
<i>It was Yutaka Matsuno.</i>

93
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,986
Okay.

94
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,532
We'll explain the decision
for students who raised their hands.

95
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,993
Go to the art room after school.
Dismissed!

3RD YEAR, CLASS 3 TAKU MORISAKI

99
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,335
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
ON THE CLASS TRIP BEING CANCELED.

100
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,255
IT'S ONLY TO MAKE THE TEACHERS
AND PARENTS FEEL BETTER.

101
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,274
I ran into Yamao and the others just now.

102
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,736
They're sorry for not coming.

103
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,238
Don't hold it against them.

104
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,158
Those jerks...

105
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,219
3RD YEAR, CLASS 4, YUTAKA MATSUNO

106
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,306
I CAN'T AGREE
WITH THIS UNREASONABLE DECISION.

107
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,933
EVEN 10, 20 YEARS AFTER I GRADUATE,

108
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,313
I'LL STILL THINK THE SCHOOL WAS WRONG.

109
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,316
Wow!

110
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,322
You're already thinking
20 years into the future.

111
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>After that, I always thought of Yutaka</i>

112
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,297
<i>a bit differently from my other friends.</i>

113
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,282
This is my friend Taku Morisaki.

114
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,162
This is Rikako Muto.
She's transferring to my class.

115
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,748
See you, then!

116
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,167
See you next semester.

117
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,138
What, you already made your move?

118
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,017
Huh? No,
she asked me where the bookstore was.

119
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,062
She needs to buy her textbooks.

120
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
OBIYAMACHI MALL

121
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:25,119
The cook where I work
is this former gang member.

122
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,663
Sometimes his old habits come out,

123
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,791
like the way he squats when he smokes.

124
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,758
What?

125
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,346
Do you think there's something
behind her transfer?

126
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,598
Huh?

127
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,478
<i>Ah, so that's it!</i>

128
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,356
<i>That's the real reason</i>
<i>Yutaka wanted to see me.</i>

129
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,279
Maybe her dad got transferred
or something like that.

130
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,409
See you!

131
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,081
<i>I felt unreasonably irritated to know</i>

132
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,417
<i>that Yutaka was interested in Rikako.</i>

133
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,547
<i>Better forget it!</i>
<i>Girls only care about looks.</i>

134
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,967
<i>I thought she'd never see his real value.</i>

135
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,013
Here I go!

136
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,016
-What are you doing?
-Get it together!

137
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,018
<i>When the new term started,</i>

138
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:36,941
<i>Rikako was a bit of a sensation</i>
<i>with us simple country boys.</i>

139
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,278
Hey Taku, check out the girls!

140
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,821
Ariga, right?

141
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,410
You can do it!

142
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,454
I know, they're big.

143
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,831
No! The far court!

144
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,835
Do it!

145
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,319
She's really cool.

146
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,446
She just beat the tennis club captain!

147
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,283
She's really something!

148
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,661
She plays like a pro!

149
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,539
Tokyo kids can really hit the ball!

150
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,166
-She stands out.
-Nice legs too!

151
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,794
Bet that type's hard to handle.

152
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,300
Rikako really stands out, huh?

153
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,636
I don't know why you'd say that.

154
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,431
Hey, Yutaka!

155
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,026
Sorry.

156
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,863
Rikako's out of place in class.

157
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,783
I think it's because
she stands out too much.

158
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,869
Out of place, huh?

159
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,871
Yeah... in lots of ways.

160
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:26,634
-But I studied so hard.
-Yeah, the one from Tokyo.

161
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,220
She really stands out, huh?

162
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,390
She's already 12th in our year!

163
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,852
Sports and study. She's a super woman!

164
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,481
-Let's see Taku, you're...
-Number 92.

165
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,859
You were a better student in junior high.

166
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,116
What an attitude!

167
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,409
She's so stuck up!

168
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,245
That's enough! Stop gossiping.

169
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,289
Time for class!

170
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,054
What's wrong? Got a crush on Rikako?

171
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,892
No, but she doesn't seem very happy.

172
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,230
Oh, come off it. She's 12th. 12th!

173
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,817
It looks good on you.

174
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,236
You always braid your hair.

175
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,755
I hear you have a new transfer student?

176
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,258
Yeah. Why?

177
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,594
I hear her grades are excellent.

178
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,264
Tokyo students really are top notch.

179
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,933
Who told you?

180
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,144
They were talking about it in town.

181
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,523
Rikako's family is related to the Mutos

182
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,942
of Muto Fruit Packing.

183
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,071
Her mother moved back for family reasons.

184
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,282
She brought the two children with her.

185
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,329
Maybe her parents got divorced.

186
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,416
Is her father still in Tokyo?

187
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,043
I wonder.

188
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,377
I'm full.

189
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,921
Atsushi, mind your table manners!

190
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,717
Poor Rikako. With her grades,

191
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,927
she'll just go back to Tokyo for college.

192
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,681
Kids sure get jerked around.

193
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,933
Now don't talk like that!

194
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,936
A mother needs her children with her!

195
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,149
You don't need to get upset about it.

196
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,402
Relocating is a tough decision!

197
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,947
She can't leave them behind
just for school!

198
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,035
It's natural for her
to want them with her!

199
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,498
Speaking from experience, huh?

200
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,170
Now you be nice to Rikako!

201
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,465
She must be having a hard time adjusting.

202
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,050
Sure, sure.

203
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,084
Taku!

204
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,380
Taku! Telephone!

205
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,090
Okay!

206
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,098
Hello? Hey, Yutaka. What's going on?

207
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,683
<i>Well...</i>

208
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,476
What?

209
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>It's not really that important.</i>

210
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,356
What?

211
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,608
<i>I visited Rikako today!</i>

212
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,735
Where? At her house?

213
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,157
<i>She was out sick. I heard she lives alone.</i>

214
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,741
<i>I was worried.</i>

215
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,164
She lives alone? Her mother's house
isn't that far from school.

216
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,168
And you went to see her? Alone?

217
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,131
<i>Yeah. And... she was alone in bed!</i>

218
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,633
She was in bed. So?

219
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,011
<i>Nothing. That's it.</i>

220
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,556
<i>That's all.</i>

221
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,572
<i>So you like that kind of girl,</i>
<i>don't you, Yutaka?</i>

222
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,792
<i>The year ended and March came</i>

223
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>and with it, the long-awaited school trip.</i>

224
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,838
Taku!

225
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,340
Yes?

226
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,843
You're not going to the beach?

227
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,678
Today's our last day!

228
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,723
I've had an upset stomach all morning.

229
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,017
Too bad! See you, then!

230
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,310
So long.

231
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>And it was here</i>
<i>that all the trouble started.</i>

232
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,243
Taku!

233
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,580
Could you lend me some money?

234
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,339
Money?

235
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,009
What happened? Did you run out?

236
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,302
Well... not exactly.

237
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,599
I lost all the money I had with me!

238
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,184
That's awful!

239
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,687
Did you tell the teacher?

240
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,607
With traveler's checks,
you can get your money back.

241
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,027
I'll get in trouble.

242
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,782
Don't be silly! You've got to report it!

243
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:31,456
I'm sorry. Your Kochi dialect
reminds me of samurai movies.

244
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,709
Want to sit down?

245
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,963
Let me tell you what happened.

246
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:44,052
I mostly brought cash.
Travelers checks are a pain, right? So...

247
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,804
Cash? You mean dollars?

248
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,682
Right, about $400 in cash.

249
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,476
I must have left it somewhere.

250
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,231
That much? We were supposed
to bring less than ¥20,000 in cash!

251
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,360
The rest
was supposed to be traveler's checks.

252
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,612
Nobody really does that!

253
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,824
You sound like one of the teachers!

254
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,243
Are you a goody-goody?

255
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,871
Too bad. I heard you were different.

256
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,963
Your Tokyo dialect sounds so harsh!

257
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,675
Why? I'm not angry!

258
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,886
And I'm not a samurai!

259
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,017
You're mean, Taku.

260
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,728
Nobody ever called me harsh.

261
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,897
Is that how I sound?

262
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,941
Yeah. Everyone thinks so.

263
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:44,738
But they're afraid
you'll say they sound like samurai.

264
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,156
Okay, I'm sorry.

265
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,702
I didn't mean to make fun of you.

266
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,166
You hear dialects in dramas, right?

267
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,878
I thought dialects were all gone.

268
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,135
But Kochi people really talk that way.
I was shocked.

269
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:12,974
Still, I never told anyone
I felt that way, until today.

270
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,768
You better not.

271
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,646
At first I couldn't understand a word.

272
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,149
I kept asking people to say things twice.

273
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,445
Maybe that's why nobody likes me.

274
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,572
Who doesn't like you?

275
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,284
Everybody,
boys especially. Nobody talks to me.

276
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,330
Well, except Yutaka,
the class representative. He's nice.

277
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,541
Yeah, Yutaka's a good guy.

278
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,751
Did he tell you about me?

279
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,585
Yes.

280
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,173
I saw you working at the restaurant
during the winter vacation.

281
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,511
Yutaka was with me.
He said you work really hard.

282
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,888
Then he told me a lot about you.

283
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:56,101
Like your protest
over the canceled school trip.

284
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,146
He told you about that?

285
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,817
You must have a lot of money
from your job, right?

286
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,905
Okay, how much?

287
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,575
What can you spare?

288
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,287
I brought about ¥60,000 and $400.

289
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,499
I haven't spent much. How about $300?

290
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,544
Really?
Then could you lend me the ¥60,000?

291
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,804
Wait here.

292
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,696
Sixty thousand yen!

293
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,580
Okay, shall we go swimming, honey?

294
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,793
Much obliged, Mr. Morisaki!

295
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,005
Should I give it to you right here?

296
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:11,218
You're pretty cautious.
Okay, sit down right there.

297
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:17,015
Put it in this
handkerchief and hand it to me.

298
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,312
Feels like we're doing something illegal.

299
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,781
I probably can't pay you back right away.

300
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,492
I'm expecting some money, though.

301
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,327
Pay me back anytime.

302
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,205
Please don't tell anyone about this.

303
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,581
Sure, but why?

304
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,583
Mama would yell at me.

305
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,418
Mama...

306
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,300
What's her story?

307
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,056
Hey!

308
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:06,189
I'm surprised she knew so much about me!

309
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,693
So you guys are friends. Dating, huh?

310
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,944
That wasn't a date.

311
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,364
I ran into her over vacation.

312
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,866
I asked her to a movie and she said yes.

313
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,660
I was surprised.

314
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,954
I couldn't think of a thing to say.

315
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:26,626
We passed your restaurant,
so I started talking about you.

316
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,836
It really helped.

317
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,506
Maybe, but I just got hit up for a loan.

318
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,466
Rikako asked you for a loan?

319
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:38,555
Yeah. I walked by,
and she said she lost her money.

320
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,641
Maybe she remembered
I made money over the break.

321
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:46,104
So she lost all her money? Poor thing!

322
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,027
-Want to walk around town?
-Sure.

323
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,238
Wait a sec, I'll leave my stuff.

324
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,323
Sure.

325
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,209
-You got a suntan!
-Cool, isn't it?

326
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,713
Excuse me? Take a better look.

327
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,174
-Aren't I cool?
-Did you buy your souvenirs yet?

328
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,097
I told you not to tell anyone!
You already told Yutaka!

329
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,683
Huh? What did he say?

330
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,811
He offered to lend me money!

331
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,606
See? Isn't he a good guy?

332
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:35,320
I borrowed ¥20,000...
but really, keep this a secret!!

333
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,239
You're awfully chatty for a boy!

334
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,371
What was that?
How did her parents raise her?

335
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>The next day, we returned to Kochi</i>

336
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,546
<i>and I bought some candid shots</i>
<i>of Rikako from a friend.</i>

337
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,840
<i>I felt like getting even.</i>

338
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,427
<i>And I thought</i>
<i>that was it for my bad feelings.</i>

339
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:04,057
<i>But the following term,</i>
<i>we ended up in the same class.</i>

340
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
-Yumi, lunch!
-Okay!

341
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,531
<i>Rikako finally made a friend...</i>

342
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:26,329
<i>a quiet girl in the same class.</i>
<i>Her name was Yumi Kohama.</i>

343
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,540
<i>That was nice for her,</i>

344
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,669
<i>but the May vacation came,</i>
<i>and I still didn't have my money.</i>

345
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,839
<i>I thought she'd forgotten it.</i>

346
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,762
Taku, telephone! It's Yumi Kohama.

347
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,642
Is that you, Yumi?

348
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,146
Where are you calling from?

349
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,899
<i>You're the only person</i>
<i>I could think of to call!</i>

350
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,859
What's wrong?

351
00:28:56,317 --> 00:29:01,865
We were going to Osaka
for two nights for a concert.

352
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:07,203
Now we're at the airport,
and Rikako says she's going to Tokyo!

353
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,664
That was her plan all along!

354
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,751
She doesn't know I'm calling you.

355
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,793
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

356
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,881
She says there's no difference
where we go.

357
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,885
<i>Rikako even bought two tickets to Tokyo.</i>

358
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,138
<i>I don't want to lie to my mother!</i>

359
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,850
Look, calm down! You don't have to go!

360
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,353
Just leave and let Rikako go by herself.

361
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>I can't! Her mother let her go</i>
<i>because I'm with her!</i>

362
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,820
<i>She really wants me to go.</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>

363
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,447
What should you do?

364
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,659
Wait a minute! Why are you asking <i>me</i>?

365
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:51,915
She told me
you lent her the money for the tickets.

366
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,627
You're her friend. Can't you convince her?

367
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,799
Please come to the airport.
Our flight is at 11:30.

368
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,175
We've got 90 minutes.

369
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,011
<i>I really need you to come!</i>

370
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,765
That money again!

371
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,043
<i>So she didn't really lose her money.</i>
<i>It was a lie!</i>

372
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,713
<i>It was just part</i>
<i>of her plan for this trip!</i>

373
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,090
<i>What a jerk!</i>

374
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,223
KOCHI AIRPORT

375
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,775
Taku!

376
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,945
-You came!
-Where is she?

377
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,114
In the restroom.

378
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,659
Says she's not feeling well.

379
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:14,205
I wish she'd get worse.
Then we wouldn't have to go!

380
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,624
Anyway, she's way out of line!

381
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,212
You're her friend.
You should tell her off!

382
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:26,551
She really wants to see her father.
I feel sorry for her.

383
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,636
Her father?

384
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,771
What are you doing here?
Did Yumi call you?

385
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,734
Rikako, let's not lie about this trip!

386
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,485
Let's tell your mother.

387
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,779
She'd never let me go!

388
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,116
I've been planning this for so long.

389
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,206
Wait a minute. Okay, how about this?

390
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,961
Yumi, call home.
Say you feel sick and can't go.

391
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,921
But...

392
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,257
And Rikako's going by herself

393
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,720
because it would be a shame
to waste both tickets.

394
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,557
Your parents will worry only about you.

395
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,476
They won't think about Rikako.

396
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,980
You're right!
My mom doesn't know Rikako's mom.

397
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,149
She won't say anything.

398
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,943
Okay, fine.

399
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,569
I'll call her!

400
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,492
Yumi's from a strict family.

401
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:37,705
She's not going to run off
to Tokyo just like that.

402
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,382
So, you're not feeling well?

403
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,095
My period just started.
Sometimes it's really bad.

404
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,221
It must be tough.

405
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,307
Boys don't know what it's like.

406
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,144
Do you really have to go?

407
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,732
I'll get your money from Papa.
Don't worry, I'll pay you.

408
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:15,493
If you're worried about going alone,
shall I go with you?

409
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,121
Really? Would you really do that?

410
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,597
Hey, listen.

411
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,935
Your father knows you're coming, right?

412
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,937
Is he meeting you?

413
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,606
No, I doubt it.

414
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,444
Could he find a place for me to stay?

415
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,947
Sure, I'll ask him.

416
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,952
When I see Papa, I'm going to tell him.

417
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,999
I want to move back
to Tokyo and live with him.

418
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,962
<i>We are now on our final approach</i>
<i>to Haneda Airport.</i>

419
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,507
<i>As I followed Rikako around Tokyo,</i>
<i>I thought:</i>

420
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,595
<i>"She's done it to me again."</i>

421
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,932
<i>But I couldn't just let her go</i>
<i>to Tokyo by herself.</i>

422
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,850
SEIJŌ ACADEMY ENTRANCE

423
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,855
The cherry trees
around here are really nice.

424
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,483
This is the old part of town.

425
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:34,530
My grandparents used to live here.
This was all farmland.

426
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:40,036
They built apartments,
and we got the nicest one.

427
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,874
It was big, even for the four of us.
I bet Papa's lonely.

428
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,502
He'll be glad to see you.

429
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,510
It's good to be back.

430
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,560
Who is it?

431
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,523
<i>Isn't this the Mutos?</i>

432
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,525
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

433
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,860
Umm... is Papa home?

434
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,198
<i>Is that Rikako?</i>
<i>I'll come down, wait in the lobby!</i>

435
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,717
What a surprise!
I didn't know you were coming.

436
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,094
Are you alone?

437
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,554
My boyfriend, from Kochi.

438
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,598
It's the May break. We came to visit.

439
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,768
Oh really?
Thanks for looking after Rikako.

440
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,562
Shall we go for coffee?

441
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,065
I want to see my old room!
How does it look?

442
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,526
Okay, let's go upstairs.

443
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm sorry...
could you wait here for a little while?

444
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,241
Sure.

445
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,946
Taku, thanks for putting up with Rikako.

446
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,326
I hear you don't have a place to stay?
I made a reservation.

447
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,456
And Rikako owes you money.
Thank you very much.

448
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,259
<i>I really felt sorry for her...</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

449
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,345
CENTRAL GARDEN
TOKYO GOVERNMENT OFFICE, SHINJUKU

450
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,432
GUIDE TO WEST SHINJUKU

451
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,941
Hi, Mom?

452
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,945
<i>Taku? It's almost dinner time. Come home.</i>

453
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,864
Look, I can't make it tonight.

454
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,201
<i>Okay, we'll go ahead. Don't be too late.</i>

455
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,953
I'm in Tokyo.

456
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>Tokyo?! How did you get there?</i>

457
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,500
I took a plane straight to Tokyo.

458
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,417
<i>What?</i>

459
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm escorting someone.

460
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,463
<i>Escorting? Who?</i>

461
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,924
I'll be home in two days.

462
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,634
<i>What's going on?</i>

463
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,094
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

464
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,471
I'll explain later! Goodbye!

465
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,847
<i>Taku! Wait!</i>

466
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,062
Rikako!

467
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,025
What happened?

468
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,154
I'm staying here tonight. Papa's paying,

469
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,990
so I can if I want to.

470
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:06,909
Hey...

471
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:27,596
<i>The whole thing was starting to feel</i>
<i>like a bad soap opera.</i>

472
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,650
Want some beer, Rikako?

473
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:45,114
No? We drink it
sometimes when no one's around.

474
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,283
Make me a whiskey and Coke.

475
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,666
I tried it at a friend's house.

476
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,554
Papa's going on a trip
with his lady friend.

477
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,724
Well, it is the May break.

478
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,436
My room is completely changed!

479
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,730
The wallpaper's dark green!

480
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,274
I hate green!

481
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,277
You're right. Green's no good!

482
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,951
All the pots are fancy enamelware.
It's so stupid.

483
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,496
Nobody uses enamelware anymore!

484
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,166
Listen, Taku.

485
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,753
When my parents were fighting,
I thought Mama was wrong.

486
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:45,007
She wouldn't give in,
so Papa didn't either.

487
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,010
It ended in a bad divorce.

488
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,640
My brother and I had to move out
and leave all our friends.

489
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,018
I was on Papa's side.

490
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,397
But he wasn't on my side.

491
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,566
On your side? Wait...

492
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,443
My life is so sad.

493
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:12,284
Things must be tough,
but you should help your mother.

494
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,163
You shouldn't be living by yourself.

495
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,668
I didn't want to impose on Mama's family.

496
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,337
I wasn't mad at her.

497
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,880
Well, that's different.

498
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,674
It's none of your business.

499
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,645
<i>Good evening.</i>

500
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,774
<i>How are you spending the May break?</i>

501
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
Ouch!

502
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,520
<i>She's having a tough time? What about me?</i>

503
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,611
Taku!

504
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,113
Get up!

505
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:37,328
It's about time.
I was waiting to use the bathroom.

506
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,538
I had to go downstairs!

507
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,957
Sorry...

508
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,668
Could you leave for a while?

509
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,129
I'm meeting someone. I need to dress.

510
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,339
Your father?

511
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,926
A high school friend
I called this morning.

512
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,802
We're meeting downstairs.

513
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,304
That's great.

514
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,308
I need to shower and change.
Hurry up and leave.

515
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:09,443
<i>I think this was when I decided</i>
<i>to attend college in Tokyo.</i>

516
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:19,328
<i>Seeing Rikako bounce back</i>
<i>made me feel at ease here somehow.</i>

517
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,004
Good timing. My friend just called.
We're meeting in the lobby.

518
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,507
-Oh, really?
-See you, then!

519
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,845
What about the key? Are you going out?

520
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,889
No, I'll take a nap.

521
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,808
Really? Sorry!

522
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,643
Don't worry. Enjoy yourself.

523
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:43,978
Thanks.

524
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,581
Hello?

525
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,042
<i>Taku,</i>
<i>could you come down to the coffee shop?</i>

526
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,920
What happened? Forgot your wallet?

527
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,715
<i>Just come down! You're rescuing me.</i>

528
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,053
So, what is it this time?

529
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,641
Taku, over here!

530
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,020
It's the funniest story.

531
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,658
This is Taku Morisaki.

532
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,370
He was worried about me, so he came along.

533
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,165
Taku, this is Okada, my former classmate.

534
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,708
Hi.

535
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:53,505
Rikako, a boyfriend already? What a shock!

536
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,674
Look who's talking.

537
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,470
As soon as I left,
you got together with Ryoko.

538
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,181
I feel kind of betrayed!

539
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:06,352
But you're prettier. Ryoko says so too.

540
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,270
She says she can't compete.

541
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,730
Listen, Taku.

542
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,984
Wouldn't you be shocked?
I date Okada for a year

543
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:19,031
and two months after I leave,
he's dating a friend of mine!

544
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,991
Happens all the time.

545
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,245
Nothing surprises him either.

546
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,876
I called Ryoko. Are you free?

547
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:35,255
Why don't we all see a movie?
Like a double date.

548
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,718
I'd like to...

549
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,390
but Papa's treating me
to lunch this afternoon.

550
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:49,728
Too bad. If we'd known you were coming,
we could've made plans.

551
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,898
But your mother's not very fair.

552
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:58,404
She could've left you in Tokyo.
You're going to college here anyway.

553
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,700
She had to drag her children
off to the country.

554
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,539
What are you talking about?
She's not a child!

555
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,000
What's wrong, Taku?

556
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:17,005
You're a bore,
that's what! You and this guy both!

557
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:25,180
He must be jealous of me.
Sorry about that.

558
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,937
I was disappointed.

559
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:38,068
<i>In Kochi, Rikako seemed so strong,</i>
<i>but she gets to Tokyo</i>

560
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,363
<i>and all she does is put on a big show</i>
<i>and fawn over a stupid guy.</i>

561
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,369
Rikako?

562
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,253
Okada says to tell you he's not mad.

563
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,006
That guy's really dumb.

564
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,635
When we were dating,
I thought he was kind and thoughtful.

565
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,016
I called you because I wanted to show off.

566
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,352
Afterwards I just felt stupid.

567
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,315
We're really boring, the both of us.

568
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:21,320
Well, I can see you'd be shocked
about his new girlfriend.

569
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,739
You don't get it, Taku.

570
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:28,952
I was shocked
because he wasn't like I remembered.

571
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,247
All he talked about was himself.

572
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:37,669
He didn't even ask about Kochi.
But that's his real personality.

573
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,297
I just never noticed.

574
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,467
I'll stay at my aunt's tonight.

575
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,095
We shouldn't stay in the same room anyway.

576
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,473
Let's meet at the airport tomorrow.

577
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,479
Our Tokyo trip wasn't much fun, was it?

578
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:04,238
<i>In half an hour,</i>
<i>Rikako seemed to have grown up.</i>

579
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,869
Yumi, what's this?

580
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,371
Do you want one?

581
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,748
<i>After the break, Rikako ignored me</i>

582
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,752
<i>just as if nothing had happened.</i>

583
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,923
<i>As usual, her only friend was Yumi Kohama.</i>

584
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,652
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not worried about you,

585
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,488
but you're going to end up
without any friends.

586
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,991
Try to be a little more--

587
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,200
Leave me alone!

588
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,473
How were your finals?

589
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:18,812
Awful. I'm going to cram school
in Osaka this summer.

590
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,814
Training camp, huh?

591
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,691
It'll be a nice change.

592
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,696
-Listen...
-Huh?

593
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,240
Don't be upset...

594
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,620
but did you and Rikako
take a trip during the break?

595
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,915
Yeah, we did. How did you know?

596
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,170
How do you think?
The rumor's spread all over school.

597
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,505
Haven't you heard?

598
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,632
No, I haven't.

599
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,883
That's just like you.

600
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:53,472
Nobody wants to joke about it
to your face.

601
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,015
People are whispering.

602
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,393
Listen,
I don't know what people are saying.

603
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,646
Rikako just went to see her father.

604
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,731
Yeah, I heard.

605
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,984
Who told you? Yumi?

606
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:10,155
Yumi? Why her?
I heard it straight from Rikako.

607
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,453
I ran into her at the library
and asked her.

608
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,794
What, that story again?

609
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,173
Yes, I stayed with Taku in a Tokyo hotel!

610
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,592
What's that got to do with you?

611
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,224
I'm...

612
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,937
I'm in love with you.

613
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,943
Look...

614
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:52,656
I hate Kochi, and boys
who speak the Kochi dialect!

615
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,910
Don't say that to me! It makes me sick!

616
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,755
<i>Sick, huh?</i>

617
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,509
Yeah. It was kind of tough.

618
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,761
Is that what did your grades in?

619
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,306
I'll get back on track over summer.

620
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,517
Now she's gone too far!

621
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,147
Taku!

622
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,652
Red or white?

623
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,945
Red!

624
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,239
Red? You look better in white.

625
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,451
We need to talk. Come with me.

626
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,828
What?

627
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,966
What's the problem?

628
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,887
Don't talk to me in school!
People will notice.

629
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:02,392
You told Yutaka
we stayed in a hotel in Tokyo?

630
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,518
So what?

631
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,898
It was all your idea!
But people are pointing at me!

632
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,192
Why, you...

633
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:14,404
I'm suffering because of you.
You're the worst, you really are!

634
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,499
You're such a loyal friend! Satisfied?

635
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,842
<i>That trip to Tokyo really...</i>

636
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:40,514
<i>was a total disaster for both of us.</i>

637
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,943
<i>And so autumn came.</i>

638
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,497
<i>Rikako was as isolated as ever.</i>

639
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,585
<i>But her grades just got better and better.</i>

640
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:17,551
<i>Then, during the last event</i>
<i>of senior year, the school fair...</i>

641
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,306
Sanuki udon noodles!

642
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,226
She didn't come today either!

643
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,563
Probably won't come
to the dance performance.

644
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,857
She missed all the rehearsals.

645
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,024
Probably thinks it's stupid!

646
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:38,530
She skips group events
to raise her grades! Can you believe it?

647
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,741
Let's tell her off!

648
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,327
How about tomorrow? So, I will--

649
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,662
Excuse me.

650
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,038
Welcome!

651
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,375
<i>Announcement</i>
<i>from the Organizing Committee.</i>

652
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,086
<i>Today's final program is Dance Paradise.</i>

653
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:57,090
<i>Classes finished with the clean-up</i>
<i>should assemble in the courtyard.</i>

654
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,049
<i>I repeat:</i>

655
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:03,054
<i>classes finished with the clean-up</i>
<i>should assemble...</i>

656
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,766
Is that all? I'm in a hurry!

657
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,560
What? What did you say?

658
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,939
In a hurry?
Don't you care about class harmony?

659
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,569
Class harmony?
You sound like some stupid politician!

660
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,823
You're wrapped up in yourself.
What about the rest of the world?

661
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,827
What kind of world is this
where people can't think of themselves?

662
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,707
Does the world care about me?
I'll take care of myself!

663
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,794
You pretend you're not interested in boys,
but I see you flirting!

664
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,089
-Making eyes at Yanagida!
-Yanagida?

665
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,593
Who? I don't even know who he is!

666
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,847
Bring him here! I'll tell him I hate him!

667
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,061
Stop it!

668
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,688
You'll just hurt your school record.

669
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,943
No point crying
because of someone like this.

670
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,742
We won't forget this!

671
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,629
I think I expected too much from you.

672
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,475
Taku! How long have you been there?

673
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,230
I'm just throwing this out.
I heard voices.

674
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,901
Good for you.
You stood up to all those girls.

675
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,237
Even made one of them cry.

676
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,240
It was really impressive.

677
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,080
You idiot! You're the worst!

678
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,728
KŌCHI - EGGPLANTS

679
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,188
Hey!

680
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,904
Rikako just ran by.
I think she was crying.

681
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:31,745
Oh, she just got scolded
by the girls in our class.

682
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,663
She skipped all the activities.

683
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,752
But she really stood up to them.
They couldn't touch her.

684
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,172
That Rikako,
she's tough. It was really something.

685
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,466
You didn't stop them?

686
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:50,472
They'd have just told me to butt out.
They're fed up.

687
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,475
She can be a real pain.

688
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,689
You idiot!

689
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:23,505
<i>I figured Yutaka and I would</i>
<i>be back to normal the next day.</i>

690
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,216
<i>At least, that's what I thought.</i>

691
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:33,014
<i>But we graduated without speaking again.</i>

692
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:38,853
<i>Rikako enrolled at Kochi University,</i>
<i>Yutaka went to Kyoto</i>

693
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,273
<i>and I went to college in Tokyo.</i>

694
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:49,781
<i>We have just landed at Kochi Airport.</i>

695
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,876
KOCHI AIRPORT

696
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,802
Hey, Taku!

697
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,305
Yutaka!

698
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,687
Thanks for picking me up.

699
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,690
Sure. I got my license last month.

700
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,193
I'm impressed you found the time
to take lessons.

701
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,697
Took me a month to get used to Tokyo.

702
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,409
Another month for college,
and another for my job.

703
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,537
Before I knew it, summer came.

704
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,832
Tokyo and Kyoto are really different.

705
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,544
Kyoto's almost like Kochi.
I settled in right away.

706
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,134
But Kochi's nice. It's not crowded.

707
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:55,263
And everything you need is right at hand.

708
00:57:56,055 --> 00:58:00,768
Tokyo's got everything,
but it takes an hour to get anywhere.

709
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,939
Even Katsura Beach
is only an hour from here.

710
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,943
Jingu Stadium's an hour,
with train transfers.

711
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,778
An hour from Kyoto,

712
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,781
you can get to Osaka or Nara.

713
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,784
Gosh, sounds like Kyoto's better.

714
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,336
Want to come in?

715
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,840
I'll pass for today.
Your family must be waiting.

716
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,509
See you at the reunion?

717
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,052
All right.

718
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,725
I always wanted to apologize.
Sorry I punched you.

719
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,188
Ah, so that explains
the free ride from the airport!

720
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,776
I'll call you.

721
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,528
Want to take a walk?

722
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,572
It's been a while.

723
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,149
I was angry at the time

724
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,027
because I knew you were holding back
on my account.

725
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,158
I hadn't noticed until that moment...

726
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,663
that you really liked Rikako.

727
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:15,862
<i>Yutaka and I spent an hour there,</i>
<i>then we went home.</i>

728
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,325
PRIVATE PARTY

729
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,207
One more, please!

730
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,626
What are you saying?

731
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:33,588
You're living in Osaka? I'm close, Kobe!

732
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,839
-Have a drink!
-Thank you.

733
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,720
It's ridiculous!
I can't even resign from a club

734
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,556
unless the alumni approve.

735
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,018
So, I went to Disneyland with him.

736
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,562
We missed the last train.

737
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,521
What happened?

738
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:55,610
I thought I was joining a ski club,
not a religious group!

739
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:58,905
They keep calling me.
It's driving me nuts!

740
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,285
Better watch the drinking, Yamao.

741
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,623
She's late...

742
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,416
Late? Who?

743
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,585
She's late...

744
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,881
Scoot over more!

745
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,758
What's happening?

746
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,387
Yamamoto just confessed.

747
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,264
He always liked Nishimura!

748
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,475
Good for him.

749
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,396
We've got a new couple!

750
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,898
All right, cheers!

751
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,528
Time for me to confess too!

752
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,409
I've always had a thing for Yumi Kohama!

753
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,499
Well done, Yamao. That's the spirit.

754
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,544
-What did Yumi say?
-She's not here yet!

755
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,003
SAKAMOTO
TOSA CUISINE

756
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:01,884
From the start, she was always
in that flashy Rikako's shadow.

757
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:06,347
While you were mooning over Rikako,
I had my eye on Yumi.

758
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,224
What's that supposed to mean?

759
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,104
Come on, now.

760
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,524
Shall we go to the men's room?

761
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,069
Hey, Yamao! Are you okay?

762
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,080
Maybe Rikako's not coming after all.

763
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:38,379
Rikako said she regrets
the things she said to you.

764
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,839
What?

765
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,889
Well, he's passed out.

766
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,892
You're really looking good, Shimizu.

767
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,435
Thanks.

768
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:56,189
Of course, Rikako was always pretty,
but she's even prettier now.

769
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,401
Shimizu told me she saw Rikako.

770
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,279
Rikako's not here!

771
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:07,074
I ran into her yesterday,
in the department store.

772
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,911
I told her about the reunion

773
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:12,997
but she's probably flown home.

774
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,165
Flown?

775
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,338
Rikako went back to Tokyo?

776
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,175
Yeah.
I'd always thought she was in Kochi U.

777
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,679
She got into Kochi U to please her mother.

778
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,849
But she secretly applied
to a Tokyo school too.

779
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,977
When you met her, were you, like:

780
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:39,106
"Wow, it's great to see you"
and stuff like that?

781
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,775
How'd you know?

782
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:43,861
Well, I knew you never liked her!

783
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:48,866
You're right,
I never did. I really hated her.

784
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:53,371
But seeing her again
made me feel nostalgic.

785
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,624
It's kind of like changing seats.

786
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,127
When you're little
and have to sit next to someone you hate,

787
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,297
you don't even want to go to school.

788
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:07,760
The problem is, your world is too small.

789
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:12,306
If you have something other than school,
like piano lessons,

790
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,185
people you dislike aren't a problem.

791
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,813
Let's see. That means

792
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,818
you realize your world
was too small back then?

793
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,945
And that's why you went after Rikako?

794
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,574
We both had the same problem.

795
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:33,077
Rikako said her world
was really small, too.

796
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,622
HIZA TARŌ
RAMEN - GYŌZA

797
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,209
Oh, Yumi!

798
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,168
Yumi!

799
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,796
Hey, Yumi!

800
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,675
Yumi?

801
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,051
Huh?

802
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,431
Yu...Yumi?

803
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,892
Yumi!!

804
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,436
Come on, Yamao! Take it easy!

805
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,357
Yumi!!

806
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,453
Hey! Come on!

807
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,582
Yoo-hoo!

808
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,298
What? You saw Rikako too?

809
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,801
Yes. I wish Rikako had come.

810
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,555
-It felt like she was there.
-Me too.

811
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,307
That reminds me

812
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,935
she said there's someone in Tokyo
she wants to see.

813
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,271
But she didn't say who.

814
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,192
It's a guy who likes to sleep in bathtubs!

815
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:55,451
I'd forgotten just how pretty it was.

816
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:57,787
The castle!

817
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:11,092
<i>I always thought lighting up Kochi Castle</i>
<i>was a waste of electricity.</i>

818
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:15,513
<i>But with Rikako next to me,</i>
<i>it would have been beautiful.</i>

819
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:20,059
<i>There were so many things</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to her about.</i>

820
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,771
<i>I wanted us to see the castle together,</i>
<i>like this.</i>

821
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,565
<i>Taku! Could you lend me some money?</i>

822
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,652
<i>You sound like one of the teachers!</i>

823
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,029
<i>Are you a goody-goody?</i>

824
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,115
<i>I heard you were different.</i>

825
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:37,910
<i>I told you not to tell anyone!</i>
<i>You already told Yutaka!</i>

826
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,578
<i>You're awfully chatty for a boy!</i>

827
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:44,417
<i>My period just started.</i>
<i>Sometimes it's really bad.</i>

828
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,253
<i>When I see Papa, I'm going to tell him.</i>

829
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,673
<i>I want to move back</i>
<i>to Tokyo and live with him.</i>

830
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:55,553
<i>I'm staying here tonight.</i>
<i>Papa's paying, so I can if I want.</i>

831
01:06:55,636 --> 01:07:01,350
<i>My room was completely changed!</i>
<i>The wallpaper's dark green!</i>

832
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:06,272
<i>I was on Papa's side.</i>
<i>But he wasn't on my side.</i>

833
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,984
<i>My life is so sad.</i>
<i>We're really boring, the both of us.</i>

834
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,361
<i>Our Tokyo trip wasn't much fun, was it?</i>

835
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,156
<i>You're such a loyal friend! Satisfied?</i>

836
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,700
<i>You idiot! You're the worst!</i>

837
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,871
There's someone in Tokyo I want to see.

838
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:26,625
It's a guy who likes to sleep in bathtubs!

839
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,972
LON LON YANG BUILDING

840
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,781
<i>And that's when I knew</i>

841
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,075
<i>I'd always been crazy about her.</i>
