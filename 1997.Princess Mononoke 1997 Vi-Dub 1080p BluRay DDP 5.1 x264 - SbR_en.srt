1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:21,229
In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:27,611
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,924
Yakul!

4
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,847
Ashitaka!

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,601
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

6
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,936
We just came from Ji-san.

7
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,603
Ji-san?

8
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,188
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

9
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,357
-The birds have gone.
-The animals too.

10
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,112
I'll go check with Ji-san.
You three hurry back home.

11
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,027
Something's there.

12
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,201
Ji-san, did you see it too?

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,704
I did. It isn't human.

14
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,623
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,168
There. Look.

16
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,782
It's some kind of demon!

17
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,532
A demon?

18
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,721
Run, Yakul!

19
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,041
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

20
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,584
<i>Ashitaka!</i>

21
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,421
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

22
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
Yakul!

23
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,949
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!

24
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,829
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

25
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,347
-The monster!
-Come on!

26
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,267
Go back!

27
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,394
Leave our village alone!

28
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,396
Stop! Please!

29
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:18,902
Get up!

30
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,001
-He killed it!
-Ashitaka!

31
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,545
-Fetch the wise woman!
-Don't put the fire out yet.

32
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,340
Ashitaka!

33
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,429
Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.

34
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,516
Ashitaka is hurt!
Where is the wise woman?

35
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,310
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

36
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,895
What shall we do?

37
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,399
Take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.

38
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,233
All right.

39
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,791
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

40
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,752
I bow before you.

41
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,383
Where you have fallen we will raise
a mound and perform rites.

42
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,261
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

43
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,182
Disgusting little creatures,

44
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,104
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as I have suffered.

45
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,646
I'm afraid this is very bad.

46
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,650
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

47
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,821
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad, a poisonous hatred

48
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:14,952
that consumed his heart and flesh...
and turned him into a demon monster.

49
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,246
Prince Ashitaka?

50
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,373
Yes?

51
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,042
Show everyone your right arm.

52
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,510
Hii-sama!

53
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:36,808
My prince, are you prepared to learn
what fate the stones have foretold you?

54
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,725
Yes,

55
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,520
I was prepared the very moment
that I let my arrow fly.

56
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:47,110
The infection will spread,
cause you great pain and kill you.

57
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,033
Is there no way we can stop it?

58
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,453
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

59
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,789
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

60
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,084
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

61
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,588
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

62
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,173
Look at this.

63
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,178
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

64
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:20,268
It shattered his bones
and burned its way deep inside him.

65
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,230
This is what turned him into a demon.

66
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:29,110
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

67
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:33,948
It's your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

68
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,119
You may find a way to lift the curse.
You understand?

69
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:38,953
Yes.

70
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,040
We are the last of the Emishi.

71
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,211
It's 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe...

72
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,048
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

73
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,886
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

74
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,682
but our tribe's blood has grown thinner
and weaker with each generation.

75
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:05,271
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return?

76
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,608
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

77
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,836
Our laws forbid us
from watching you go, Ashitaka. Farewell.

78
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,951
Ashitaka!

79
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,245
Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

80
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,121
Do you think I care about that?

81
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,749
I came to give you this
so you won't forget your little sister.

82
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,506
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

83
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,550
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

84
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:21,222
Please, I want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.

85
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,558
Kaya, you know
I could never forget you.

86
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
A battle?

87
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,076
Move in!

88
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,872
Look! Up there, on the hill!

89
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,999
His head is mine!

90
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,844
Stop!

91
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,729
My arm! What's happening to me?

92
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,358
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

93
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,944
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

94
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,377
A demon.

95
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,559
The mark is getting bigger.

96
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,656
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

97
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,829
There he is now.

98
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,503
Will this be enough?

99
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,756
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.

100
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,133
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

101
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,178
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

102
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,642
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

103
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:59,398
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the
rice and take this nugget off your hands.

104
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,694
My good people, is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth?

105
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,946
No? All right.

106
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,366
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags of rice at least.

107
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,786
That's right, maybe even more.

108
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,120
Hey, wait a minute.

109
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,914
Give me my gold!

110
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,293
Hey! You can't just rush off now.

111
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,088
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

112
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,674
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.

113
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,929
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

114
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,642
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

115
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:42,107
I see you noticed we're being followed.
That's what we get for waving gold.

116
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,903
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

117
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,616
What to you say we give 'em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run?

118
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,129
So the demon monster
turned out to be a giant boar.

119
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:09,677
I followed its trail westward
through the mountains, but then--

120
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,345
You lost it. That's life.

121
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,138
See this place here?

122
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:19,645
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

123
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,149
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide. Everybody's dead.

124
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,446
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

125
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,951
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation. And nobody cares.

126
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,289
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

127
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,459
Ah, this is good!

128
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,048
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

129
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,885
<i>Samurai thugs.</i>
<i>You win some, you lose some.</i>

130
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,846
Hand me your bowl.

131
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,264
My point is, everybody dies.

132
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,975
Some now, some later.

133
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,728
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

134
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:05,274
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?

135
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,819
They're said to ride red elks.

136
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,489
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

137
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,416
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

138
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,669
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

139
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,213
Anyway, I've got
much bigger fish to fry.

140
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,384
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

141
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,890
Never have.

142
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:43,896
It was inside the giant boar.
I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.

143
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,951
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

144
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,953
It's where
the Forest Spirit dwells,

145
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,121
and it's very dangerous for humans.

146
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,790
To enter there is certain death.

147
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,416
The Forest Spirit?

148
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,669
I've been told the beasts there
are all giants,

149
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,546
just as they were in the dawn of time.

150
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,457
See ya there, my friend.

151
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,951
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

152
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,454
Coming this way!

153
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,788
Wolves!

154
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,883
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions!

155
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,926
Keep your powder dry.

156
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,429
Make sure you wait for them
to come within range!

157
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,813
Ready! And fire!

158
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,750
Second round! Fire!

159
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,717
That was it?
They weren't so big.

160
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,970
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.

161
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,145
It's Moro!

162
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,028
Come on.

163
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,127
We killed her!

164
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,588
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

165
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,306
She certainly did some damage.

166
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,808
We move out now.

167
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,643
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

168
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,562
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.

169
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,041
He's still breathing.

170
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,294
Hang on.

171
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,568
My name is Ashitaka! I have travelled
far from lands to the east.

172
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,322
Are you ancient gods, and have I come
to the realm of the Forest Spirit?

173
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,923
Go away.

174
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,862
A kodama! I never thought
I'd see one of them here.

175
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,742
Easy there. You don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?

176
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,043
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

177
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,212
But they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.

178
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,673
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?

179
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,760
No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer.

180
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,597
Where did it go?

181
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:02,190
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.

182
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,487
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest, little one?

183
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,126
Sir, I really think
we should turn around now.

184
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,920
No humans have ever made it
through these woods alive.

185
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,214
There's a lovely trail
back across the river.

186
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,009
The current's too swift
for us to get across,

187
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,721
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.

188
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,521
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost?

189
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,207
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

190
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,125
My God!
There's thousands of them.

191
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,982
Look at that. That must be their mother,
a fine old tree.

192
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,442
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.

193
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,528
This place must be
where the four of them live.

194
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,908
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn.
This is a place for gods and demons.

195
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,035
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.

196
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,132
More tracks?

197
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,475
Whatever made these
made them recently.

198
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,572
Sir! What's going on?

199
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,901
What just happened there?
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.

200
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,737
Here.

201
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,489
Did you see anything just then?

202
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,783
-Like what?
-Forget it.

203
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,787
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

204
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,706
Thank you.

205
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,880
It's gone,

206
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,720
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

207
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!

208
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,602
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.

209
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,570
Sir, you were right. We made it
back home just like you said!

210
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,062
It's a fortress.

211
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,314
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.

212
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,400
We make iron here
from the ore in the sand.

213
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,194
Hey!

214
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,238
Hey!

215
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,284
-Someone's come out of the woods.
-Is it the Wolf Girl?

216
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,580
Look! It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!

217
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,584
-It's Kohroku! He's alive!
-Kohroku's alive!

218
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,003
It's true! Kohroku's still alive!

219
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,588
Let's go see!

220
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,343
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

221
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,179
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku's come back from the dead!

222
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,347
What?

223
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,194
This is unbelievable.

224
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,280
-Where are the others, Kohroku?
-Yes, is my son with you?

225
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,366
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

226
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,871
It's never the guards that die.

227
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,331
Stand aside.

228
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,377
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

229
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,003
He's obviously an outsider.

230
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:46,219
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

231
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,096
You should be grateful to him.

232
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,975
Hey, watch the arm.

233
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,020
Sir. Hold it right there.

234
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,618
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

235
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,204
but something doesn't smell right.

236
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,875
You got back almost as fast as we did

237
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,170
and through the forbidden forest
with two badly injured men

238
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,589
-and you want me to believe--
-Kohroku! You're alive!

239
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,299
Toki!

240
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:28,845
That's just great!

241
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,765
How are you gonna drive the ox
now, all banged up and mangled?

242
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,183
But...

243
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,061
You scared me half to death.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

244
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,397
Then maybe
I could have found a real husband!

245
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,275
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

246
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,278
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

247
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,865
And as for you, Gonza,
a fine captain of the guard you are,

248
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,660
always strutting and throwing
your weight around once the danger's over.

249
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,746
You never do a lick
of work around here.

250
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,790
That's unfair and untrue.

251
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,335
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

252
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,506
Oh, good. I was starting to think I'd done
something wrong by bringing him back home.

253
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,639
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

254
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,973
Gonza?

255
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,145
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

256
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,271
Kohroku.

257
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,818
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.

258
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,571
Milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

259
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,281
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

260
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,867
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.

261
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,286
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

262
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,289
That's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

263
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,251
the wolves would have eaten everyone.

264
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,586
-So true!
-No mistake!

265
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,006
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

266
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,097
Hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

267
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,961
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

268
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,588
Just dish it out!

269
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,883
There he is!

270
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,509
Where is he?

271
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,887
Toki was right.

272
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,972
-He is handsome.
-But he's so young!

273
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,766
That never stopped you before.

274
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,686
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

275
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,980
Yeah, there's lots
of gorgeous men in here, honey!

276
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,065
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

277
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:51,029
Listen, stranger, come over to our place?
You don't want to stay in this old barn.

278
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,742
Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring
you the rice, so watch your mouth.

279
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,037
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice? Tell me that.

280
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,539
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

281
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,501
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
I would like to see where you work.

282
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,586
You would?

283
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,838
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

284
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,632
Lend me your lipstick.

285
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,594
-Don't forget now.
-We'll be waiting for you.

286
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,890
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

287
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,560
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

288
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,896
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

289
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,608
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

290
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,611
Women like that--It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

291
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,572
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract

292
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,282
of every brothel girl she can find.

293
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,451
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

294
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,495
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

295
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,707
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

296
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,710
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

297
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,630
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

298
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,798
Who's Nago?

299
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,635
"Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

300
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,680
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

301
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,016
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months.

302
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,895
See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

303
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,273
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain,

304
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,150
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

305
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:15,154
Before we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

306
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,198
and that's what made the boar angry.

307
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,633
He's feeling no pain.

308
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,639
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

309
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,752
Young man, what's wrong?

310
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,174
Is something
hurting your arm?

311
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,302
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

312
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,014
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

313
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,023
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting, stranger.

314
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,733
That's good iron.

315
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,861
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

316
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,824
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.

317
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,076
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,080
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

319
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,250
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

320
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,336
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

321
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,719
I believe
you'll recognize this.

322
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,515
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

323
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,683
rotted his flesh
and turned him into a monster.

324
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,312
I fought with him, and for that
I was cursed with this mark on my arm,

325
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,231
and soon it will kill me.

326
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,193
Where is it you come from? I've never
seen a red elk like that before.

327
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,447
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

328
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:25,576
Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

329
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,538
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

330
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,416
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

331
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,253
"Eyes unclouded"?

332
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,425
That explains it.

333
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,928
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

334
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,221
Is that wise, milady?

335
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,265
Gonza, take over for me.

336
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,120
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

337
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,081
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

338
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,716
Good evening.

339
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,601
We've only just finished it, milady.

340
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
It's still too heavy.

341
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,065
Perhaps if you didn't hold it
so delicately?

342
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,109
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

343
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:27,031
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

344
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,408
That'll be something to see.

345
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,246
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

346
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,456
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

347
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,460
These will kill forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

348
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,839
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

349
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,969
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard.
I'll have wine sent down later.

350
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,637
That'll be nice.

351
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:55,309
First you transform the boar into a demon.
Now you're making even deadlier weapons!

352
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,604
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

353
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,732
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,

354
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,694
and I'm sorry that you suffer.
I truly am.

355
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,614
That brainless pig. I'm the one
he should have put a curse on, not you.

356
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,343
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

357
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,346
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

358
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,932
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

359
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,060
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

360
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,898
Milady, Osa has something to say.

361
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:48,112
Forgive me, milady. You must not
make light of the boy's strength.

362
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,992
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

363
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,662
and grief and helplessness.

364
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:01,625
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

365
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:07,715
She is the only one who saw us
as human beings. We are lepers.

366
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,218
The world hates and fears us,

367
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,931
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

368
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,935
Osa?

369
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,689
Life is suffering. It is hard.

370
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:28,486
The world is cursed, but still,
you find reasons to keep living.

371
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,238
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

372
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,468
They just keep coming back.

373
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,846
Every night they're out there
planting trees,

374
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,890
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

375
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,352
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

376
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,730
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

377
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,899
Without that ancient god,
the animals here

378
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,318
would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

379
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,322
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

380
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,199
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world,

381
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,784
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

382
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,994
Princess Mononoke?

383
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,915
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

384
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,334
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

385
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,635
The legends say the blood of the Great
Forest's Spirit can heal anything.

386
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:40,141
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.
Might even be able to lift your curse.

387
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,145
Milady!
How does the action feel to you?

388
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,731
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing
for ruling the world.

389
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,817
It's still too heavy for the girls.

390
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,527
All right.

391
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,556
Well, look who's here.

392
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,975
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

393
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,894
Well, I guess so.

394
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,315
Excuse me. May I try it?

395
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,818
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

396
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,333
When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

397
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,335
Well, that won't be long.

398
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,588
Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

399
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,799
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

400
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,177
It's hard work, isn't it?

401
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,930
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

402
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,516
You must lead hard lives here.

403
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:08,229
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city?

404
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:12,066
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

405
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,984
I see.

406
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,614
-No!
-But you can't leave tomorrow.

407
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,949
Can't you stay a little longer?

408
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,701
You can stay and work here.

409
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,912
Thanks, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

410
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,628
She's here.

411
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,011
The wolves are coming.

412
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,385
Stop!

413
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,346
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

414
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,144
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

415
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,979
Somebody cut her off!

416
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,157
Keep stoking those fires!

417
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,493
Riflemen to the stockade.
We've got her right where we want her.

418
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,788
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!

419
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,665
Toki, she's on the roof.

420
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,543
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

421
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,295
Whatever happens,
we can't let those fires go out.

422
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,133
-Is she alone?
-Yes. We have her cornered.

423
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,427
You know she means
to kill you this time.

424
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,888
We'll see about that.
Come on.

425
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,401
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

426
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,029
If you seek revenge
for all the animals we've killed,

427
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:09,034
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

428
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,203
They want revenge
for husbands killed by your wolves.

429
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,831
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

430
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,717
There she is!

431
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,015
Everybody out of the way!
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

432
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,315
It's a trap. No! Wait!

433
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,319
Princess of the wolf gods!
Don't go down there!

434
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,529
Go back to the forest!

435
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,994
Don't throw your life away!

436
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,037
Shall I stop him?

437
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,373
Leave him be.
Let him do what he likes.

438
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,438
She's down! We got her!

439
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,023
Stay back.

440
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,942
Cut off a wolf's head,
and it still has the power to bite.

441
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,863
-Take aim where she falls.
-Right.

442
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:47,841
Open fire.

443
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,477
Stay back!

444
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,111
Wake up.

445
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,244
No!

446
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,641
-Skin her!
-Kill her, milady! Kill her!

447
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,934
Kill her!

448
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,856
Are you all right, sir?
Can I help you?

449
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,660
Get away from me!
Begone!

450
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,502
Traitor! You're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?

451
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,464
Stay back!

452
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,970
Step aside.

453
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,905
What do you think you're doing, boy?

454
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,824
The girl's life is now mine.

455
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,786
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

456
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,373
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

457
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,380
Look, everyone!

458
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,967
This is what hatred looks like. This is
what it does when it catches hold of you.

459
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,845
It's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!

460
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,848
Fear and anger
only make it grow faster.

461
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,934
I'm getting a little bored
of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

462
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,728
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

463
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,443
Lady Eboshi!

464
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,947
Someone come here
and take her from me.

465
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,993
Milady!

466
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,790
Don't worry. She's just stunned.
She'll be all right.

467
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,880
As for me, I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!

468
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,884
No, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!

469
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,263
Move and I fire!

470
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,069
Kiyo, what are you doing?

471
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,826
How can he still be walking?

472
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,876
-Is she all right?
-Yes, milady's safe, sir.

473
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,047
Someone bring me my gun!
Riflemen to the square now, on the double!

474
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,757
They're not getting
out of here alive!

475
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,927
Toki, come here.

476
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,892
What? What's happened?

477
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,617
Sir, I can't let you pass.

478
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,662
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.

479
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,667
Turn back, please.

480
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,004
We're grateful. You brought those men
back to us. We don't want to hurt you.

481
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:54,880
Please!

482
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,632
I walked in
through this gate this morning.

483
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,593
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

484
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,889
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

485
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,940
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

486
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,534
It's opening.

487
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,376
Out of the way!

488
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,590
The wolves are attacking!

489
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,758
Flint!

490
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,761
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!

491
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
Stay and I will bring her!

492
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,558
Come on, Yakul.

493
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,981
You have my thanks.

494
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,240
Good luck, stranger.

495
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,472
Stop it!

496
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,934
Leave him! He's mine!

497
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,074
His own people shot him.
He's dying.

498
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,081
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.

499
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,586
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

500
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,840
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

501
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,343
I knew that
from the first moment I saw you.

502
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,889
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

503
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,104
That woman is evil. There's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

504
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,565
No. Live.

505
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,276
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore!

506
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,697
You're beautiful.

507
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,787
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

508
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,134
The ape tribe.

509
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,890
Apes, how dare you show
such disrespect to the wolf clan.

510
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,060
This is our forest.

511
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,270
The human, give him to us.

512
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,774
Give us the human and go.

513
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,193
You go before my fangs find you.

514
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,278
We will not go.

515
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,656
We will eat the human.

516
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,199
We will eat the human.

517
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,368
Yes, let us eat the man creature.

518
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,664
Are you crazy? Just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

519
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,166
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

520
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:23,129
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

521
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,675
and we will drive the other humans away.
Give us the man creature.

522
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,304
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

523
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,932
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

524
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,433
something even worse than human.

525
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,896
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

526
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,066
The forest does not come back.

527
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,985
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

528
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,656
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

529
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,950
Keep planting trees
and someday we'll beat them.

530
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,496
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

531
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,958
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.

532
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,130
Enough! I'll bite
your head off, you chattering ape.

533
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,592
Stop!

534
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,978
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.

535
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:24,190
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

536
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,776
What about the elk?
Can we eat him?

537
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,074
No, you may not. Go home!

538
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,917
Come over here.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.

539
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,629
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

540
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:46,166
You're very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island, huh?

541
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,210
I smell like a human.

542
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,973
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

543
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,067
There he is.
Come and see. Hurry.

544
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,737
It's the Nightwalker.

545
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,739
Quick, you idiots.

546
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,702
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

547
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,413
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.

548
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,916
And you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the West.

549
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,794
Look. We've got a letter
of pardon from the emperor,

550
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,672
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the Great Forest Spirit.

551
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,306
The legends tell us
that when day becomes night,

552
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,142
the Forest Spirit
turns into the Nightwalker,

553
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,477
and at sunrise,
it changes back.

554
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,688
Look! See there?
It's happening.

555
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,522
Take a look, Master Jigo.

556
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,399
What is it?

557
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,693
Over there.

558
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,208
Look. There must be hundreds of them.

559
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,711
Those boars are not from this region.

560
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,171
They must've been traveling
for months to get here.

561
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,889
That one's Okkoto!

562
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,684
Can't be. They say he died 100 years ago.

563
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,811
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.

564
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,064
And it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe.

565
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:25,194
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!

566
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,793
Come on, you cowards!
Move! Quickly!

567
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,932
The bullet wound's gone.

568
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,485
Yakul.

569
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:15,263
You're awake. You should thank Yakul.
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

570
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,016
How'd you know his name's Yakul?

571
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,061
He told me, and he told me about you--

572
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,147
about your village,
your people and your forest.

573
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:29,610
The Forest Spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

574
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,907
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.

575
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,200
Eat this.

576
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:42,707
Chew.

577
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:16,133
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

578
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,177
Why are there humans here, Moro?

579
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,721
Humans are everywhere
these days.

580
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:26,435
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them
there. The girl is San, my daughter.

581
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,648
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

582
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:33,150
What is that other human
doing here?

583
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,570
He was shot, and then
the Great Spirit healed his wound.

584
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:37,822
This man is not our enemy!

585
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:43,411
The Forest Spirit saved him?
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

586
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,331
Why didn't he save Nago?

587
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,835
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?

588
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:55,172
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

589
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,968
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

590
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:03,639
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

591
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,766
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

592
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,563
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too,

593
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:14,859
carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

594
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:19,405
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.
I remain and contemplate my death.

595
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,365
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

596
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:24,702
I have lived long enough, San.

597
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:28,122
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

598
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,333
All these years you defended
the Forest Spirit! He must save you!

599
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,461
You are not fooling us.

600
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:36,964
Nago was beautiful and strong.
He would not have run from anything.

601
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,176
You wolves must have eaten him!

602
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,554
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

603
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,682
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

604
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,478
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

605
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:55,107
He had become some kind of demon.
One day he attacked our village.

606
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:59,195
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

607
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:09,205
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

608
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:13,709
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

609
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,715
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

610
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:28,099
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

611
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:33,938
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

612
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,148
Please, you mustn't eat him.

613
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:42,571
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?
I have heard of you.

614
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,574
You're blind.

615
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,078
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

616
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,579
It's all right, San.

617
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,292
My Lord Okkoto, what I said
about Nago's death was the truth.

618
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:12,059
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

619
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:18,524
I am only grieved and ashamed
that a demon has come from our tribe.

620
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,904
O mighty Lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

621
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:30,661
Leave this forest... for the next time
we meet I will have to kill you.

622
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,624
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

623
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:41,255
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

624
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,632
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

625
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,386
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

626
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:52,349
You'd risk everything on one last battle?
That's just what the humans want.

627
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:56,353
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

628
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:03,277
Even if every one of us dies, it will be
a battle the humans will never forget.

629
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,221
The Forest Spirit.

630
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,781
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

631
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,036
Get ready now.
Little bit closer.

632
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,413
Fire!

633
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,837
Reload! Fire!

634
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,012
Ready--

635
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,564
Well, I see somebody is going to have
to go play the peacemaker.

636
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,359
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

637
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,966
-There they are!
-Where?

638
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:55,431
The hunters are ready, sir.

639
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,474
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

640
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,353
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

641
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,443
Greetings, Jigo.

642
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,695
I've got the emperor
breathing down my neck,

643
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,197
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

644
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:16,368
And you'd have nothing to do with him
being here, now, would you?

645
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,580
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

646
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,999
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

647
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,876
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

648
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:27,504
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

649
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,507
Listen, the boars are gathering
for battle. You know what that means.

650
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,594
You made a promise.
Get me the head of the Forest Spirit,

651
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:37,473
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together.

652
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:41,143
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

653
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,443
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

654
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,653
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.

655
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,905
Yes, ma'am.

656
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,950
Welcome back, milady!

657
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:01,872
Whoa! Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?

658
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,506
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring
a message to you from my Lord Asano.

659
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,551
You have fought valiantly and well.

660
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,470
Now, open your gates
that we may speak with you.

661
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,473
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

662
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,434
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

663
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,770
And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

664
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,313
Well, you won't get it!

665
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:29,066
You ladies need to be taught some respect!

666
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,651
Respect? What's that?

667
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:34,530
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

668
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,242
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!

669
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,877
They are really something.

670
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,964
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

671
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:56,093
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

672
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,847
Impressive for a piece of paper.

673
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,725
Well, you know, it's gotten me
all the best hunters and trappers around.

674
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,812
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

675
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,023
Yes, milady, what is it?

676
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,734
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?

677
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,903
From the emperor himself.

678
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,322
-The emperor?
-Who's he?

679
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,867
-The <i>Mikado</i>.
-The <i>Mikado</i>?

680
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:23,162
Okay, you got me there.

681
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,038
-Thank you.
-Yes, milady.

682
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,418
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron,

683
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,128
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

684
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,297
My way,
there is no loss of life, Jigo.

685
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,592
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

686
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:40,637
When you needed riflemen, I sent them,
and without them, you lose Irontown.

687
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,724
I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

688
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,268
Don't tell me
the emperor believes...

689
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,812
that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's
head granting immortality.

690
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:53,066
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor
believes. I'm just a humble monk.

691
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,610
I'm just trying to get by.

692
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,404
I keep my promises.

693
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:01,867
We have fought the boars before. They're
easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.

694
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:06,622
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

695
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:11,418
So I've been found out.

696
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,879
Just one more thing, milady.

697
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,381
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

698
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,885
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

699
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,803
Came and went.

700
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,283
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

701
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,369
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

702
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,246
-They're killers.
-Killers?

703
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,998
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

704
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,750
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

705
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:55,170
What if it goes wrong
and we're stuck here? We can't help you.

706
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,005
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

707
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,884
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

708
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,263
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

709
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,725
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

710
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,395
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

711
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:13,146
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

712
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,857
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.

713
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,734
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

714
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,239
Remember, you can't trust men.

715
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:26,952
Don't worry about her ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

716
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,371
-That's what we're afraid of.
-What?

717
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,915
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

718
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,278
Do you suffer?

719
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:49,117
You know, you could always jump, boy.
End it all.

720
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:52,496
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

721
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:56,124
It feels like I must've been asleep
for weeks.

722
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,461
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

723
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:03,131
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

724
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:06,468
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

725
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:08,553
It's a beautiful forest.

726
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,514
Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

727
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,266
Yes, the boars are marching.

728
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,021
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

729
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:23,944
I listen to the forest's pain and feel
the ache of the bullet in my chest,

730
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,446
and I dream of the day

731
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:30,075
when I will finally crunch
that gun woman's head in my jaws.

732
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:34,204
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

733
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,123
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

734
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,792
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

735
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,461
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

736
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:44,965
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?

737
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:49,010
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

738
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,097
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

739
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,517
When the forest dies, so does she.

740
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,228
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

741
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:00,313
Silence, boy.

742
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,400
How dare you speak
to a god like that?

743
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,612
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

744
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,240
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

745
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:13,660
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

746
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:17,289
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

747
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,916
How could you help her?

748
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:24,629
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

749
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:31,803
How? Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

750
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,307
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

751
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:40,312
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

752
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,565
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

753
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:46,026
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

754
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,291
You're feeling all right?

755
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,797
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the Forest Spirit.

756
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,569
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

757
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,701
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak?

758
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:52,027
It's so quiet. I wonder
where the little kodama went.

759
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,453
I can smell the ironworks.

760
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:12,213
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!

761
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,301
Will you please give this
to San for me?

762
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,227
Let's go.

763
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,844
It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

764
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:04,683
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

765
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,809
It's that damn woman again.

766
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,070
She knows we're out here.

767
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:20,448
-It's a trap and a stupid one.
-What?

768
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:25,036
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

769
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,913
The humans are planning something.

770
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,041
Then we have to find Okkoto
while there's still time to stop him

771
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,001
or they'll be killed!

772
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,212
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

773
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:38,800
They may even know it's a trap.

774
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:41,511
The boars are a proud race.

775
01:25:42,178 --> 01:25:46,224
The last one left alive
will still be charging blindly forward.

776
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,689
Why chop the trees down?

777
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:54,649
To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

778
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,779
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

779
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,532
I must be his eyes.

780
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:04,159
You understand?

781
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,828
Do as you must.

782
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:11,124
You know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.

783
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,376
I hate him!
I hate all humans!

784
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,807
From Ashitaka for me?

785
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:32,562
Pretty.

786
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:35,106
You two, stay with San.

787
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,901
I must go to the Forest Spirit.

788
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,027
Let's go.

789
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:03,968
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

790
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,389
Thank you.

791
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,393
It's coming from Irontown.

792
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,317
Let's go!

793
01:28:46,196 --> 01:28:47,238
Who goes there?

794
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,531
Samurai again.

795
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:51,618
Halt, I said!

796
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,204
Out of the way!

797
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,263
What the devil
was that thing?

798
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,770
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.

799
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,147
-He's a dead man anyway.
-Cease fire!

800
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,589
Toki, come and look.

801
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,257
It can't be. It's Ashitaka.

802
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,342
So it's not a ghost.

803
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:51,678
Ashitaka!

804
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:52,804
Toki!

805
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:54,555
Are you all right?

806
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,015
We're all right.

807
01:29:56,182 --> 01:30:00,645
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try
and ambush us while our men were away.

808
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:04,232
-Thought we'd just roll over.
-But we showed them!

809
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,274
Where's Lady Eboshi?

810
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:09,988
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

811
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,073
We're cut off here. Can't
get a message to Lady Eboshi.

812
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,576
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.

813
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:18,287
Hey, sir, I've still
got your bow and arrows!

814
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,915
Aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?

815
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,583
-I do?
-You're useless.

816
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,836
Many thanks, Kohroku!

817
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,588
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

818
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:31,134
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

819
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:32,719
Bring back Lady Eboshi!

820
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,887
And don't take too long!

821
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,227
I missed.

822
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,271
They're bringing boats
across the river!

823
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:47,316
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

824
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,945
I'll be back! I promise!

825
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,992
Be careful!

826
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,621
Get him!
Stop that man!

827
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,550
Looks like they'll try
to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

828
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,512
Burning animal flesh.

829
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:04,894
Yakul!

830
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:44,892
Stay back!

831
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,657
Show me your wound.

832
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:04,162
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

833
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,624
I said, stay!

834
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,137
We're almost there,
my friend.

835
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:06,849
Who goes there?

836
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,937
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

837
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,648
All right, but I've just come
from Irontown.

838
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,484
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where she is.

839
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,945
The Eboshi woman's not here.

840
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:20,738
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.

841
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:23,574
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

842
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:27,411
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

843
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,830
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

844
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,791
We've been burying
our friends all day.

845
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:33,042
It was horrible.

846
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,711
-Irontown has come under attack.
-What?

847
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,382
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

848
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:40,675
We haven't got a lot of time.

849
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,093
Those samurai bastards.

850
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,595
Asano must've just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

851
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,806
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

852
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:49,642
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

853
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:51,602
Then someone's got
to stop her. Call her back.

854
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,605
If you're all done,
I want you out of here.

855
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,690
The rest of you, keep digging!

856
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,483
Wait! What about Irontown?

857
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,318
That's right! It's our home!

858
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:01,988
What do they expect us to do,
abandon Irontown?

859
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,699
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

860
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,450
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

861
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,704
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

862
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:12,707
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

863
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:16,002
Lady Eboshi
is just being used by Jigo.

864
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,922
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

865
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:22,300
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

866
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:25,886
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

867
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,972
She was there.
I saw her.

868
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,225
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

869
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:33,644
-What happened?
-I'm not sure!

870
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,605
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

871
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:39,984
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

872
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:42,194
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

873
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,488
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

874
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,543
Where's San?

875
01:36:43,672 --> 01:36:46,342
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.

876
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:53,182
There's a wolf over here!

877
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:54,850
Hey! Hurry!

878
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:00,272
Young master!

879
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,566
What do you think you're doing?

880
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:07,279
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

881
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,324
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

882
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,201
Stand aside!

883
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,539
What's more important? The head
of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?

884
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:18,416
Those darts are poison.

885
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,881
That's enough now!

886
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,515
I'm not gonna slave any longer!

887
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:37,852
Heave.

888
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:46,235
Look out!

889
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:00,958
After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

890
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:04,044
Be careful.
Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.

891
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:07,756
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

892
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:13,012
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

893
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:18,851
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

894
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:34,200
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

895
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,162
Sir.

896
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,206
Yes? Have you spotted them?

897
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,541
Okkoto's badly wounded.

898
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:45,252
He and the Wolf Girl are making their way
to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

899
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,298
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they? Keep after them,

900
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:52,510
but stay out of sight or you'll scare
the Forest Spirit away.

901
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,720
Yes, sir. I understand.

902
01:38:55,846 --> 01:38:58,599
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

903
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:01,727
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

904
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:13,280
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

905
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:32,216
What was that?

906
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:38,180
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

907
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:40,724
Something's out there.

908
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:43,852
What? With so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

909
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:49,775
I should have known it was you!

910
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,902
You did this!

911
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,071
Because of you, the forest will die!

912
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:55,823
You're wrong!

913
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:58,534
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?

914
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:00,786
You bring bad things!

915
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,539
Bad things coming,
neither human nor animal.

916
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:06,667
What do you mean,
"neither human nor animal"?

917
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:15,175
-They're coming!
-It's the end for us!

918
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,696
They're warriors.

919
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,701
They've come back.

920
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:47,958
My warriors! They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

921
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:57,092
Forward, my warriors!
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!

922
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:07,311
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

923
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,235
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

924
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:16,695
It's a trick!

925
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:23,160
It's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

926
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:29,541
Come out, Forest Spirit!

927
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:31,627
If you are truly master here,

928
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:35,506
give my warriors the power
to slay the humans and be victorious!

929
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,510
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

930
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,514
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

931
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:46,517
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

932
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:51,021
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

933
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:54,024
She'll know what to do.

934
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:58,070
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

935
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:00,739
Go on now.

936
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,760
Stay back or you die!

937
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:25,139
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

938
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:37,568
Ashitaka?

939
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:44,950
Get back!

940
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:56,420
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

941
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,256
You must fight it!

942
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:02,676
Don't let yourself become a demon!

943
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:06,138
Lord Okkoto!

944
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:09,892
What is it?

945
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:14,730
Is it San?

946
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:16,523
-She's in danger.
-Let's go.

947
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,470
I'm on fire.

948
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:56,522
No!

949
01:43:56,605 --> 01:43:59,775
I don't want to become a demon!
Please stop, Okkoto!

950
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:12,788
You're too slow! Get on!

951
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:28,804
A wolf!

952
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:32,391
Eboshi!

953
01:44:39,314 --> 01:44:40,983
You keep going!

954
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:44,444
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

955
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:45,904
Hold your fire!

956
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:46,989
What is it you want?

957
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,492
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

958
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,494
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

959
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,288
Forget about the Forest Spirit!

960
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:59,042
Your men are already heading back,
but they need you to lead them!

961
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,628
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

962
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:05,549
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

963
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:09,678
So we don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

964
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:14,349
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

965
01:45:16,894 --> 01:45:18,520
Just whose side is he on anyway?

966
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:19,771
Shouldn't we go back?

967
01:45:20,522 --> 01:45:25,777
The women are on their own now.
They can take care of themselves.

968
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,866
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

969
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,411
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

970
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,080
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

971
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:40,709
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

972
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,321
Moro, what happened to you?

973
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:12,199
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

974
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,409
San!

975
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,126
Ashitaka!

976
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:31,760
Okkoto?

977
01:46:40,018 --> 01:46:41,061
Leave, boy.

978
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:44,898
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

979
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:52,406
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

980
01:46:56,493 --> 01:47:00,330
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

981
01:47:01,123 --> 01:47:04,209
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

982
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:11,466
San!

983
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,434
Kill him!

984
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,024
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

985
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:52,466
San!

986
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:56,428
San!

987
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:00,766
Ashitaka!

988
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:06,104
San!

989
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:07,314
Ashitaka!

990
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:18,867
And here I was saving
the last of my strength

991
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:21,453
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

992
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,580
Close ranks!

993
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:43,642
Don't touch him.

994
01:48:43,725 --> 01:48:45,560
He's no longer a god.

995
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,780
You can't even speak,
can you?

996
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:02,494
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

997
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,414
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

998
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:15,882
It's him.

999
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,647
Give me back my daughter, demon.

1000
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,546
Ashitaka,

1001
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:57,007
can you save the girl you love?

1002
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:08,268
The Forest Spirit.

1003
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,447
Eboshi! Hold your fire!

1004
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:38,048
Eboshi!
Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.

1005
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,383
But that should have killed it.

1006
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:41,885
He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.

1007
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:52,771
San!

1008
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,241
Don't die.

1009
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:34,271
I don't get it. The Great Forest Spirit
took their lives away.

1010
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,543
Quick! He's starting to change.

1011
01:51:56,626 --> 01:51:58,211
Now watch closely, everyone.

1012
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,922
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

1013
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,633
a god of life and death.

1014
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:06,344
The trick is not to fear him.

1015
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,446
No! Stop!

1016
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:28,450
Eboshi!

1017
01:52:40,628 --> 01:52:43,340
You will die!

1018
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:55,685
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

1019
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:37,685
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

1020
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:41,272
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

1021
01:53:42,857 --> 01:53:46,444
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!

1022
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:52,700
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

1023
01:54:01,292 --> 01:54:02,919
Milady!

1024
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,422
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.

1025
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:09,592
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

1026
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:10,718
It's coming, sir!

1027
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:15,723
Run!

1028
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:33,616
Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

1029
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:35,076
Island? I can't swim!

1030
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,870
Then walk along the bottom.

1031
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:07,233
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

1032
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:10,487
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

1033
01:55:10,987 --> 01:55:12,030
Lady Eboshi.

1034
01:55:12,113 --> 01:55:13,406
Help me.

1035
01:55:17,368 --> 01:55:19,329
Don't waste your sympathy.

1036
01:55:20,121 --> 01:55:22,290
I promised Toki
that I'd bring you back to Irontown.

1037
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,466
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

1038
01:55:31,549 --> 01:55:32,592
San,

1039
01:55:33,134 --> 01:55:34,219
you have got to help us.

1040
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:36,930
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

1041
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,973
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

1042
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:44,145
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

1043
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:48,650
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

1044
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:51,694
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

1045
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:54,572
-San?
-Stay back!

1046
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:03,706
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

1047
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:14,884
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

1048
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:28,648
Nothing is over. The two of us are
still alive. Now, will you help me, San?

1049
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:56,467
Hey, wait! Come back! Help us!

1050
01:56:57,135 --> 01:56:59,429
A little crisis and they panic.

1051
01:57:03,016 --> 01:57:04,559
Whoa! What are you doing?

1052
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:11,774
Look! The head is moving!

1053
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:16,821
It's calling him to us!

1054
01:58:00,365 --> 01:58:02,325
-It shouldn't jam anymore.
-Thanks.

1055
01:58:02,951 --> 01:58:06,120
-It's awfully quiet.
-Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1056
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:10,416
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1057
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:12,877
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1058
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:15,588
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1059
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:20,468
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1060
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:24,931
-Hey, Kohroku!
-Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1061
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:38,236
-What's that?
-I don't know, but I don't like it.

1062
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:51,374
It's the Nightwalker!

1063
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:07,974
Everybody, hold your positions!

1064
01:59:08,516 --> 01:59:11,102
-Toki, it's coming right at us.
-Run! We've gotta go!

1065
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:15,314
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1066
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:23,698
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1067
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:30,079
Get everyone out!

1068
01:59:30,955 --> 01:59:33,708
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1069
01:59:34,417 --> 01:59:36,461
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1070
01:59:37,128 --> 01:59:39,714
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1071
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:43,885
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1072
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:48,347
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1073
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:51,225
-What are we gonna do now?
-It'll kill us all!

1074
01:59:51,309 --> 01:59:53,436
-We'll never get out now!
-That's enough!

1075
01:59:53,936 --> 01:59:55,813
Get everyone
down to the lake and stay calm.

1076
01:59:55,897 --> 01:59:58,024
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

1077
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:09,535
Not that way! Stop!

1078
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:27,887
Oh! There it goes!

1079
02:00:33,768 --> 02:00:34,811
We're done for!

1080
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:37,230
Once the forge burns,
it'll be the end of Irontown.

1081
02:00:38,106 --> 02:00:41,526
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1082
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:01,337
There they are!

1083
02:01:13,558 --> 02:01:14,517
Go!

1084
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,853
Stop right there!

1085
02:01:17,603 --> 02:01:20,648
Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1086
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,152
I'm giving the creature its head back.
Put the box down and back away.

1087
02:01:24,902 --> 02:01:27,280
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1088
02:01:27,655 --> 02:01:29,574
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1089
02:01:29,657 --> 02:01:33,244
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1090
02:01:33,327 --> 02:01:34,662
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1091
02:01:35,204 --> 02:01:37,039
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1092
02:01:37,415 --> 02:01:40,084
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1093
02:01:40,168 --> 02:01:42,044
But I might actually get it.

1094
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,880
Don't force me to kill you.

1095
02:01:45,631 --> 02:01:49,302
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to... relax!

1096
02:01:55,933 --> 02:01:57,101
Get going!

1097
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:17,496
Ashitaka!

1098
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:19,248
I got it!

1099
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:26,714
This is bad.

1100
02:02:29,717 --> 02:02:31,594
Master, we're surrounded!

1101
02:02:32,303 --> 02:02:34,889
-Come on, sun! Rise!
-Open the box!

1102
02:02:34,972 --> 02:02:37,016
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1103
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:40,019
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1104
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:41,979
Human hands must return it!

1105
02:02:44,273 --> 02:02:45,983
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1106
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:02,208
Forest Spirit!

1107
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:04,210
We give you back your head!

1108
02:03:05,086 --> 02:03:06,879
Take it and be at peace!

1109
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:19,725
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1110
02:03:51,048 --> 02:03:52,174
Well, I think it's over.

1111
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:53,467
It's the men.

1112
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:09,942
-Milady! You're here!
-Her ladyship has been injured.

1113
02:04:38,512 --> 02:04:40,514
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1114
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:48,481
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1115
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:59,135
I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1116
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:32,376
San. San, look.

1117
02:07:02,907 --> 02:07:05,910
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1118
02:07:06,827 --> 02:07:08,537
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1119
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:12,500
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1120
02:07:12,917 --> 02:07:15,586
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1121
02:07:16,086 --> 02:07:17,546
that it's time
for us both to live.

1122
02:07:26,263 --> 02:07:27,932
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1123
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:30,184
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1124
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:34,021
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1125
02:07:35,022 --> 02:07:36,023
I'll always be near.

1126
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:39,652
Yakul and I will come and visit you...
whenever we can, all right?

1127
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:55,459
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

1128
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:59,797
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1129
02:08:00,506 --> 02:08:04,510
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1130
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:08,764
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!

1131
02:13:12,568 --> 02:13:19,491
THE END
