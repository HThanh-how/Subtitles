1
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:18,013
With ten days off,
I figured you'd go abroad.

2
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,849
But you're off to Yamagata, right?

3
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,933
Yes.

4
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,268
Broke up with your boyfriend?

5
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,189
I just prefer the countryside.

6
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,815
-See ya!
-Bye!

7
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,983
Let's go to your place!

8
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,652
-No way.
-Why?

9
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,529
-Because...
-Later!

10
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,906
Did you get good grades?

11
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,117
No, but I don't care.

12
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,202
How come?

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,372
As soon as I get home,
we're traveling to Grandma's.

14
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,832
So I won't get yelled at for ages.

15
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,086
Lucky you! Are you going away too?

16
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,963
Yeah, to Nagano. How about you, Taeko?

17
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:52,964
I'm not sure.

18
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,675
My dad bought a summer home.

19
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,469
Wow... that's great.

20
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,307
Such a bad grade in math again.

21
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,894
But I got a "B" in science.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,106
Are we going away for the vacation?

23
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,357
Not really.

24
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,193
Take me someplace.

25
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,448
I'll take you to a movie.
How about "The Crane Lady"?

26
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,493
Not that. I mean to the country...

27
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,619
The country?

28
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,038
Like Grandma's country house.

29
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,623
Grandma lives with us.

30
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,126
-Grandpa's then...
-He's dead.

31
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,712
We don't have relatives
in the country, so don't ask.

32
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,971
<i>My family had lived in Tokyo</i>
<i>for generations.</i>

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,349
<i>I envied friends who had family</i>
<i>in the countryside.</i>

34
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
It's too late to book.
All hotels will be full.

35
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,482
But I really want to go...

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,444
-What about Onoya?
-Huh?

37
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,614
We're regulars. They'd have a room for us.

38
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,949
Where's that?

39
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,453
Good idea. Taeko's never been there.

40
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,746
That's right.

41
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,248
Is it in the mountains? By the sea?

42
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,125
It's in Atami.

43
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,919
Atami?

44
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,464
You get to ride the bullet train.

45
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,549
Sure, you'll love it.

46
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,471
Atami...

47
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,182
It's great!
Lots of different hot springs...

48
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,685
There's the huge Roman Bath.

49
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:34,608
And other little ones, like
the Swan Bath and the Violet Bath.

50
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,318
The beautiful Violet Bath!

51
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,653
The Violet Bath...

52
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,156
Oh yes. It's fantastic.

53
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,991
You love hot springs, right?

54
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,454
Since Father's working, you four go.

55
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:48,914
What?

56
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,044
Us?

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,337
Go too?

58
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,139
I'm amazed you show up every morning.

59
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,642
Everyone else has left town.

60
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,230
Aren't you going anywhere?

61
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,190
-Yes, I am.
-Where?

62
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,274
Atami.

63
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,736
Atami? What's in Atami?

64
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,404
Hot springs.

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,160
It's good timing.

66
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,831
We're going away next week
to visit relatives.

67
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,709
No one will be around for ages.

68
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,422
<i>Hello. Okajima residence.</i>

69
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,300
Nanako? It's Taeko.

70
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,596
I leave today. Any messages for
your husband's family?

71
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:52,143
<i>Not really. Just bring them something.</i>
<i>Maybe cookies.</i>

72
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,313
<i>Say it's from us and I'll pay you back.</i>

73
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,567
Don't worry about it. How's Mom?

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>She's out today.</i>

75
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,239
<i>She was mad you turned down</i>
<i>that guy's proposal.</i>

76
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,577
<i>"At 27, that's the best offer</i>
<i>she's going to get!"</i>

77
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,329
It's all she talks about.

78
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,333
<i>She's got a point.</i>
<i>You're not young anymore.</i>

79
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,626
Oh, yeah?

80
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>Definitely.</i>

81
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,672
<i>You've got to settle down eventually.</i>

82
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,302
<i>By the way, did you really work</i>
<i>in the fields last year?</i>

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,055
Yes, harvesting rice.
This year, I'm picking safflower.

84
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,140
<i>Safflower?</i>

85
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,227
Thanks to you, I finally have family
in the countryside.

86
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,731
So, I'm making the most of it!

87
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,900
<i>Give me a break!</i>

88
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,863
<i>Rather than stay in that old house,</i>

89
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,908
<i>why not treat yourself</i>
<i>to a fancy hotel for once?</i>

90
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,036
Maybe you'd meet a nice boy.

91
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,874
No way. You mean a hotel like Onoya?

92
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,208
<i>Onoya?</i>

93
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,463
<i>Not that again!</i>

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,966
<i>You've got to get over it.</i>

95
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>Let go of that baggage from the past!</i>

96
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,317
<i>My sisters, of course, would never go</i>
<i>to a place like Atami.</i>

97
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,363
Grandma...

98
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,240
Almost done?

99
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,077
Let's go to another bath.

100
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,579
We just went.

101
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,998
Only to the Swan Bath.

102
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,755
<i>Bored to tears, I went alone</i>
<i>to the Brothers Grimm Bath,</i>

103
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,758
<i>the Mermaid Bath, the Lemon Bath,</i>

104
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,762
<i>and the Violet Bath, one after the other.</i>

105
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,806
It's enormous!

106
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,768
<i>When I got to the Roman Bath,</i>
<i>my head was spinning.</i>

107
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,355
It's amazing...

108
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>And I fainted.</i>

109
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,662
<i>And with that, my trip was over.</i>

110
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,374
<i>Followed by endless weeks of vacation.</i>

111
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>Jump on both feet.</i>

112
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>Now your arms and legs.</i>

113
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:39,144
<i>The other day,</i>
<i>my sisters and I were reminiscing.</i>

114
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,024
<i>We couldn't stop laughing</i>

115
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,027
<i>as the memories came flooding back.</i>

116
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,908
Had one before?

117
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,577
No, it's my first time.

118
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,829
I'm the one who asked for it.

119
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,164
Yeah, we know.

120
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,041
Where did you buy it?

121
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,001
Senbikiya in Ginza.

122
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,461
Must have been expensive.

123
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,756
How do we eat it?

124
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,090
Slice it into rings.

125
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,091
But how?

126
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,678
I don't know.

127
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,099
Didn't you ask in the store?

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,523
We'll eat it next Sunday.

129
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,901
Why not now?

130
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,570
We don't know how.

131
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,325
I'll have a banana.

132
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,993
Me too.

133
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,793
Strange fruit they have
in those hot countries.

134
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,047
I'm home!

135
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
I know how to eat the pineapple!

136
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,842
Really?

137
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,973
I'll take that.

138
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,184
Mind your fingers.

139
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,144
Wouldn't a carving knife be best?

140
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,618
What a nice smell.

141
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,838
It smells so good.

142
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,758
I see.

143
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,511
Get plates. Quick.

144
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,763
Okay.

145
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,767
Let us eat.

146
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,914
It's chewy.

147
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,212
Nothing special.

148
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,214
Not so sweet.

149
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,341
Nothing like the canned stuff.

150
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,344
Live long enough and you see
lots of different things.

151
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,644
-You can have mine.
-Mine too.

152
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,884
It's delicious...

153
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,100
Don't force yourself.

154
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,226
You'll get a stomachache.

155
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,906
What a letdown.

156
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,911
Bananas taste much better.

157
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,287
You're so right.

158
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,457
Bananas are still the king of fruit.

159
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,708
I'll have one now.

160
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:40,677
<i>If you had to deceive me</i>

161
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:47,266
<i>I wish that you had deceived me</i>

162
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,604
<i>Until my death</i>

163
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>A red-ruby...</i>

164
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:01,155
The king of fruit is...

165
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,991
<i>the banana, after all.</i>

166
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,493
BEST SELLING PRODUCT

167
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,126
<i>The year I fainted at the baths</i>
<i>and had my first pineapple...</i>

168
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,381
<i>the Beatles came to Japan,</i>
<i>and started the rock 'n' roll band</i>

169
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,967
<i>and electric guitar craze.</i>

170
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,392
<i>My sister Nanako, a freshman</i>
<i>in art school, was up on all the trends.</i>

171
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,854
Yeah, the Beatles' lyrics are great.

172
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,981
<i>When she wore a mini-skirt,</i>

173
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:40,278
<i>she'd cover her bottom</i>
<i>going up the stairs.</i>

174
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,995
<i>My clever sister, Yaeko, was crazy</i>
<i>about some Takarazuka actress.</i>

175
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,413
Yaeko...

176
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,416
I told you to knock!

177
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>My sisters' memories</i>
<i>are mainly of fashion and pop trends.</i>

178
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:08,473
<i>For them, 1966 is the height of nostalgia.</i>

179
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,185
<i>Whereas I was only ten years old.</i>

180
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,273
<i>My favorite band had yet to debut...</i>

181
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:22,153
<i>My only memories are the back</i>
<i>and forth between school and home.</i>

182
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,946
Mine was pinned on the wall!

183
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,240
That's nice.

184
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,870
And it might be entered
in an essay contest.

185
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,414
The teacher said to take good care of it.

186
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,293
-I'd be so happy...
-You didn't finish lunch again.

187
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,588
Why do you hide the pickles
inside the bread?

188
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,632
'Cause I hate them.

189
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,094
I've got to throw it away. What a waste.

190
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,721
Such a picky eater!

191
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,058
I'd rather you were a good eater

192
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,728
than a good essay writer.

193
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,456
How can you drink that horrible stuff?

194
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:21,129
Milk's okay. It's onions I hate.

195
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,715
I'm leaving carrots so I've got no choice.

196
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:30,263
Who decided we can only leave one thing?

197
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,514
Shall I drink it?

198
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,723
Would you?

199
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,060
You'll eat my onions next time?

200
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,528
Thank you.

201
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,783
-Carrots?
-We're allowed one thing!

202
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,044
Two bowls is gross.

203
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,548
People who run in the hall

204
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:10,678
when the hall monitor says stop
should be punished.

205
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,390
How are you gonna do that?

206
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,184
They shouldn't do it.

207
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,477
That's right.

208
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,729
You might bump into someone.

209
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,108
If I bumped into you I'd bounce a mile!

210
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,234
Get lost!

211
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,402
Oof.

212
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,947
Running is no big deal.

213
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:30,990
I agree!

214
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,034
-Let's change the rule.
-But we already decided.

215
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,619
What's the big deal?

216
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,371
Raise your hand if you want to speak.

217
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,540
-Here!
-Miss Tani.

218
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,546
The hall monitor
should chase the offenders,

219
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,090
catch them and punish them.

220
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,509
-Me!
-Hey, me!

221
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,885
Mr. Suzuki.

222
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,098
Then the hall monitor
should also be punished for running.

223
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,391
He's right! He's right!

224
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,393
Way to go!

225
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,145
He's right.

226
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,647
Miss Tani.

227
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:07,860
The hall monitor
shouldn't be punished because...

228
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,658
it's like a policeman
chasing a speeding car.

229
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,083
Any objections?

230
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,003
A policeman?

231
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,380
No more running.

232
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:33,302
So, the hall monitor can chase offenders.

233
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,139
Any other issues?

234
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,432
Here.

235
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,392
Miss Tani.

236
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,103
-Her again.
-Busybody.

237
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,396
Be quiet.

238
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,898
Some people don't finish lunch.

239
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,861
I just read an article on the Vietnam War.

240
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,241
There are
many unfortunate people overseas.

241
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
We're very lucky.

242
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,703
Lucky to have you near me!

243
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,209
We should be grateful for our food.

244
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:10,339
We're allowed to leave
one thing on our plates,

245
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,216
but I think it's wrong!

246
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,430
Goody two-shoes.

247
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,685
-It can't hurt to leave one thing.
-Let's all leave milk...

248
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,896
-Give it to someone else...
-Of course.

249
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,859
-People hide leftovers in bread.
-That's cheating!

250
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,570
-I hate school food.
-Order!

251
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,905
If you want to speak, raise your hand!

252
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,326
What a revolting situation.

253
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,041
<i>That night in bed,</i>
<i>after chatting to my sisters,</i>

254
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,879
<i>more memories from fifth grade</i>

255
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,132
<i>came rushing back.</i>

256
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,890
<i>Our pet dog... School sports day...</i>

257
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,310
<i>Being scared by gross horror comics...</i>

258
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,439
<i>longing for an electric</i>
<i>pencil sharpener...</i>

259
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>So many little details,</i>
<i>one after the other...</i>

260
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,741
<i>playing in my head like a movie,</i>

261
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,744
<i>almost overpowering me.</i>

262
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,751
Is there a Miss Okajima here?

263
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,420
That's her.

264
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,008
-Show me!
-No!

265
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,686
Hirota in our class says he likes you.

266
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,692
Let's go.

267
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,614
We'll say we told you.

268
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,408
Hurry! Come on!

269
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,909
Told you.

270
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,625
Where is it?

271
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,710
Over there.

272
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,545
SHUJI HIROTA AND TAEKO OKAJIMA

273
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,296
It's true!

274
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,051
What's he like?

275
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,845
-No idea.
-Me, neither.

276
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,431
Taeko, you sure you don't know him?

277
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,016
No... of course not... Not at all.

278
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,190
Which one is Hirota?

279
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,817
It's the Room Five girls.

280
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,694
Hirota, they're looking for you.

281
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,157
Yes, I'm here!

282
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,869
Don't write silly things on the wall.

283
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,371
Taeko told us to tell you.

284
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,832
I didn't write anything.

285
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,586
You said you liked Okajima in Room Five.

286
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,879
You did.

287
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,380
So, we wrote it for you.

288
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,844
<i>I love you so much</i>

289
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,723
<i>But you're so far away</i>

290
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,184
<i>Like a distant star</i>

291
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,518
Goodbye.

292
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,354
<i>A far distant star</i>

293
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,485
Taeko!

294
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,489
We just went to see Hirota.

295
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,286
We told him not to write things on walls.

296
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,955
Tsuneko!

297
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,373
Ah, no running.

298
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,047
Aren't you glad?

299
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,599
FIFTH GRADE: ROOM FOUR

300
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,647
Wasn't it funny?

301
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,024
Over here.

302
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,194
See? That's him.

303
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,621
What? Hirota likes Taeko?

304
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,166
He's amazing. A real star.

305
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,085
You mean baseball?

306
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,546
Only Tono can hit his pitches.

307
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,798
Really?

308
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,718
Our team plays his in the next game.

309
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,562
Go, go, Hirota!

310
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,023
Go for it, Tono!

311
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,235
Hit it, Tono!

312
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,570
Kill it!

313
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,907
Go for it, Hirota!

314
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,412
Taeko's watching you!

315
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,548
Hit it, Tono!

316
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,685
Way to go, Hirota!

317
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,812
Strike him out!

318
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,232
Don't you dare cheer their side!

319
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,192
Of course not!

320
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

321
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,326
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

322
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,328
<i>Go, go, Tono!</i>

323
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,255
<i>Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!</i>

324
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,007
<i>Go Hirota!</i>

325
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,342
Hit it!

326
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,676
One leg stance!

327
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,472
Strike!

328
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,101
Strike!

329
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,564
Strike! You're out!

330
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,150
Wow!

331
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,447
Way to go, Hirota!

332
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,158
Way to go, Hirota!

333
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,787
<i>I knew nothing about baseball.</i>

334
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,498
<i>But even I could tell he was superb.</i>

335
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,134
Go, go, Hirota!

336
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,263
What's up, Taeko?

337
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:39,812
<i>Between the cold and the excitement,</i>
<i>I ran to the bathroom five times.</i>

338
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,647
Over here, over here!

339
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,731
Saved!

340
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,901
GIRLS' BATHROOM

341
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,945
Game!

342
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,909
Five to three. Room Four wins.

343
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,662
Thank you for the game.

344
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,998
You were great Hirota!

345
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,166
Good job.

346
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,001
You were amazing!

347
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,546
It was all your fault.

348
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,672
How come?

349
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,006
You don't know anything.

350
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,969
If Tono couldn't get a hit off him,
then how was I supposed to?

351
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,011
That's right.

352
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,933
You missed it and they scored three runs.

353
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,227
-That's not true.
-Good game.

354
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,147
Coach said he'd buy us ice cream.

355
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,648
-Really?
-Great!

356
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,485
Hirota, you should go see her.

357
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,028
Yeah, you should.

358
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,533
I'm going home.

359
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,828
What's the matter, Taeko?

360
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,625
Look, she left.

361
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,300
Um...

362
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,769
that stuff...

363
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:48,357
on the wall...

364
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,863
Rainy days or...

365
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,199
cloudy or sunny days...

366
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,535
which do you like best?

367
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,676
Cloudy.

368
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,427
Me too!

369
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,990
Rainy days or cloudy or sunny days.

370
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,493
Which do you like best?

371
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,288
Me too.

372
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,059
<i>I didn't intend</i>

373
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,854
<i>for ten-year-old me to come on this trip.</i>

374
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:40,779
<i>But somehow, once she showed up,</i>
<i>she wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

375
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,354
<i>But why fifth-grade me?</i>

376
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,279
<i>Second hour, all boys play baseball,</i>
<i>all girls to PE.</i>

377
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,698
<i>-How come?</i>
<i>-Baseball, great!</i>

378
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,161
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-Do we have to miss PE?</i>

379
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,005
<i>Today I'm going to talk</i>
<i>about something very important.</i>

380
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,177
You'll finish grade school,

381
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,182
then junior high, then high school.

382
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,643
Then become grown-ups and have babies.

383
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,647
A woman's body prepares to have babies.

384
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,366
Did you know?

385
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,409
Really?

386
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,538
Mom told me when I was in fourth grade,

387
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,665
since I'm precocious.

388
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:16,750
Precocious?

389
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,751
That's right.

390
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,798
She said tall girls or big girls
get their periods early.

391
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,176
I bet those other girls

392
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,220
already have theirs.

393
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,353
-Are you gonna buy them?
-I am.

394
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,437
I knew it.

395
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,564
You'll buy them too, right?

396
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,526
Well... yeah.

397
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,945
I think you should.

398
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,783
The nurse said
we all need them eventually.

399
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,410
That's true.

400
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,135
The girls are buying underpants
in the infirmary.

401
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,306
Did you know?

402
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,641
No.

403
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,351
But why?

404
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,604
How come you're buying underpants?

405
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,482
It's because...

406
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,525
Umm...

407
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,944
Why is the school selling underpants?

408
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,404
Are they for swimming?

409
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,240
GIRLS' BATHROOM

410
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,868
You told Nakayama?

411
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,036
Why did you do that?

412
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,038
You shouldn't tell boys.

413
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,624
It's supposed to be our secret.

414
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,799
It's because she likes him.

415
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,468
Did he ask you?

416
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,433
What's going on?

417
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,728
She told Nakayama about periods.

418
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,521
No!

419
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,025
He'll tell everyone.

420
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,526
I told you to keep it secret.

421
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,029
You trust him?

422
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,364
Right. Right.

423
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,827
-Oh no...
-Boys are disgusting.

424
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,330
Now they'll be looking up our skirts.

425
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,499
-Panties.
-Saved.

426
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,543
Pervert!

427
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:29,424
<i>Looking up skirts was all the rage</i>
<i>and periods became an obsession.</i>

428
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,010
You got your period!

429
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,514
Cut it out!

430
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,350
Second period break.

431
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,476
Idiot.

432
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,644
Ouch.

433
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,561
Come here!

434
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,482
You have your period.

435
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,566
No, I don't!

436
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,278
It's all Rie's fault.

437
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,035
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,286
What for?

439
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,830
For telling Nakayama.

440
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,207
It doesn't matter.

441
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,586
The nurse said it's very important.

442
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,797
I know.

443
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,175
They started when I was in fourth grade.

444
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,301
Really?

445
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,764
That's why I get to skip PE sometimes.

446
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,684
Having your periods lets you skip PE?

447
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,728
Mom said I should.

448
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,401
He even said he felt sorry for us.

449
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,112
You told him about skipping PE?

450
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,492
He promised not to tell the others.

451
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,035
Now they'll think

452
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,205
all girls who skip PE
are on their periods!

453
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,749
-You think so?
-Of course!

454
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,299
PLEASE EXCUSE TAEKO FROM GYM CLASS
BECAUSE OF HER COLD

455
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,425
PARENT-TEACHER CONTACT BOOK

456
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,723
I'm not missing PE.

457
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,560
Your cold will get worse.

458
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,145
Then I'll stay home.

459
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,480
No. You don't have a fever.

460
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,190
Then I'm going to PE.

461
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,483
Fine, go ahead.

462
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,320
Don't blame me if it gets worse.

463
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,908
See you later.

464
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,413
When did she become so fond of Phys Ed?

465
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
You're bright red.

466
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,506
She's right.

467
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,799
Are you okay?

468
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,967
I have a cold.

469
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,886
You have a fever.

470
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,304
You should skip PE.

471
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,805
Yeah, you should.

472
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,349
I'll go tell the teacher.

473
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,850
No, don't.

474
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,018
Why not?

475
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,729
Mom already wrote a note.

476
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,815
There's no problem then.

477
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,068
Right?

478
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,111
Out of the way!

479
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,072
Ouch!

480
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm missing PE too. Just like you.

481
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,631
They're so lucky.

482
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,051
I wish I could play, too.

483
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,890
Do you...

484
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,894
are you on your period?

485
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,354
Yes.

486
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,775
I'm not. I have a cold.

487
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,611
I know. You're sick.

488
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,197
Just sick. That's all.

489
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,367
Periods aren't a disease.

490
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,418
I could still play...

491
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,047
I'm gonna catch a period!

492
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,092
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

493
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,345
That was close. Almost caught it...

494
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,976
Over here, over here!

495
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,563
"Catch a period"!

496
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,860
What a silly thing to say.

497
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,572
It's no laughing matter!

498
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,452
Taeko?

00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,622
SHOES CONTAINER

500
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,544
It's the period pair!

501
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,004
No, we're not!

502
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,006
Stupid boys.

503
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,100
You're so relaxed about it.

504
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:54,147
Mom said it's nothing to be ashamed of.

505
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,649
I guess so, but...

506
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:05,325
<i>Like it or not,</i>
<i>a caterpillar must first...</i>

507
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,663
<i>live as a chrysalis</i>
<i>before it turns into a butterfly.</i>

508
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,260
<i>Maybe I remember those days because...</i>

509
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:28,389
<i>I am going</i>
<i>through a chrysalis phase once again.</i>

510
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,689
<i>Something definitely changed</i>
<i>when I started working.</i>

511
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:44,322
<i>At work and at play we girls were livelier</i>
<i>and more spirited than the guys.</i>

512
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,201
<i>It was like we'd finally found our wings.</i>

513
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,831
<i>But looking back now,</i>

514
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,334
<i>maybe we were</i>
<i>just flapping them pointlessly.</i>

515
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,092
<i>Perhaps fifth-grade me was tagging along</i>

516
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,345
<i>with a message for me to ponder</i>

517
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,431
<i>and to rethink my life.</i>

518
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:22,151
<i>Anyway, I decided to sleep</i>
<i>the rest of the way.</i>

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,366

ENTRANCE

523
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,545
Excuse me, has the Tokyo train left?

524
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,839
Was that your train?

525
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,840
No...

526
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,475
Taeko Okajima, right?

527
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,102
Yes, that's correct...

528
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,104
Thank goodness.

529
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,230
The car's this way.

530
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,317
Excuse me, but who are you?

531
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,444
You don't remember?

532
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,322
Of course you don't.

533
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,494
I'm Toshio. Kazuo's second cousin.

534
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,124
Oh, I see...

535
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,258
What's so funny?

536
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,512
Nothing. Sorry.

537
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:16,599
I thought you were trying to steal my bag.

538
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:23,564
That's terrible. Didn't I ask your name?

539
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,986
Yes, you did. I just thought... Sorry...

540
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,031
I beg your pardon.

541
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,157
No problem.

542
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,704
Where's Kazuo?

543
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,709
He asked me last night
to come pick you up.

544
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,211
It's been raining?

545
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,797
Yeah, but it'll clear today.

546
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,010
I should've used my dad's car.

547
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,180
But I like mine better.

548
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,644
It's a little tight.

549
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,745
May I leave it on?

550
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,496
Sure.

551
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,528
This is unusual music.

552
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,324
It's a Hungarian group.

553
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,868
Hungarian?

554
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,579
You know a lot about it?

555
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,248
A little. It's farmer's music.

556
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,917
I like it because I'm a farmer.

557
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,169
Cool.

558
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,046
Right?

559
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,532
Remember last year's party
at the farmhouse?

560
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,745
A bunch of guys turned up, right?

561
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,123
Maybe you don't remember.

562
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:51,754
They came to check out
the girl from Tokyo.

563
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,464
I was one of them.

564
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,260
Watch out, jerk!

565
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,481
I heard you're picking safflower.

566
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,943
Do you dye fabric?

567
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,529
No. I'm just curious.

568
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,157
Safflower's kind of unusual.

569
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,118
Well, maybe not for you.

570
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:27,832
It's known
as a famous local product but...

571
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,209
hardly anyone grows it.

572
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,712
Wasn't it big in the old days?

573
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,006
For the merchants, sure.

574
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,886
They got rich, but for farmers,
it was just another crop.

575
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,306
Do you know:

576
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,102
"I wonder whose skin in the future
This crimson flower will touch"

577
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,106
The famous Basho poem?
I read it before coming.

578
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,691
Is that so?

579
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,069
I only learned it last night.

580
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,284
I also read that the flower pickers

581
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:08,664
couldn't afford to wear
the rouge they made.

582
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,551
Is that where you had the barbecue?

583
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,596
There'll be another this year, too.

584
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,362
Are market reforms
making agriculture difficult?

585
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,489
Absolutely.

586
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,742
As things go, Japanese farming
might just collapse,

587
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,953
all of a sudden, one day.

588
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,038
But then again,

589
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:54,669
anything worth struggling for
will be hard work.

590
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,171
Isn't it the same in the city?

591
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:58,839
Yes.

592
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,802
But fewer people live for their work.

593
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,805
What about you?

594
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,099
Me?

595
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:15,398
I don't live for my job
but I don't hate it either.

596
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,444
I could farm 24 hours a day.

597
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,948
It's fascinating to raise living things.

598
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,909
You have livestock?

599
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:34,917
Not that. We've got some animals,

600
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,088
but I'm talking about rice, apples,
cherries. They're all living things.

601
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,051
If we take good care of them,

602
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,513
I feel like they'll do their best for us.

603
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,060
Listen to me preach.

604
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,314
Not at all. I get what you mean.

605
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:01,068
To tell the truth,
I used to work in an office.

606
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,530
I only just started farming.

607
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,783
Is that right?

608
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:13,164
That's why I'm so enthusiastic.
It's very important.

609
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,544
I quit work and joined
my friend's organic farm.

610
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,881
People said I'm nuts,
but I don't regret it.

611
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,508
Organic farm?

612
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,431
"Grown with no artificial chemicals
whatsoever."

613
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:35,227
Just blood, sweat and tears!

614
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,982
We use all natural stuff,
no pesticides or anything.

615
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:44,403
I've seen the labels: "No chemicals used".

616
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,782
But it's not just that.

617
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,368
We bring out the plant's life force.

618
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:55,873
It's cool... like lending nature a hand.

619
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,754
Sounds easy, but it's damn hard work.

620
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,264
I was told to take you
straight to the fields.

621
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,225
Yes, I'm starting right away.

622
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,685
Not going to rest?

623
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:22,191
Don't you pick the flowers early
while the thorns are still soft?

624
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,734
That's right, but...

625
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,696
I'm trying to become an early riser.

626
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,949
That's why I took the night train.

627
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,035
You're certainly eager.

628
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,064
There it is!

629
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,666
Good morning!

630
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,136
Great to have you back, Taeko.

631
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,930
Thanks for having me.

632
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,435
Grandma, you're looking well.

633
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,104
Welcome back, dear.

634
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,189
Aren't you tired?

635
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,691
No, not at all.

636
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,153
We made your bed just in case.

637
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,365
That's okay. Look, I'm raring to go!

638
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,452
Wearing work pants too!

639
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,331
That's all I brought.

640
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:47,586
Young people here don't wear them anymore.

641
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,090
You look like the real thing, Taeko.

642
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,342
That's right.

643
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,533
Taeko!

644
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,744
Don't!

645
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,170
<i>And so began</i>
<i>my second taste of country life.</i>

646
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:44,935
<i>How could this yellow flower</i>
<i>produce such a bright red?</i>

647
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,064
<i>They told me a sad tale from the old days.</i>

648
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,693
<i>The girls didn't have gloves,</i>

649
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:58,240
<i>and their bare hands</i>
<i>would get pricked by the thorns.</i>

650
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,619
<i>It was their blood</i>
<i>that made the red so deep.</i>

651
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:07,082
<i>I could imagine the resentment</i>

652
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:12,588
<i>they must've felt</i>
<i>toward the fancy city girls.</i>

653
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,969
<i>To make a handful of rouge</i>
<i>took nearly sixty baskets of petals.</i>

654
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:25,017
<i>This rouge was literally worth</i>
<i>its weight in gold.</i>

655
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:57,443
<i>The petals are washed, trodden,</i>
<i>then exposed to the air and the sun.</i>

656
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,155
<i>As the petals oxidize,</i>
<i>they gradually tum red.</i>

657
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,785
<i>After a few more days,</i>

658
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:10,622
<i>fermentation turns them bright red</i>
<i>and they become sticky.</i>

659
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:18,297
<i>Pounded, wrung into balls and sun-dried,</i>

660
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,965
<i>they finally become</i>

661
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,051
<i>the basic ingredient of rouge.</i>

662
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,643
<i>The liquid from the pressing</i>
<i>wasn't wasted either.</i>

663
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,397
<i>The red pigment in the yellow broth</i>

664
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,817
<i>was used to dye fabric.</i>

665
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,277
<i>Let's go dye our cloth.</i>

666
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,947
<i>Safflower do your best.</i>

667
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,283
<i>Cheer me up with your pretty color.</i>

668
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,787
<i>For those village girls, with no chance</i>
<i>of wearing make-up or kimonos,</i>

669
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,167
<i>safflower dye brought color</i>
<i>into their drab lives.</i>

670
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:04,843
<i>The yellow pigment dissolves in water</i>
<i>leaving the fabric a light pink.</i>

671
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,762
So pretty!

672
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:13,310
<i>Machines now take away some of the work,</i>

673
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,898
<i>but the petals still need</i>
<i>to be picked every day.</i>

674
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:49,846
<i>Rouge cakes soon go moldy,</i>
<i>and the flowers wait for no one.</i>

675
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:56,228
<i>No sooner are you done picking,</i>
<i>than they bloom again.</i>

676
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:04,736
<i>When the rains come,</i>
<i>work continues into the early hours.</i>

677
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>Each day flew by.</i>

678
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:15,163
<i>Pleasantly tired, I thought</i>
<i>about the flower pickers of old.</i>

679
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,961
<i>If I could've worked like this as a child,</i>

680
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:26,008
<i>my school essays</i>
<i>would've been really interesting.</i>

681
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,484
Mom, I need 5,000 yen.

682
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,029
5,000 yen? I can't give you that.

683
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,699
You said you'd buy me new sneakers.

684
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,285
Are they that expensive?

685
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,953
Nonsense.

686
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:55,954
They're Pumas.

687
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,957
-Pumas?
-It's a brand.

688
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:06,006
I'm not sure. There must be cheaper ones.

689
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,133
How about the ones you've got?

690
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,510
Nobody wears them now.

691
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,972
Everyone's getting Pumas.

692
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,265
Who's everyone?

693
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,478
Kako, Megu, Yachan, Nonchan.

694
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,438
That's only four people.

695
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:25,192
Everyone's wearing them!

696
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,820
No. You never do your chores.

697
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:32,866
Did you ask for a dress
for your Barbie doll again?

698
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,163
Didn't you promise to ask only
for Christmas and your birthday?

699
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,958
You always spoil her.

700
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,044
Is that right, Taeko?

701
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,965
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>the ten-year-old me was back.</i>

702
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,008
But...

703
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:55,097
Yaeko got a kimono
and it wasn't even her graduation.

704
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,015
It's for the tea ceremony.

705
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,811
You keep asking for lots of little stuff,

706
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,021
we get one or two big things.

707
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,731
-Right?
-Yep.

708
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,446
Stop that.

709
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,657
Always picky about food.

710
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,995
Dad loves the onions, right?

711
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:18,912
Yes.

712
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:24,251
Anyway, that kimono will be
yours in the end.

713
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:26,712
Always hand-me-downs.

714
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:30,674
-Some people don't get anything.
-Exactly.

715
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,802
Then give me that patent leather purse.

716
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,470
Didn't you give it to her yet?

717
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:39,307
You're too old for that. Give it to her.

718
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:48,567
I don't want it.

719
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,862
Keep the stupid purse.

720
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,700
Then I won't give it to you.

721
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,411
I'm not buying you a new one.

722
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,746
Fine.

723
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,666
Good. I actually really like it.

724
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,668
I hate it.

725
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:14,134
Ready for dinner. Take this away.

726
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,636
See, has to be thrown away.

727
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,472
What a waste.

728
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,476
Don't throw it away! Please, Mother.

729
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,685
It's your fault.

730
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,646
Finish it yourself next time.

731
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,026
You three are so selfish.

732
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:47,125
Father, buy me a patent leather purse.

733
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,588
Yaeko won't give me hers.

734
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,715
You said you didn't want it.

735
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,636
Yeah, but...

736
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,013
You said it, you have to live with it.

737
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,065
Hurry up and get ready.

738
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,487
I'll wear these!

739
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:20,951
Why is Yaeko coming?

740
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,832
You said it was just the three of us.

741
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:32,087
Because I finished my homework.
Is that a problem?

742
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,715
It's Chinese food. The more the merrier.

743
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,718
Grandma's not coming.

744
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,429
She doesn't eat greasy food.

745
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,015
If you don't want to come, stay here.

746
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,626
We're going, Taeko.

747
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,504
Come on, slowpoke.

748
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,551
I don't have a purse.

749
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,931
Lend her that patent leather one.

750
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,624
Here.

751
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,627
Ouch.

752
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,545
Let's go.

753
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,380
I'm not going.

754
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,925
Okay. Let's go, Mother.

755
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,677
Stay with Grandma then.

756
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,436
Not coming, Taeko?

757
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,063
No, I'm not.

758
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,415
We're off then.

759
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,927
I'm coming too!

760
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,941
No shoes!

761
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,990
Father, please.

762
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,641
A button came off.

763
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,906
We didn't go out, of course.

764
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,534
My face was swollen and a cold towel

765
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,578
didn't stop the stinging.

766
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,914
That night I couldn't sleep,

767
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,126
wondering why it was always me.

768
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,295
Figuring I must've been adopted,

769
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,340
I cried myself to sleep.

770
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,677
Was it the first time he hit you?

771
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:11,014
Yes, the first and only time.

772
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:17,645
Dad slaps me often... well, sometimes.

773
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,523
Maybe that's easier.

774
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,486
When it's only once,
you can't stop thinking why.

775
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:29,657
It's hard to imagine you
as a selfish brat.

776
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,952
A spoiled brat.

777
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,747
I wasn't just fussy about onions, either.

778
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,002
Now I don't feel like I'm that bad.

779
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,046
Wait a second!

780
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:47,759
Your poor mom. I shouldn't encourage you.

781
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,851
I'm giving up on the Pumas.

782
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,894
Good girl.

783
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,649
Maybe I'll slip you some pocket money.

784
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,900
Yay!

785
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,382
Hey!

786
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,010
100 yen each.

787
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,602
Taeko... Tomorrow...

788
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:43,314
Let's go for a drive to Zao.

789
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,275
-Zao?
-Yes.

790
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,528
You went to Yamadera last year, right?

791
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,738
The family said it was okay.

792
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,642
<i>The views at Zao were beautiful.</i>

793
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:24,314
<i>But Zao had become famous and touristy.</i>

794
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,696
How come you're not married?

795
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:36,034
Do you find that strange?

796
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,703
Well, no, not really.

797
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,956
Lots of women work now.

798
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,293
Most of my friends are single.

799
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,545
Oh, is that right?

800
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,796
That's right.

801
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,423
I see.

802
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,925
It's true.

803
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:53,801
Right.

804
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,221
Really. It's very common.

805
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,103
Toshio?

806
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,107
In elementary school,
could you divide fractions?

807
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,864
When they said reverse the numerator
and denominator, could you do it?

808
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,825
I don't remember.

809
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,120
I wasn't bad at math though.

810
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,747
I see.

811
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,082
Lucky you.

812
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,918
I bet you don't remember
because it was easy.

813
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,255
Maybe. Why do you ask?

814
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,675
It seems that people who could do it

815
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,261
went on to have easy lives.

816
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:43,393
One girl, completely average...
not even good at math,

817
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,813
always could do it perfect right away.

818
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,941
She grew up really normal

819
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,194
and now is married with two kids.

820
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:58,658
I was no good at it.

821
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,953
Not smart enough to know when to quit.

822
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:10,545
ROOM FIVE, TAEKO OKAJIMA, 25 POINTS

823
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,431
Before the test...

824
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:27,395
we had art class.

825
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:32,358
And... um... we did blow pictures.

826
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,110
Blow pictures?

827
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:38,948
Yes. We drop paint on the paper...

828
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,328
and blow patterns in it.

829
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:45,830
And?

830
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:51,169
You blow like this, really hard, right?

831
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,004
Yes?

832
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:59,093
So, I got a headache.
From blowing so hard.

833
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,638
That's why you did so badly?

834
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,390
That's right.

835
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,143
I see.

836
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,652
Do you know the answers now?

837
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,029
The correct answers?

838
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,785
Have Yaeko help you with them.

839
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,578
Yaeko?

840
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,038
That's right.

841
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,832
Or Nanako, whichever.

842
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,879
I'll ask Nanako.

843
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:00,905
Nanako's not back yet.
Can I wait till after dinner?

844
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,834
I'll ask Yaeko...

845
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,269
Mother!

846
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,896
Mother! Mother!

847
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,817
What is this?

848
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,902
How on earth...

849
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:43,823
Please teach her.
She doesn't seem to get it.

850
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,120
But this is beyond belief!

851
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,872
That's why I'm asking you.

852
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,915
Is she alright in the head?

853
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,418
Just help her.

854
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,962
Normally this is easy.

855
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,006
But that child's not normal!

856
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,775
Taeko, your sister's going to help.

857
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:24,697
You had a headache from blowing,
didn't you?

858
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,243
Sit.

859
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,417
Say your times table from the top.

860
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,629
I know that. I'm in fifth grade already!

861
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,090
Then why so many mistakes?

862
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,718
It's dividing fractions.

863
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:57,104
Just flip the top
and the bottom and multiply.

864
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,273
They taught you that, right?

865
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,152
Then why do you get it wrong?

866
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:06,364
Yaeko, one step at a time.

867
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:14,413
What's dividing a fraction
by a fraction anyway?

868
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:25,216
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter means...

869
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,971
how this would be divided

870
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,889
among four people, right?

871
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:40,815
So, it's one, two, three,
four, five, six...

872
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,733
one-sixth each, right?

873
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,822
No, no, no, no. That's multiplication.

874
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:52,243
How come it's less when you multiply?

875
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,955
Two-thirds of an apple
divided by a quarter...

876
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:00,793
Anyway!

877
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,006
Forget about apples.

878
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:09,343
Just remember to invert and multiply.

879
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,187
Is her sister in Takarazuka?

880
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,272
No, S.K.D.

881
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,985
-She got a "D" in math.
-A "D"?

882
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,863
Yes, and just barely.

883
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:35,244
If she got half right,
it'd be worth scolding her.

884
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,787
Right.

885
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,541
Should you get her IQ checked?

886
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,544
They said it was fine when she started.

887
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:45,338
Maybe she turned dumb?

888
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,299
Remember she fell down
the stairs as a baby?

889
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,801
Right, in her walker!

890
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,220
I thought she was dead.

891
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,306
It was just a bump.

892
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,891
It's affecting her now.

893
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,101
That's it!

894
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:03,439
<i>Nonsense. She's just no good at math.</i>

895
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:06,484
<i>She chats too much in class.</i>

896
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:11,030
<i>If she'd just listen...</i>
<i>Even an idiot can do it.</i>

897
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:15,451
<i>Only two more years until junior high.</i>

898
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:19,497
Two-thirds of this apple,

899
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:24,460
divided by a quarter...
I can't even picture it.

900
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,754
Two-thirds of this,

901
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:31,550
into a quarter makes it...

902
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:42,520
Even now, dividing fractions is difficult.

903
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:52,780
We farmers give up too easily.

904
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:57,785
We just yield to the flow
and follow what they do in the cities.

905
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,080
Let's rethink
the real meaning of prosperity.

906
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,750
Return to the old ways of farming.

907
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,753
You made me jump...

908
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,591
So, that explains the organic farming?

909
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,432
I'm just quoting my friend.

910
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,727
But I agree with it.

911
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:28,607
It's great the way you hold
onto your memories of math class.

912
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,736
It wasn't meant to impress you.

913
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:37,116
People say you work in a great place,

914
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,244
but I could never give myself
up to it completely.

915
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:46,792
I really admire your devotion to farming.

916
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,130
You're being sarcastic?

917
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,175
Of course not!

918
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,635
There aren't many people like you.

919
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,559
Farming's in total decline, right?

920
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:08,522
So we can't just carry on as normal.

921
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,983
We've got to think about the future.

922
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:16,447
We help each other out,
cheer one another along,

923
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,157
otherwise we can't keep it up.

924
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,915
Taeko, do you ski?

925
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,169
I've been with friends a few times.

926
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,381
Come next winter. I'll teach you.

927
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,675
Are you good?

928
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:41,430
I'm not too bad.
But I'm an instructor here.

929
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,809
An instructor? You must be great.

930
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,312
All my friends are too.

931
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,799
At last, we're in the middle of nowhere.

932
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,010
"Nowhere", huh?

933
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:22,972
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

934
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,766
Interesting point though.

935
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:32,148
City people see the trees and rivers

936
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,859
and are grateful for "nature".

937
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:40,614
But what you see here is all made by man.

938
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,616
By man?

939
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,243
Farmers.

940
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,875
-That wood?
-Yes.

941
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,085
-Those trees?
-Yes.

942
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,754
-That stream?
-Yes.

943
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:00,551
Every bit has its history,
not just the fields and rice paddies,

944
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:04,054
someone's great-great-grandpa
planted it, or cleared it,

945
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,183
gathered firewood
or picked mushrooms there.

946
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,727
I see.

947
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:15,482
Mankind battles nature
and gets stuff from it.

948
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:18,194
They evolve together,
and it created this scenery.

949
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:23,032
So without man, this wouldn't exist?

950
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:28,829
Farmers can't exist without nature.

951
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:34,210
So they've always taken great care

952
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,754
to give her a helping hand in return.

953
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:43,177
A collaboration between man and nature...

954
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,055
That's the heart of country life.

955
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:51,393
That's why I feel so at home.

956
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,647
I didn't grow up here,
but somehow always felt...

957
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:59,360
my soul was at home here.

958
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,240
So that's it...

959
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:56,000
My back aches.

960
01:19:57,084 --> 01:20:00,838
What's so great about organic farming?

961
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:06,844
Only the theory. Like I said...

962
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:10,347
giving nature a hand is hard work.

963
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,851
Things haven't changed in a hundred years.

964
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,772
No, even "organic" rice uses weed killer.

965
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:23,610
There's not enough labor to weed by hand.

966
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,866
You're really working hard.

967
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,785
How about some tea?

968
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,246
Fantastic.

969
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,999
I felt like having a break.

970
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:49,470
<i>Toshio let me try a variety of things...</i>

971
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:55,059
<i>until I felt I knew</i>
<i>all about country life.</i>

972
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:25,672
How wonderful.

973
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:49,363
"Behold, the crows fly home. First one..."

974
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:54,910
At last I can say this
in the right setting.

975
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,917
It was my line in a school play.

976
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,044
I was "Village Child A".

977
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,588
Oh, I see.

978
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:11,385
I only ever had small roles too.

979
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,678
And you, Naoko?

980
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:18,016
Only lead roles,
since there are so few of us.

981
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:23,105
These days people leave
and go to the cities.

982
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:27,568
And now there are fewer kids.

983
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:32,781
I see. But getting
the big roles must be fun.

984
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:38,328
Not really. I prefer sports.
I'm a pretty fast runner.

985
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:42,499
Good for you. I was always mediocre.

986
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,668
The sports version of "Village Child A".

987
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,923
Still, I'll never forget that line
as long as I live.

988
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:54,803
It was going to make me a star.

989
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:55,971
A star?

990
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,055
Yes.

991
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,348
What kind of star?

992
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,600
That tiny role?

993
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,143
Yes.

994
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,854
Even though you weren't the lead?

995
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,357
Yes. Because I was the most enthusiastic.

996
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,611
'Cause you were the cutest?

997
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,030
No, not that!

998
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,617
I rehearsed endlessly
in front of the mirror.

999
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,995
Even for "Village Child A"...

1000
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:25,918
The line was so short,
I felt something was missing.

1001
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:31,298
"Behold, the crows fly home. First one..."

1002
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,592
I know. You made up more!

1003
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,344
Exactly.

1004
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:42,851
Look up there, the crows fly home.

1005
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,772
-First one...
-Then two...

1006
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,857
-Then three...
-Then four...

1007
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,820
Farewell, dear crows. You take care now.

1008
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,452
<i>-And your teacher loved it.</i>
<i>-Just the opposite.</i>

1009
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,955
Very good everyone.

1010
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:08,627
But let's stick to the script.

1011
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,474
<i>After all that.</i>

1012
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,687
<i>It wasn't a good line, so I didn't mind.</i>

1013
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:30,232
<i>I wasn't discouraged at all.</i>

1014
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:35,529
<i>I realized that I could act</i>
<i>even when there were no lines.</i>

1015
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,829
Behold, the crows fly home.

1016
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,378
-First one.
-Then two.

1017
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,505
-Then three.
-Then four.

1018
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,445
That was all.

1019
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:22,492
It was worth the effort.
"Village Child A" was a hit.

1020
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,411
Believe it or not.

1021
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,665
People asked if I'd had lessons.

1022
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:31,418
Teachers praised me...

1023
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,297
Then something amazing happened.

1024
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,302
Anyone home?

1025
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:41,511
Coming.

1026
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:46,933
<i>And then the dynamite blew up</i>
<i>right in my face!</i>

1027
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,477
Right in my face!

1028
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,937
What? Our Taeko?

1029
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,565
Yes, but--

1030
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,071
We need a girl to star
in our college play.

1031
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:05,160
As a service to the community,

1032
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:08,205
please let your daughter perform.

1033
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,498
A star!

1034
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,460
We'd rehearse Saturday afternoons.

1035
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,546
We wouldn't take too long.

1036
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,049
Well, but...

1037
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,969
Of course we'd bring her straight home.

1038
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,222
I'll be in a real play.

1039
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:29,434
Not with a bunch of kids
but with real grown-ups!

1040
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,228
I'll be a star!

1041
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,399
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1042
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:40,278
<i>What a wonderful day</i>

1043
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:47,035
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1044
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,247
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1045
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,376
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

1046
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,717
Mother!

1047
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:03,885
So? So?

1048
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:07,889
A nice boy from the university
wants you in their drama.

1049
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:11,560
You were so good in the school play.

1050
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,478
And? And?

1051
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:18,483
He practically begged me!

1052
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:28,118
Wow, that's great!

1053
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,412
At least you're good at something.

1054
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,248
She writes good essays too.

1055
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:38,128
She's certainly better at that
than she is at math.

1056
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,297
That's right. That's right.

1057
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,635
I was the lead in "The Poor Sparrow"
but no one came to see me.

1058
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,596
You see, you see!

1059
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,973
Are you going to do it?

1060
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,666
This could lead to a career.

1061
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,003
Join the Takarazuka Revue!

1062
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,256
Start rehearsing now, it's perfect timing.

1063
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,176
Acting is out.

1064
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,054
Show business people are no good.

1065
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:34,142
"Show business"... Don't exaggerate...

1066
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,561
That's right. It's...

1067
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:37,771
I said no.

1068
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,148
Dinner.

1069
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,420
Father's so stubborn.

1070
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:06,591
Why did you have to mention a career?

1071
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,594
-Can I bathe first?
-Sure.

1072
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,556
Or Takarazuka?

1073
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,643
Or show business? You know Dad...

1074
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,147
Why did you say that, Nanako?

1075
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,108
That's enough.

1076
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:33,869
<i>Poor boy, poor boy</i>

1077
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,372
<i>Don't you feel sorry for me?</i>

1078
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,709
We won't take much of her time.

1079
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,336
I know, but...

1080
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,590
I beg you.

1081
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:51,177
She's rather shy...

1082
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,515
The timid type...

1083
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:02,314
Sorry you came so far for nothing.

1084
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:07,569
<i>Poor boy, poor boy</i>

1085
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:12,115
<i>Such a long way from home</i>

1086
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:17,370
<i>Poor boy</i>

1087
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:31,551
Aoki's going to play the part instead.

1088
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:33,219
I see.

1089
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:38,558
She's boasting to everyone.

1090
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:39,768
I see.

1091
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:43,063
Today her mom met her at school

1092
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:47,651
to get her changed into a fancy dress.

1093
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,278
A frilly thing out to here...

1094
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,279
Taeko?

1095
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:57,952
Don't tell anyone you got the first offer.

1096
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:04,209
Because that would hurt Aoki very much.

1097
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,340
Do you understand?

1098
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:14,552
Do you understand?

1099
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,294
<i>Breaking through the waves</i>

1100
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,633
<i>Shooting through the clouds</i>

1101
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:58,096
<i>Where is it heading?</i>
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island?</i>

1102
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,474
<i>Where will it take us?</i>

1103
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:11,526
<i>Something special waits for us</i>

1104
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:16,448
<i>Just over the horizon</i>

1105
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:21,786
<i>There'll be hard times</i>
<i>There'll be sad times</i>

1106
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:24,497
<i>But we'll never lose heart</i>

1107
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:26,499
<i>We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead</i>

1108
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:29,961
<i>Let's go!</i>

1109
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:35,341
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1110
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:40,722
<i>Hyokkori Pumpkin Island!</i>

1111
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,528
Poor little Taeko.

1112
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:01,576
I joined the drama group in high school.

1113
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:06,206
I couldn't forget what had happened.

1114
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:07,791
And then?

1115
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,628
It was a lot of fun, acting and all...

1116
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:17,967
but it wasn't for me.
As for becoming a star...

1117
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:19,719
that was a joke.

1118
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,554
But...

1119
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:28,144
I guess dads are the same all over.

1120
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:34,192
When I was in high school,
I so wanted to live in Tokyo.

1121
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,116
I even wrote to my cousin
about universities there.

1122
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:44,953
Did you really?

1123
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:50,041
I gave up. But it annoyed me

1124
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:53,336
to hear other guys
bragging about life in Tokyo.

1125
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,925
Not anymore, though. I respect my dad.

1126
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,510
He's an expert farmer.

1127
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,974
But I know how you felt.

1128
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,560
Mine's just a funny story.

1129
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,728
No, it's the same, I understand.

1130
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:19,779
"But we'll never lose heart,
we hate to cry, so let's laugh instead".

1131
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,490
I also watched Hyokkori Pumpkin Island.

1132
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:23,741
Really?

1133
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,369
Machine Gun Dandy was so cool.

1134
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:28,288
He was my hero!

1135
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:30,582
Of course.

1136
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:34,711
Those songs were full of encouragement.

1137
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:37,422
What was that other one?

1138
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:41,676
<i>If today's no good</i>
<i>You'll have tomorrow</i>

1139
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,637
<i>If tomorrow's no good</i>
<i>You'll have the next day</i>

1140
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,390
<i>If that's no good</i>
<i>There'll be another</i>

1141
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:50,018
<i>There's always a tomorrow</i>

1142
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:55,023
What a weird song!

1143
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,739
<i>That song, about putting things off,</i>

1144
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:06,159
<i>Toshio took in a positive,</i>
<i>affirmative way.</i>

1145
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:10,413
<i>I liked his approach to life.</i>

1146
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:27,639
You're leaving tomorrow?

1147
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:28,681
Yes.

1148
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:34,228
Thank you for having me for so long.

1149
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:36,189
Thank you, my dear.

1150
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:46,282
Do you like it here?

1151
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:50,703
Very much. I feel so at home.

1152
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:54,123
Glad to hear it.

1153
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,835
I've lived here all my life.

1154
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:04,175
Been to Tokyo just once.
For your sister's wedding.

1155
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:07,095
You think it's better here?

1156
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,305
Without a doubt.

1157
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,808
Tokyo's packed with cars, buildings...

1158
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:15,311
People shouldn't live like that.

1159
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:18,815
This is a different world.

1160
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:23,277
You really like it here, then?

1161
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:27,365
Yes. The nice surroundings,
the kind people...

1162
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,495
Taeko.

1163
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:37,125
Why don't you come and live here?
With Toshio?

1164
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:43,589
Since his brother

1165
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:46,134
moved to Tokyo,

1166
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:50,430
why don't you stay here and marry Toshio?

1167
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,056
Granny!

1168
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:55,518
Mother... you've gone too far!

1169
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:58,229
Taeko's shocked.

1170
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:01,524
Please think it over.

1171
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,527
Don't pay any attention. She's joking.

1172
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,155
Joking, right, Granny?

1173
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,866
No. I'm serious.

1174
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:12,827
Don't tell me you wouldn't like it.

1175
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:16,956
It's not a matter of what we'd like...

1176
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,917
Of course we'd love it.

1177
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:25,465
But Taeko's a city person.

1178
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:26,632
Of course.

1179
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:30,762
But she loves it here.

1180
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:35,349
She works so hard on the land,
it's a joy to watch.

1181
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:40,021
There'd be nothing better
than her marrying Toshio.

1182
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,691
You're being rude.
You're embarrassing her.

1183
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:49,614
She's got a decent job in Tokyo.
Besides, she's older than him.

1184
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:53,659
There are jobs in Yamagata too.

1185
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,331
Please don't be angry.

1186
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:03,503
Most of the young wives
work these days, so...

1187
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,589
What are you talking about?

1188
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:11,844
She's only been here twice on vacation.

1189
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,889
Suddenly bringing this up...
You're upsetting her.

1190
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,891
So you're against it?

1191
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:21,604
I didn't say that.
I said let's be realistic.

1192
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:26,067
We don't even know how Toshio feels.

1193
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:29,362
One look at him and it's obvious.

1194
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:35,034
Don't dismiss it before we've asked her.

1195
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,203
Taeko!

1196
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,585
Let her be.

1197
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:51,717
See what you did.
You can't rush these things.

1198
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:55,388
I don't think I was wrong.

1199
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:14,657
<i>I'd never even thought</i>
<i>of being a farmer's wife.</i>

1200
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:19,245
<i>I was strangely moved,</i>

1201
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,372
<i>even imagining it might be possible.</i>

1202
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,711
<i>If only I could've replied:</i>

1203
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:29,422
<i>"I'd love to", like in the movies.</i>

1204
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,216
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

1205
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,847
<i>Suddenly my love of the country,</i>
<i>and my play-farming,</i>

1206
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,266
<i>seemed so phony.</i>

1207
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:45,396
<i>Declaring my love for country life</i>

1208
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:49,442
<i>based on a ten-day vacation</i>
<i>now felt embarrassing.</i>

1209
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,696
<i>Then with no warning...</i>

1210
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,491
<i>everyone seeing right through me.</i>

1211
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,703
<i>It was unbearable.</i>

1212
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,587
<i>I ain't shaking hands with you.</i>

1213
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,509
<i>That shirt he wore today...</i>

1214
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:19,222
<i>-What about it?</i>
<i>-Tanaka's old shirt.</i>

1215
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:20,598
<i>Don't tell anyone.</i>

1216
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:26,479
<i>When it's his turn to feed the ducks,</i>
<i>he takes the bread home.</i>

1217
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:30,107
<i>Did you see his hands?</i>

1218
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:32,568
<i>Glad he's not sitting next to me.</i>

1219
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:34,195
<i>Poor Taeko.</i>

1220
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,614
<i>Have him switch places.</i>

1221
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,867
<i>He should sit with the boys.</i>

1222
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,827
<i>Right, Taeko?</i>

1223
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,790
I don't mind.

1224
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,334
You shouldn't talk like that.

1225
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,086
You don't mind?

1226
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:51,837
Don't be a goody-goody.

1227
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:55,341
Don't you dare tell anyone what we said.

1228
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,597
I'll beat you up!

1229
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:10,189
Don't go!

1230
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,787
What are you doing out here?

1231
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,916
Nothing. Taking a walk.

1232
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,379
You're getting wet. Quick, get in.

1233
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,439
A little souvenir.

1234
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:53,899
Some of Mom's pickles.

1235
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,367
Please don't go back yet.

1236
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:04,827
Why not?

1237
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,913
Just drive... anywhere.

1238
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:09,707
Something wrong?

1239
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:15,254
I knew a boy named Abe.

1240
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:21,093
He came from another school.
He sat next to me.

1241
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,305
He once said,

1242
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,184
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1243
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,377
His family was poor.

1244
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,881
He never had any sports gear.

1245
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:04,470
Always picking his nose
or wiping it on his sleeve...

1246
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:10,351
And if I complained
or even dared frown at him,

1247
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:13,979
he'd threaten to hit me.

1248
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:20,736
I hated it.
I longed for the end of the term,

1249
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:22,947
so we could change seats.

1250
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:28,994
I hated holding hands in dance class,

1251
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:33,749
hated having to lend him my homework.

1252
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:41,757
The girls gossiped and called him names.

1253
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:47,513
But I wouldn't join in.

1254
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:52,810
I thought it was terrible
to talk behind his back.

1255
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,063
But one day...

1256
01:43:57,148 --> 01:44:01,569
he was transferred
in the middle of the term.

1257
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:07,158
The teacher made us all shake hands
and say goodbye.

1258
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:12,079
A feeling of disgust swept the room.

1259
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:18,419
His hands were filthy.

1260
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,926
Walking around, shaking hands with us,

1261
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:28,137
he looked so nervous.

1262
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:35,686
Back at his own desk, only I was left.

1263
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:43,652
When I held out my hand he said,

1264
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,615
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1265
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,786
"I ain't shaking hands with you."

1266
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:04,715
I hated him the most.

1267
01:45:07,176 --> 01:45:10,095
He knew that.

1268
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:13,766
That's why he didn't shake my hand.

1269
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:23,359
Did something happen at the farmhouse?

1270
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:28,697
Ever since I was little...

1271
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,743
I just pretend to be nice.

1272
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,120
Nothing's changed.

1273
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:50,135
You're strange, today. Not the usual you.

1274
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:55,474
I don't know what happened, but...

1275
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:59,228
It's nothing to do with that.

1276
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:04,858
I'm sorry.

1277
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:11,490
I just feel bad about what happened.

1278
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:18,622
I think that boy was stupid.

1279
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:23,586
Maybe he didn't shake your hand
because he liked you.

1280
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:28,507
No, he liked the class president.

1281
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:30,384
He was always acting tough with me.

1282
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:34,471
Hands in pockets, spitting,

1283
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:38,517
swearing, swaggering along,

1284
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,728
showing off.

1285
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:42,146
Exactly.

1286
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:44,732
I know how he feels.

1287
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:49,361
When I was little,
I used to tease the girl I liked.

1288
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:50,863
That's not it.

1289
01:46:51,196 --> 01:46:55,534
He shook hands with everyone but me.

1290
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:58,746
There's the problem.

1291
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,541
Girls never understand how boys feel.

1292
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,169
As if you know...

1293
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:06,795
Let me guess, then...

1294
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:11,884
He wasn't that tough.

1295
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:17,723
He couldn't bully any boys.
He had no friends.

1296
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:25,189
You sat next to him, an easy target.

1297
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,776
He wanted you to think he was tough.

1298
01:47:29,318 --> 01:47:32,780
No way he wanted
to shake hands with everyone.

1299
01:47:33,322 --> 01:47:38,410
He only acted tough around you.

1300
01:47:55,094 --> 01:47:57,429
MARGARET

1301
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:05,062
Don't be filthy!

1302
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:55,112
I felt so guilty and so sorry for him

1303
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:58,073
that I began copying him.

1304
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,077
Too late though, huh?

1305
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:05,706
I couldn't take back

1306
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:08,250
the pain I caused him.

1307
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:20,345
It's stopped raining.

1308
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:22,598
Oh, yes.

1309
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:28,896
The moon's out.

1310
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:43,160
Sometimes at night
you see raccoon dogs here.

1311
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:46,955
Shall we go back?

1312
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:50,876
They must be worried about me.

1313
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:57,883
This'll be the talk of the town.

1314
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:01,637
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

1315
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,766
I wonder what happened
at the house, though?

1316
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:10,062
Please, for my sake, don't ask anyone.

1317
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:16,193
Shall I play that music?

1318
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:58,443
<i>I began to think of my feelings for him,</i>

1319
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:04,116
<i>and of his feelings for me,</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

1320
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:11,665
<i>How was he able to sort out</i>

1321
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:14,459
<i>my mixed-up thoughts ?</i>

1322
01:51:15,377 --> 01:51:19,631
<i>How come I let him get so close?</i>

1323
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:25,178
<i>Somehow he seemed older than me.</i>

1324
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:32,644
<i>He was the one</i>
<i>I wanted to shake hands with.</i>

1325
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:36,899
<i>Just shake hands?</i>

1326
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,350
<i>What was this feeling?</i>

1327
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:17,022
<i>My mind raced as I sat beside him.</i>

1328
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,301
Have you got everything?

1329
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:48,011
Yes, I'm fine.

1330
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:50,639
We'll see you in the winter.

1331
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:54,351
I'll do my farming homework.

1332
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:56,603
What about skiing?

1333
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,523
That just takes practice.

1334
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:03,276
Consider what I said, Taeko.

1335
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,153
What's that?

1336
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:06,238
What?

1337
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:09,741
That's our secret.

1338
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:13,912
Something was strange yesterday.

1339
01:53:14,955 --> 01:53:17,457
Sorry. Next time I'll be fine,

1340
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:20,085
I'll leave the ten-year-old me at home.

1341
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:35,183
Wait for me!

1342
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,186
Take care, Naoko.

1343
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:49,031
Goodbye.
