1
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>Long ago,
our galaxy was ruled</i>

2
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,783
<i>by an alien race
called the Eridians</i>

3
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,611
<i>whose power and technology</i>

4
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,682
<i>were far beyond
human comprehension.</i>

5
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,788
<i>Though they disappeared
ages ago,</i>

6
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,228
<i>they left behind fragments
of their technology,</i>

7
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,932
<i>scraps that became
the foundation</i>

8
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:11,499
<i>for all human advancement.</i>

9
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,739
<i>But the Eridians'
greatest secrets</i>

10
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,874
<i>were hidden in a vault</i>

11
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,178
<i>located on the planet Pandora.</i>

12
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:27,243
<i>The once peaceful world
was overrun by corporations,</i>

13
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:28,747
<i>criminals,</i>

14
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,714
<i>- and treasure seekers...</i>
-<i>Guns, guns, guns!</i>

15
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,647
<i>...fighting
and killing one another</i>

16
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,291
<i>for a chance to find the vault.</i>

17
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,396
<i>But it remained hidden.</i>

18
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,937
<i>Then, amidst
the clouds of chaos,</i>

19
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,964
<i>a glimmer of hope
shone through.</i>

20
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>A prophecy.</i>

21
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,241
<i>That one day,</i>

22
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:55,673
<i>a daughter of Eridia
would open the vault</i>

23
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,777
<i>and restore order
to the broken planet.</i>

24
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,416
<i>Yeah.</i>

25
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,187
<i>That sounds like
some wacko B.S., right?</i>

26
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,159
<i>Well, I thought so too,
until...</i>

27
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:09,887
<i>this mess happened.</i>

28
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,632
There he is!

29
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,729
Stop!

30
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,885
<i>God damn!</i>

31
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,854
There's no air holes in there.

32
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,158
What a stupid helmet.

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,491
Tina.

34
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,590
Hey.

35
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,831
I'm Roland.

36
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,326
Yeah. There's been some, uh...

37
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:49,696
There's been some trouble.

38
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:51,870
And Atlas,

39
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,436
he sent me
to bring you to safety.

40
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,906
- My dad sent you?
- That's right.

41
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,402
His shortest soldier?

42
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:00,010
Yeah, his shortest soldier

43
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,138
to save his least
funny daughter.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,914
<i>Code three security breach.</i>

45
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,709
<i>The station is in lockdown.</i>

46
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,918
<i>All personnel
must shelter in place.</i>

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,220
- Okay, let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,053
- Let's slow down.
-Target in sight!

49
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:20,958
Come on. Come on.

50
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,567
Stop!

51
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,237
Stay down!

52
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,535
- Oh, God.
- No, no!

53
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:32,871
Catch.

54
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,372
Fake stormtrooper-ass bitch.

55
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:38,677
Come here.

56
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,541
<i>Code three security breach.</i>

57
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:40,610
Come on. Come on.

58
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,010
<i>The station is now in lockdown.</i>

59
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:43,754
Wait, I changed my mind.
Take me back to my cell.

60
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,521
- Please.
- Come on.

61
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,061
Holy shit!
One of the Psychos got out.

62
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,895
It's time to go insane!

63
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,694
You're in my spot.

64
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,571
Put him down. Put him down.

65
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,543
Hey, easy.

66
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:09,443
What do you, uh...

67
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,678
What do you say
me and you be friends?

68
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,649
Shit.

69
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,287
Sorry, Knoxx.

70
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,521
My girl.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,927
Krieg,
what's up, man?

72
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:24,758
You want some pancakes?

73
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,898
My girl broken.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,301
It's Krieg, right?

75
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,062
Yeah.

76
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,571
What do you say you help me
get her outta here?

77
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,310
Yeah.

78
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,253
<i>Of course,</i>

79
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,122
<i>we can't all be
the daughter of Eridia,</i>

80
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,983
<i>skipping down
the path of destiny.</i>

81
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,019
<i>Some of us
have to work for a living.</i>

82
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,621
You don't have
to do this, you know.

83
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,992
I mean, I can pay you.

84
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,634
Yeah, whatever's in my wallet
right now, it's yours.

85
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,159
Okay?

86
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,698
Shut up
or I'll break your other arm.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,838
Oh, no,
one arm's good.

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,166
That's fine.

89
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:22,750
-'Sup?
- Sorry.

90
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,159
- Quinn.
- Lilith.

91
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,163
We do have other seats,
you know.

92
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,859
Then he won't have
any trouble finding one.

93
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:34,999
Uh, not tonight.

94
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,733
Top shelf.

95
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,996
Not sure how top
you think the shelves are.

96
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:43,672
Eh, buy your kid
some dance lessons.

97
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,203
Hot date?

98
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,640
You remember that heist down
in Lectra City last month?

99
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,206
Yeah, a couple of guards died.

100
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,349
Yeah, well, this sad sack
was the trigger man.

101
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,511
Listen, I never meant
to shoot anyone.

102
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,715
I was...

103
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,456
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

104
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,655
Bounty hunting? Uh.

105
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:04,055
It's for the young and stupid.
Am I right?

106
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,763
You really want me
to answer that?

107
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,764
I do not.

108
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:08,862
Lilith.

109
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,534
Piss off.

110
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:15,002
I heard you were quite
the crusty old...

111
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,871
Wait. Wait, wait.

112
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:22,909
We, uh, maybe got off
on the wrong foot.

113
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,175
You see, um...

114
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,714
I represent a very wealthy man

115
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,790
who has a contract for you.

116
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,056
I've got a job.

117
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:35,554
Maybe next month.

118
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,192
You collect on that scum

119
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:39,126
dead or alive, right?

120
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,130
Hey.

121
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,093
Not in here, big boy.

122
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,031
We don't want any trouble.

123
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:49,036
It's just, uh, our employer
is, uh, not one for waiting.

124
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,167
Who is?

125
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,161
Are you with these assholes?

126
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,928
Or are you just a fan
of violence?

127
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,591
These gentlemen work

128
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,764
or should I say "worked" for me?

129
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,901
I'll get Kimber
to clean this up.

130
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,573
Thanks, Quinn.

131
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,776
<i>That was impressive.</i>

132
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,677
<i>I warned them
not to underestimate you.</i>

133
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,248
<i>My name is Deukalian Atlas.</i>

134
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,952
<i>And, uh...</i>

135
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:37,989
<i>Hold on.</i>

136
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,815
<i>This is...</i>

137
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,860
<i>This is rather awkward.</i>

138
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,321
<i>Hey, you there.</i>

139
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,653
<i>Fat boy.</i>

140
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,255
<i>Put me on.</i>

141
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:50,601
But she just
killed Frank and Wes.

142
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,296
<i>But she would never
shoot a man of your caliber.</i>

143
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,738
Mm.

144
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,677
<i>As I was saying...</i>

145
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,376
<i>Start walking.</i>

146
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,120
<i>My name is Deukalian Atlas.</i>

147
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,187
<i>President of the...</i>

148
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,953
The Atlas Corporation?

149
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,987
Clue's in the name.

150
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:19,029
Look, uh, this has been
a really long day.

151
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,231
Can we just skip to,

152
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know, whatever this is?

153
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,333
<i>Of course.</i>

154
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,335
<i>My daughter has been kidnapped,</i>

155
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:27,798
<i>and I need her returned to me.</i>

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,135
Bounty hunter, not babysitter.

157
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,803
Haven't you got some
toy soldiers you can send?

158
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,371
<i>Yes, the Crimson Lance.</i>

159
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,841
<i>Unfortunately, the kidnapper
is one of them.</i>

160
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,682
<i>I need an outsider.</i>

161
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,486
<i>Someone who knows
how to handle a planet</i>

162
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,683
<i>full of Psychos, skags,
and vault hunters</i>

163
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,256
<i>like they were born there.</i>

164
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,358
Your daughter's on Pandora?

165
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,426
Thoughts and prayers.

166
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:52,594
But you couldn't pay me enough

167
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,263
to set foot
on that shithole again.

168
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,998
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

169
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,694
Oh.

170
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:00,504
Maybe you could.

171
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,366
Okay, I'll start
when my current contract ends.

172
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,043
<i>Seems like you're free
to start immediately.</i>

173
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,146
<i>Give her the beacon.</i>

174
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:19,390
<i>Activate this device
when you find my daughter</i>

175
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,525
<i>and my people
will retrieve her.</i>

176
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,360
<i>You haven't disappointed
so far, Lilith.</i>

177
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,257
<i>I advise you not to start.</i>

178
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:28,996
Sorry.

179
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,365
Oh, shit.

180
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:57,461
<i>Thank you for
flying Atlas transport pods.</i>

181
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,092
<i>You've arrived
at your destination.</i>

182
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,325
<i>Pandora.</i>

183
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:03,330
<i>Let me tell you
everything you need to know</i>

184
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:04,702
<i>about Pandora.</i>

185
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,835
<i>It's a shithole.</i>

186
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:12,770
<i>I should know. I'm from here.</i>

187
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,569
God, I hate this planet.

188
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,138
<i>It's the kind of place</i>

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,574
<i>you don't ever wanna return to.</i>

190
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,280
<i>So, the sooner I find the girl,</i>

191
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,252
<i>the sooner I can
get the hell outta here.</i>

192
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:32,694
<i>The soldier had hijacked
one of Atlas' shuttles</i>

193
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:35,299
<i>and crash-landed here
months ago.</i>

194
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,158
<i>There wasn't much left of it.</i>

195
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,502
<i>It'd been stripped for parts</i>

196
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,266
<i>and vandalized
by vault hunters.</i>

197
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:45,199
<i>No way to know
if he and Tina even survived.</i>

198
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,269
Wanna know if you've seen her.

199
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,778
<i>But then I spoke
to some locals.</i>

200
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,846
<i>Scavenger kids
barely scraping out a living.</i>

201
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,516
<i>They told me
Tina and the soldier</i>

202
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:55,849
<i>had passed through weeks ago</i>

203
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,621
<i>heading north
towards Fyrestone.</i>

204
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,058
<i>Then I ran
into some other locals.</i>

205
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,526
Run!

206
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,762
<i>Psychos.
Murderous gangs.</i>

207
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:16,538
<i>It was time to catch a ride
and head north.</i>

208
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,211
Hello, vault hunter.

209
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:23,404
Need a ride?

210
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:24,874
Yeah, I'm not
a vault hunter, but...

211
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,548
Then welcome aboard.

212
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,585
People inside, bags up top.

213
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,852
Don't need
any explosives going pop.

214
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:33,356
That is a mess to clean up,
believe me.

215
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,529
<i>Hello, passenger.</i>

216
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:44,131
<i>My name is Marcus.</i>

217
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,029
<i>But of course,</i>

218
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,339
<i>you're not here for small talk.</i>

219
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,176
<i>You are here to find the vault.</i>

220
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,242
Uh, you can stop there.

221
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,342
Not a vault hunter.

222
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,311
Just need a ride.

223
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,413
<i>If you say so.</i>

224
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,421
<i>Well, hello,
brave vault hunter.</i>

225
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,756
<i>So, you've come in search</i>

226
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,920
<i>of the secret lost vault
of the Eridians,</i>

227
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,721
<i>right here on Pandora!</i>

228
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:16,598
<i>Do you want to be rich
beyond your wildest dreams?</i>

229
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,527
<i>First, you must find the keys,</i>

230
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:21,438
<i>then the vault itself,
but it won't be easy.</i>

231
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,372
Could you turn this shit off?

232
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,437
Not a vault hunter.

233
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,040
No can do.

234
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:29,242
This bus is for transporting
vault hunters, so...

235
00:12:29,344 --> 00:12:32,378
<i>Will you be
the one to find the vault?</i>

236
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,244
<i>Ancient alien treasure filled
with high-tech secrets...</i>

237
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,213
<i>Pandora is a dangerous place,</i>

238
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,484
<i>so you need superior firepower.</i>

239
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,624
<i>Prepare yourself
with one of Marcus' munitions.</i>

240
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,253
<i>Next stop, Fyrestone,</i>

241
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,428
<i>where all vault hunters begin.</i>

242
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,496
Uh, no.

243
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,228
Really, I am not...

244
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:54,806
Thanks.

245
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,642
Good luck, vault hunter.

246
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,341
I hope you find
what you're searching for.

247
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:58,868
<i>Two weeks on the trail,</i>

248
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,938
<i>and it was as cold
as Pandora's moons.</i>

249
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:05,239
<i>Tina and the soldier
were long gone.</i>

250
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:09,177
<i>I needed a miracle,
but I got something else.</i>

251
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,330
My eye!

252
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,431
You shot me in my eye!

253
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,730
You blinded me for life!

254
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,697
How will I manage to survive?

255
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,530
I'm just kidding!

256
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:35,564
I was designed to withstand
all kinds of violent acts,

257
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,509
even completely
unjustified ones like yours.

258
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,104
Now, I bet you're wondering,

259
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,070
what's the deal with this thing?

260
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,238
Uh, no, I'm not.

261
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,672
I'm programmed for humor,

262
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:46,513
so I will process that
as "witty banter."

263
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:47,584
Beat it.

264
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,613
I'm a Hyperion brand CL4P-TP,

265
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,248
possibly the last of my kind
still in service.

266
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,387
But you can call me...

267
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,420
Whoopsie! Ha!

268
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,521
You accidentally shot me
in the face again.

269
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:00,362
As I was saying,
you can call me Claptrap.

270
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,432
You know,
I can do this all night,

271
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,735
so piss off.

272
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,802
Believe me,
I wish I could

273
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,131
based on what little
I've experienced

274
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,440
of your horrendous personality.

275
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,232
But I have no choice.

276
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,739
What do you mean?

277
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,245
Did Atlas send you?

278
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,778
Atlas? Yuck!

279
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,244
I don't work
for the competition.

280
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,550
No, I've been lying dormant
under a garbage heap

281
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,719
for... calculating... 36 years!

282
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,783
But the moment
you landed on Pandora,

283
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:25,584
I was reactivated

284
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,251
because I've been programmed
to help you upon your return!

285
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:29,425
No one knew I was coming here.

286
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,219
Not even me.

287
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,395
Who programmed you?

288
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,931
I don't know!

289
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,756
Which is a shame,
because you're an awful person

290
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,792
and I'd love to know
who to blame for this.

291
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,261
Since I don't, I have
no choice but to serve you

292
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,937
until you're dead.

293
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,905
Did that sound like a threat?
Sorry.

294
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,334
Anyway, as long as
you're not dead,

295
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:47,610
- I'm here to help.
- Oh.

296
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,246
And I have many skills.

297
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,140
Balancing.

298
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,516
Turning in circles.

299
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,246
I don't need a partner.

300
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:56,520
Uh, I can also access
the ECHOnet.

301
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,688
Did you say "ECHOnet"?

302
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,251
Can you use it to find someone?

303
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,788
Of course.
Just show me a picture.

304
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,288
I'll hack and search

305
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,159
its slowly dying
visual banks for matches

306
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,363
and find your target's
last known location.

307
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,623
Find her.

308
00:16:08,725 --> 00:16:10,533
She was last seen
outside Fyrestone.

309
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,530
Accessing network.

Your target was last recorded

319
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:31,720
near an abandoned quarry
in the Tundra Express!

320
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,958
It's only 132 days on foot

321
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,856
with a 98% chance of being
eaten by a Craw maggot!

322
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,289
I like those odds!

323
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,625
We're gonna need some wheels.

324
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,229
That's the Crimson Lance,
Atlas' private army.

325
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,670
What are they doing here?

326
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,664
Oh, just a guess here.

327
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,505
Exactly the same thing
you're doing.

328
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,539
And the Lance
teaming up with the Psychos?

329
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,079
It seems like Atlas will hire

330
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,014
just about anyone
to find his daughter.

331
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,448
Concentrating.
Sorry.

332
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,382
Huh. The Lance are leaving.

333
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,857
I guess they didn't find her.

334
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,725
No more Mommy!

335
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,953
Free lunch! Hot delivery!

336
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,166
Huh?

337
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,237
That was so out of character
to save those children.

338
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,677
Well, I needed a ride.

339
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,079
For a second there,

340
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,079
I thought you weren't
a horrible person.

341
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,710
Phew! The world
makes sense again.

342
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,453
Now, there's only room
for one up front,

343
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,753
but worry not.

344
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,651
I can sit on your lap.

345
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,421
Lilith!

346
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:45,723
You accidentally locked me
in the back!

347
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,594
Lilith!

348
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,762
Please drain my battery.

349
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:20,893
Put me back to sleep.

350
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:22,667
I won't tell.

351
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,899
You said you wanted to help.

352
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,628
I said I'm programmed to help.

353
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,737
What I want to do
is wipe my memory,

354
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,765
you horrendous she-devil.

355
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,934
Are you sure these
are the right coordinates?

356
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,611
Yes. This is the last known
location of your quarry.

357
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,344
Get it?

358
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:38,809
But it looks like
she's long gone by now.

359
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,044
Does it?

360
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,748
You know, it's quite
a menagerie you've got here.

361
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:21,951
You could start
your own Pandoran zoo.

362
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,091
You must be Tina.

363
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:34,832
Name's Lilith.

364
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,705
So, that soldier...

365
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,737
who brought you here,

366
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,038
is he playing
hide-and-seek, too?

367
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,508
He left me.

368
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,877
I haven't seen him in days.

369
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,817
Well, I'm here to take you home

370
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,353
to your father.

371
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:55,385
Yeah, he seems like
a real, uh, sweetheart.

372
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,925
What? My daddy?

373
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,858
I get to see my daddy?

374
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,356
Really?

375
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,559
I've been so afraid.

376
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:02,832
- Yeah.
-I've been scared.

377
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,268
Speaking of your daddy...

378
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,665
The noises outside
really freaked me out.

379
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,027
I've just gotta let him know
that I got you safe...

380
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:08,000
I should probably
get my stuff.

381
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:09,071
Shit.

382
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,932
I really love my daddy.

383
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,771
He's such a nurturing
parental figure.

384
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:16,643
Sure, I'll have to take
your word for it.

385
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,743
Miss Lilith,

386
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,849
can you grab my Badonkadonk?

387
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,489
Your what now?

388
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,433
You little...

389
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,744
I love it
when bounty hunters drop by.

390
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,570
Time to make it rain...

391
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:49,746
with your body parts.

392
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,089
Hey.

393
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:02,887
You still alive down there?

394
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,756
She seems deranged.

395
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:10,433
You two have a lot in common.

396
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,767
Only she's smaller,
nicer, cuter.

397
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,805
Hope that wasn't
something important.

398
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,637
Fix this.

399
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,639
Because, whoo, it's toast.

400
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:25,140
Where'd you go?

401
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,142
Tina.

402
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:31,914
Look, I... I'm here to save you.

403
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,823
Do I look like
I need saving?

404
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,686
'Cause I'm up here

405
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,518
and you're all hiding
under a car.

406
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,819
Like a bitch!

407
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,854
You get down here right now.

408
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,768
Oh, Krieg!

409
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:49,436
This fancy-ass woman

410
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:51,639
just pointed a gun
at your best friend.

411
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,846
I will lick
your spine clean.

412
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,981
Holed up with Psychos?

413
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,049
He only used to be a Psycho.

414
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,182
Now he's my big brother!

415
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:04,850
How sweet.

416
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,184
One of you kill the other,
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

417
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,959
Tell her what she's won, Krieg.

418
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,931
You've walked
the wrong dog.

419
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,699
Shoot him in the face.

420
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,705
Shoot him in the face again.

421
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:29,008
It's not working.
Forget it. Abort. Go!

422
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:30,172
Run, run!

423
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,737
Mine's bigger.

424
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:58,409
Listen.

425
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,704
I was sent by your father.

426
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,378
Well, that's strange.

427
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,078
Because I don't
have a father, lady.

428
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,676
I know this planet
can mess with your mind.

429
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:09,886
My mind is awesome.

430
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,784
My mind's so cool.

431
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:15,048
Listen, I don't wanna be here.
Nothing personal.

432
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,257
So, if you could
just come with me,

433
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,258
and you could talk to your dad

434
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,924
and you guys can sort it out,

435
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:19,991
family style. And I can...

436
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,265
Nice work, lady.
You led 'em straight to me.

437
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,071
So, Atlas sent
someone new to find the girl.

438
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:37,072
Never would have thought
it was a scumbag vault hunter.

439
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,615
Actually, I'm not
a scumbag vault hunter.

440
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:42,113
Actually,
she's a scumbag bounty hunter.

441
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:44,252
You know, it's not
my fault you suck at your job,

442
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,080
whoever you are. Who are you?

443
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:48,223
Commander Knoxx
of the Crimson Lance.

444
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:49,924
And I'm taking the girl with me.

445
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,158
Oh, yeah?

446
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,287
You and what army?

447
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:54,729
The one right behind me.

448
00:23:58,664 --> 00:23:59,762
<i>Move, move.</i>

449
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,070
<i>Charlie team, right side.</i>

450
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,737
<i>On your lead, with me!</i>

451
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,667
Stay behind me.

452
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,109
- I'll go.
- Wait.

453
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,839
And if you're both nice,

454
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:11,207
I'll put in a good word
with Daddy.

455
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,143
Sounds good to me.

456
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:15,681
Sergeant Russo,

457
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:17,252
bring me a neurocollar
for the girl.

458
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:18,845
<i>Copy that, Commander.</i>

459
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:20,915
A collar?

460
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:22,290
I love new jewelry.

461
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:24,561
Yeah, I got you a gift, too.

462
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,091
Catch.

463
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:30,099
<i>Will you be my friend?</i>

464
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:30,996
Oh, shit!

465
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,163
Yes!

466
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:41,974
- Come on!
- Hey!

467
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,703
Oh, shit!

468
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:06,867
Tina!

469
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,468
Stop.
She's coming with me.

470
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,016
I leave you alone
for 10 minutes...

471
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,814
Get in the car.

472
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,057
It's okay. He's with me.

473
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,223
I wish I wasn't.

474
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,857
Get in the car!

475
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,195
Go, go!

476
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:42,203
Lilith, wait for me!

477
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:43,171
What did I tell you?

478
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:45,207
Minimal explosions.

479
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,077
No, I said no explosions!

480
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,343
Who the hell are you?

481
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:50,237
This is Lilith. My dad sent her.

482
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,779
Oh. She's a scumbag
bounty hunter.

483
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:55,342
No, I am a high-end
bounty hunter, pal.

484
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:56,881
-No.
- And letting kids get shot at

485
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,252
was not part
of my job description.

486
00:25:58,354 --> 00:25:59,387
Oh, I bet it wasn't.

487
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,349
<i>Lilith. Lilith.</i>

488
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:03,959
<i>You inadvertently left
your best friend behind!</i>

489
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,695
To die!

490
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,028
Lilith!

491
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,575
Move, move, move!

492
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,244
Hey!
No pressure or anything

493
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,040
but I'd love to come inside,

494
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:24,715
<i>- if you get a chance.</i>
- What are you doing?

495
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,448
Just hoping you can
reach out and scoop me up.

496
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,586
You don't have to stop, just...

497
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,254
Hey!

498
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,881
Go easy on the merchandise.

499
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:34,383
Here they come!

500
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:41,129
<i>All units,
you are now weapons free!</i>

501
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:42,523
Take them down!

502
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:51,136
Damn it! You know what?

503
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:53,270
You drive.

504
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:07,948
You programmed to steer?

505
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,791
Who, me?

506
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,491
Who's driving the damn truck?

507
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,369
<i>♪ Driving, driving, driving ♪</i>

508
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,567
<i>♪ I'm so good at driving ♪</i>

509
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,929
<i>♪ I'm a robot driver ♪</i>

510
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,373
<i>Locking on target, ma'am.</i>

511
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,113
We got a problem!

512
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:36,280
Brace for impact!

513
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,454
Holy underwear!

514
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,423
I told you to drive. Damn it.

515
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,709
Bandit one, four,
up on the right. Cut 'em off.

516
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:03,439
They got us pinned.

517
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,682
Not yet they don't. Hold on.

518
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:19,862
- Brace yourselves.
-What are you doing?

519
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,471
That was a terrible idea

520
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,246
but it worked.

521
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,408
Mm, maybe.

522
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,048
Where are we?

523
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,150
Pisswash gully.

524
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,590
What's that smell? Ugh.

525
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:51,227
- Put the window up.
- Why?

526
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,461
Put the window up!

527
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,260
What is that smell?

528
00:28:54,362 --> 00:28:55,798
What is this "smell"
thing everyone talks about?

529
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,525
- Listen to what I just said!
- I don't want to!

530
00:28:57,627 --> 00:28:59,101
- Roll the window up!
- Don't tell me what to...

531
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,935
It's in my mouth!

532
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,573
Sardine showers.

533
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:09,239
It's pee. It's pee.

534
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,780
Now I got pee
all in the middle of my truck.

535
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:13,578
Correction.
It's 67% urine...

536
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,242
14% fecal...

537
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:26,720
- Oh!
-Look out!

538
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:31,461
Oh, God!

539
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,569
Don't nobody move.

540
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:35,401
I'm not about to die in this...

541
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:36,633
Shut up.

542
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,208
Okay.

543
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,778
Is that...

544
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,106
This don't look so good.

545
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:46,949
Yes, it is.

546
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:50,513
That thing looks angry!

547
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:52,119
- Do you wanna press reverse?
-Or hungry.

548
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,589
Oh, my God. It's gonna kill us.
It's gonna kill us.

549
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:56,657
Wait a second.

550
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,255
Do you want me to press reverse?

551
00:29:58,357 --> 00:29:59,328
No, I don't
want you to do nothing!

552
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:04,802
Oh, my God!

553
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:10,071
Your friends are back.

554
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:16,544
<i>Roland, don't be stupid.</i>

555
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,105
<i>Just give us the girl.</i>

556
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:23,348
Everybody, buckle up.
I got a plan.

557
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,615
Somebody hold me!

558
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:29,585
Seriously, I have no seat belt!

559
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:33,160
Roland, what are you doing?

560
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,427
- Go, go, go!
-Hold on!

561
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,367
- Hold it!
-No, no, no!

562
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,653
Shit.

563
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:00,891
Feels like we blew a tire.

564
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:03,657
You call that a plan?

565
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,395
It worked, didn't it?

566
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,457
Feel free to applaud.

567
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,731
Yay for not dying!

568
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,092
Nothing.

569
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,698
- You stay here and keep watch.
-Okay.

570
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,631
But it's you
they don't seem to trust.

571
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,595
And who can blame them?

572
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,070
<i>♪ Scanning, scanning, scanning
Scanning ♪</i>

573
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:58,410
They should be after us by now.

574
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,477
Stingrays won't pursue
without ground support.

575
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,148
Knoxx'll wait on reinforcements.

576
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,419
Let it down, big guy.

577
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:11,420
Before you added kidnapping
to your resume

578
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:13,328
you were an officer
in Crimson Lance.

579
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,764
Right?

580
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,127
Roland didn't kidnap me.
He saved me.

581
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,600
Saved you from what?

582
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,298
A life of ease and plenty?

583
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,439
My daddy thinks
I'm the daughter of Eridia.

584
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,165
I can open the vault.

585
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,267
The vault?

586
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,977
That's what this shit is about?

587
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,308
You stole her for yourself.

588
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,310
Now, do you know
how many people have died

589
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,317
looking for that hole
in the dirt?

590
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,145
Well, I do.

591
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,579
My mother was one of them.

592
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:39,655
We have something they don't,
baby girl.

593
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,153
Oh, let me guess. What? Spirit?

594
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:43,125
Can-do attitude?
The power of friendship?

595
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:45,457
A conscience.

596
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,622
Whatever's in that vault,

597
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:48,832
a man like Atlas
can never get his hands on it.

598
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,297
- All right, Roland, calm down.
-No!

599
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,663
She's a scumbag bounty hunter
who works for Atlas.

600
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:55,195
What, and you think your band
of merry heroes can stop him?

601
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,499
Oh, we can try.

602
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:58,368
We just can't watch our backs
while doing it.

603
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,333
So, do me a favor.
Take your weapon.

604
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:01,776
Toss it over here.

605
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:03,542
Grab some supplies, take a walk.

606
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:07,142
You know, when Atlas finds out
about that party back there,

607
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:08,414
I'm as good as dead.

608
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:10,416
So, like it or not...

609
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:12,847
we're on the same side.

610
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,395
A side without an army,
I might add.

611
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:28,232
So, I hope
you got a better plan than

612
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,271
driving down
a thresher's gullet.

613
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,675
No.

614
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,637
But I know someone who does.

615
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,871
A scientist, a vault expert.

616
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,880
It was her idea to break
Tina out and collect the keys.

617
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:41,649
One key down, two more to go.

618
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,614
And, of course, me.

619
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,720
Load up.

620
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:47,688
Next stop, Sanctuary City.

621
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,588
All right!

622
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:49,821
Road trip!

623
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,329
All right, mask up.

624
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:57,826
We wanna keep a low profile.

625
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,705
<i>Market clear.</i>

626
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:04,907
<i>Copy that.</i>

627
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,508
Oh, this place
sure has changed,

628
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,101
for the worse.

629
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,903
Back off. Back off!
<i>Heading to Gate 23.</i>

630
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,845
Oh, my.

631
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,275
Who's this handsome devil?

632
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:14,315
He's a badass killer.

633
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:18,787
And the reward's
just gone up to 150 grand.

634
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,888
Looks like you're not

635
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,614
the only one
that's special, kid.

636
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:23,751
Cannibal frog convention!

637
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,526
Okay, so we're here.

638
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:26,621
Now what?

639
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:27,763
I need
to locate my contact.

640
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,264
Moxxi will know how to find her.

641
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:30,898
Moxxi?

642
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,228
Yeah. You know her?

643
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,526
Yeah, kind of.

644
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,028
I mean, it's been a while.

645
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,364
Would you be a doll
and hold this? Thank you.

646
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:38,599
Kriegy! Give me a ride.

647
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,140
Hey.

648
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:41,577
We're trying to stay low-key.

649
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,375
Hey. Did you find

650
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:45,946
what you were looking for
in Fyrestone?

651
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:47,475
Never seen you before, stranger.

652
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:50,884
Nice try, Miss Vladof Infinity.

653
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:52,879
I never forget a gun.

654
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:56,418
What are you up to now,
Not-A-Vault-Hunter?

655
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,591
She's vault hunting.

656
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:00,564
I knew it.

657
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,395
I told you, I knew it.

658
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:13,842
Well, well, well.

659
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,945
Look what the skag dragged in.

660
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,543
-Hey, Mox.
- Get on in there.

661
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,151
Oh, you are most welcome.

662
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,825
Milkshake for
my little sugarplum,

663
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,927
and drinks for my friends.

664
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:35,522
I got something to show you.

665
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,633
Everyone, come over here.

666
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,832
Step into my office.

667
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:40,962
Roland?

668
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,735
- Roland.
-I got it.

669
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,369
Excuse me.

670
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:49,472
I knew it was you.

671
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:51,640
- Oh, my God.
-Hey, Larry.

672
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,682
You probably
don't remember me, but

673
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,845
I sure remember you.

674
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,886
Your mama was a good woman.

675
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:02,016
Yeah, well, wouldn't know.

676
00:36:03,624 --> 00:36:06,163
All right. So,
where is this, uh, scientist?

677
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,525
So, this is where you're headed.

678
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:11,724
You go all the way
up those stairs

679
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:14,002
and right there is the elevator.

680
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,704
-Mm-hm.
- Push the button.

681
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,998
Passcode's "ECHO."

682
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:18,802
- ECHO?
- ECHO.

683
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,476
You sure it's safe
to stay there?

684
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:25,542
Yeah, as long as this one here
don't blow up the joint.

685
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,641
How's that milkshake there,
sugar pie?

686
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,380
Listen.

687
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:32,618
For whatever it's worth...

688
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:37,150
I'm real happy
that you came back home.

689
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:40,096
And I hope that you know
how much your mama loved you.

690
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,557
She always told me
how special you were.

691
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,992
You know, I appreciate the help.

692
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:46,060
Let's just leave it at that.

693
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:50,337
Right.

694
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,569
When they were chasing you,
I was like,

695
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,602
"Hey, don't shoot that guy.
He's my roomie."

696
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,605
- You... You said that?
- Yeah, man.

697
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:56,807
Hey, you see
your bounty went up?

698
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:58,680
- My?
- Your bounty.

699
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:00,113
Get outta here.

700
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:01,674
Knoxx is on the warpath, stud.

701
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:03,351
What'd you do to her, man?

702
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:05,617
Man, I kind of... kind of
ghosted her, you know?

703
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,051
Yeah, you did, man.
You ghosted all of us, man.

704
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,393
Yeah.

705
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:14,930
Anyway, man,
it was really good to see you.

706
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,298
And, you know, you can trust me.

707
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,398
We're friends, man.
I'm not gonna tell a soul.

708
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,735
Oh, Larry,
I'm not worried about you.

709
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,069
You're my guy.

710
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,735
You're my main man.

711
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,771
I got a feeling you're not
going to tell anybody.

712
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:33,610
Is he going to be okay?

713
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,647
Well, he'll have
a hell of a hangover.

714
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:38,649
Ooh, who knew electricity
provoked defecation?

715
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,213
Hey.

716
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,955
Y'all better
hustle out the back.

717
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,058
Go out this way.

718
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,920
I got these guys. Go on. Go on.

719
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:48,760
- Claptrap, let's go.
- Go on. Go on. Go on.

720
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:52,596
Your buddy boy here just drank
about 10 shots too many

721
00:37:52,698 --> 00:37:55,003
then he dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

722
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,337
I think you forgot me.

723
00:37:57,439 --> 00:38:01,443
Mm. And a tip
is always appreciated.

724
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,081
All right.

725
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,617
This looks like it.

726
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:13,290
ECHO.

727
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,890
ECHO?

728
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,030
Sure that's the password?

729
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,400
Maybe you gotta echo the "ECHO."

730
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,868
ECHO. ECHO.

731
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,063
All right.

732
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:33,142
You fools would literally
be dead without me.

733
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,876
- You need me.
-Here we go.

734
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,707
Come on, Claptrap.

735
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,177
Where are we going?
Up.

736
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:48,652
So, you trust
this woman?

737
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,991
She's a xeno-archaeologist,
all right?

738
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:52,821
She's a little odd.

739
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,689
But she knows everything
about the vault.

740
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,131
So, if she says something weird,

741
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,629
don't let it get to you, okay?

742
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:00,969
I am 10
to the 100th power

743
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:02,702
impressed with this place.

744
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:05,865
Cool.

745
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:07,842
Oh! I see you have the girl.

746
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:09,244
That's right.

747
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:10,809
Did you find
a vault key, too?

748
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,914
Hi, I'm Tina.

749
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,308
The special one.

750
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,947
Huh.

751
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,852
Tannis.

752
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:32,567
Oh.

753
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,295
Hello, Lilith.

754
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,969
Okay, good.
So you guys know each other.

755
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,905
Unfortunately.

756
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,644
I'm not staying here.

757
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,747
What?

758
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,513
Okay.

759
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:49,342
But you all smell
like thresher urine.

760
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:51,849
And your wanted poster
just went up all over town.

761
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,785
So, I suggest that you all
settle in and clean up.

762
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:57,124
Now, the electroshower
is right over there.

763
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:58,460
Ooh, shower.

764
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,428
Hey, kids,
we're out of here. Let's go.

765
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,088
Lilith? Hey, I get it.
There's history here.

766
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,692
I don't even need
to know what it is.

767
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,227
The point is that she's right.

768
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:06,761
If there's a poster of me,
that means there's one of you.

769
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,062
They're looking for all of us.

770
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:08,937
I hate to say it,
but we don't have a choice.

771
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,066
We gotta sit tight.

772
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,701
Lilith, we don't have a choice.

773
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:15,210
What is happening, Tannis?

774
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,936
-Electroshower.
- Wait.

775
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:18,781
Wait, guys.

776
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,344
-Time to shower.
- Claptrap.

777
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:23,886
<i>♪ It's time for showering
Showering, time for some... ♪</i>

778
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,220
That's not... No.

779
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,347
Claptrap.

780
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,491
Rebooting.

781
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:32,726
Everybody,
just settle down, please.

782
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,761
Settle down.

783
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:36,991
Hey, hey! Settle down.

784
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:38,224
Square root of 929,000...

785
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:40,068
I am basing my assumption
that you're upset

786
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,303
on your body language.

787
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,540
Perceptive as ever, I see.

788
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:49,710
Because of your mother?

789
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,779
Uh, no, because of you.

790
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,485
She trusted you...

791
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,950
to take care of me.

792
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,458
But you ran back here

793
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,957
to chase after that mystical
Eridian vault bullshit.

794
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,927
I left you with tradespeople.

795
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:11,862
Oh.

796
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:14,035
Yes. You mean
the murderers and thieves

797
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,428
on the mining ship.

798
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,804
It's what your mother wanted.

799
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,009
She wanted me
to learn how to kill

800
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,339
by the age of 10?

801
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,270
How to survive.

802
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:26,346
I had to come back here
to finish her work.

803
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,210
She believed the Eridian vault

804
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:30,551
had the power to change things
for the better and...

805
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:33,314
She traded her daughter
for a waste of time.

806
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,135
Go back inside.

807
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:54,203
It's not safe.

808
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:56,546
I can look after myself.

809
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,043
Told you I'm special.

810
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,210
Aren't we all?

811
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,349
Yeah.

812
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:04,820
They made me that way.

813
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,050
Made you?

814
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:08,481
What do you mean?

815
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,894
Your father is Deukalian Atlas,

816
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,227
isn't he?

817
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:16,264
Yes and no.

818
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:19,098
Not a "yes or no" question.

819
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,570
He's...

820
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:22,902
my...

821
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,708
creator.

822
00:42:28,272 --> 00:42:32,613
Atlas is bananapants obsessed
with the vault.

823
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,549
He says only a daughter
of Eridia can open it.

824
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:38,082
He found a piece
of the vault key,

825
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:41,782
and on that piece

826
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:43,989
was a tiny bit...

827
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:45,928
of blood.

828
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,696
Eridian blood.

829
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,430
He cloned an Eridian.

830
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:52,932
And guess who that Eridian is?

831
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,067
Hmm. Is her name Tina?

832
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,772
Boom.

833
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,133
But it's all good.

834
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:04,446
I don't care I grew up in a lab.

835
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,941
I never wanted
a mother or a father.

836
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,416
He created you to open a vault.

837
00:43:10,518 --> 00:43:12,750
God, what an asshole.

838
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,690
That's an understatement.

839
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,787
He'll use whatever
technology's inside

840
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,388
and make superweapons.

841
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,732
The dude's got major issues.

842
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:27,934
I'm just a product to Atlas.

843
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:30,163
If he gets me,

844
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:32,037
he's gonna make me
open the vault.

845
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,975
Then he's just gonna lock me up
into another secret lab

846
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:37,911
and do more experiments.

847
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,084
And if you saw
the things they did

848
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,184
to the other clones...

849
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,785
He's not gonna find you.

850
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,097
Yo! Whassup?

851
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,335
Yeah!

852
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:03,272
Hey, there, sugar chips.

853
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,801
You need a firmware update?

854
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:06,365
Piss off, short stuff.

855
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:08,073
Someone needs
an oil change.

856
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:13,846
My daddy always had a saying.

857
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:17,043
Never trust a man
who can't hold his liquor.

858
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:18,515
She tased me, all right?

859
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:19,846
I love alcohol.

860
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,949
I can be wild.

861
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,315
As for that little girl,

862
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,559
you don't think
the second I saw her,

863
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,052
I wouldn't hand her
right over to you

864
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:27,196
just to get rid of you?

865
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:28,521
I admire the fight,

866
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,523
but let me take you through
what happens next.

867
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,129
Spare parts!
We seal the city...

868
00:44:32,231 --> 00:44:34,068
Anyone got
spare parts that I can use?

869
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:34,935
Uh-oh.

870
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,370
Hey, hey, that's his robot.

871
00:44:37,472 --> 00:44:38,672
It's an old CL4P...

872
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:39,872
Excuse me.
Coming through.

873
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:41,711
Got a computer virus.
Highly contagious.

874
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:44,172
Clear the street!

875
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:45,479
<i>You,
down on the ground.</i>

876
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:46,639
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

877
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,352
Now that we have
Tina and the first key,

878
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:52,788
I wanna show you this.

879
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,885
This is a mining journal
left behind

880
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,253
by a corporate bureaucrat.

881
00:44:58,356 --> 00:45:00,228
He cataloged everything
the miners brought in,

882
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,427
most of it useless.

883
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,964
But on this page...

884
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,234
Another key.

885
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:13,235
He thought it was a useless
piece of Eridian pottery.

886
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:15,871
He had no clue
they'd found a vault key.

887
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:17,403
That makes two of three.

888
00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:19,172
So,
if this is the second key,

889
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:21,176
why don't you already have it?

890
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:23,511
Because the mine
is in Caustic Caverns.

891
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,014
Oh, shit.

892
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:27,955
Danger! Red alert!

893
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,250
People, we need to move!
The soldiers, they're coming!

894
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,384
They have guns!
They're shooting!

895
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:32,458
- They're firing!
- Clappy, slow your roll.

896
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,860
What is the dealio?

897
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:36,456
The soldier woman
who really hates Roland,

898
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:39,031
which suggests
the two of them had some...

899
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:41,131
- Come on, get to the point.
- She was at the bar

900
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,205
interrogating Moxxi
and your friend Larry...

901
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,263
Was that his name?

902
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:45,967
Seemed like a decent roommate.

903
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:47,269
Did they see you?

904
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,579
Do you promise
not to be angry if I say yes?

905
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,082
<i>Lance units,
block all exits.</i>

906
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,318
No one leaves.

907
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,085
Get this thing out of here.

908
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,618
Masks off.

909
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,122
Of course, Commander.

910
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,221
Of course. Hey!

911
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:05,486
Double-perched custom Blaster
with ionized projectiles.

912
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:08,097
That'll outpace any
bone shredder on Pandora.

913
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,158
You wanna trade?

914
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,929
I'll give you
special price, huh?

915
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:14,561
Sanctuary
is now on lockdown.

916
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:17,236
No one goes anywhere
until we find that robot.

917
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:20,601
Is there any way out of here
that doesn't involve garbage?

918
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:22,977
Um...

919
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,138
No.

920
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:47,501
What?

921
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:48,629
Did you guys wanna use it?

922
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:56,137
The entrance is underneath
all of that debris.

923
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,143
Under there.

924
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:03,111
Whoo! Look what I got!

925
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:04,614
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

926
00:47:04,716 --> 00:47:05,679
Open it.

927
00:47:10,722 --> 00:47:12,519
Hello.

928
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,323
Would you
look at that? A ladder.

929
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:16,564
Unfortunately,
my design doesn't facilitate

930
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,232
this type of vertical travel.

931
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,325
Drats.

932
00:47:19,427 --> 00:47:20,870
Guess I'll just...

933
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,673
Well...

934
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,304
- Destiny awaits.
-I'm fine!

935
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,405
Mm! Meat soup.

936
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:33,146
Chemical waste
from the mining equipment.

937
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:35,476
It's corrosive enough
to dissolve almost anything

938
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:37,018
except the natural crystals
in this cavern.

939
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:40,853
How are we gonna
get through this?

940
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:43,220
Well, it's not gonna
be that way.

941
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,226
Looks like we gotta
take the high road.

942
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:47,025
Krieg.

943
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:48,555
Let's see if we can
grab this here.

944
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,598
Luckily,
my wheel's too large,

945
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,360
so I'll just watch you all melt

946
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:53,793
from a safe
and reasonable distance.

947
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:58,033
You are small enough
to get in there.

948
00:47:58,135 --> 00:47:59,502
Head through the tunnel,

949
00:47:59,604 --> 00:48:01,909
locate the main access control
panel and then unlock

950
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,579
- the door at the end.
-Can do!

951
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,344
- Quietly.
-No problem.

952
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:07,573
I wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to each one of you

953
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:09,517
in the most
horrifying way possible.

954
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:12,048
All right, I'll go first.

955
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,281
- I got this.
- No, I got it.

956
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:15,615
- I got it.
-Tina!

957
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,392
Coming through!
Hey, hey.

958
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,525
Relax.

959
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:19,559
I'm the lightest.

960
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:21,161
- Tina!
- Hey!

961
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,664
Ladies first.

962
00:48:30,738 --> 00:48:32,040
Don't mind if I do.

963
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:43,612
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

964
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:47,256
Be careful.

965
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:58,233
Guys.

966
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,067
Look.

967
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:10,238
Hope blooms
in the strangest places.

968
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,305
It's kind of pretty.

969
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,481
Mission accomplished!

970
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,344
The door is unlocked.

971
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:15,884
<i>♪ Who's the best?
I'm the best ♪</i>

972
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,619
<i>♪ Give me a job
I pass the test ♪</i>

973
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,518
Can't take him anywhere.

974
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,618
Well?

975
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,715
You're welcome.

976
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:24,119
Impossible to please.

977
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,438
Scream showers.

978
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,005
It's Bloodshots.

979
00:49:39,107 --> 00:49:40,604
Yeah, their symbols
are everywhere.

980
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:44,679
These are the Psychos
other psychos are afraid of.

981
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,541
They're probably still here.

982
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,307
- Let's go find out.
-  No bombs.

983
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:49,818
I'll be surgical.

984
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,812
There's only one of you
in the world...

985
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:54,683
and you're special.

986
00:49:57,589 --> 00:49:59,460
You guys sit tight.
Wait for us to come back.

987
00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:00,656
Come on, Lil.

988
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,642
Dealt with Bloodshots before?

989
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,474
Once.

990
00:50:21,576 --> 00:50:22,715
How'd you make it out?

991
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:24,920
Kind words and hugs?

992
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:25,884
I don't know what it is
that happens to 'em

993
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,584
when they're down here

994
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:29,289
but it's like they get hit
with an extra dose of crazy.

995
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:36,956
Strip the flesh,
salt the wound!

996
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,330
- There's too many to shoot.
- Or blow up?

997
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:44,037
Well, we can't really blend in.

998
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,541
We don't look
anything like them.

999
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:46,904
Except you, handsome.

1000
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:48,944
Thank you!

1001
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,407
Well,
according to my calculations,

1002
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:51,745
the odds of a successful
stealth operation

1003
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,148
in this scenario is...

1004
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:55,748
0%? Wow!

1005
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,450
You never see that!

1006
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:59,886
Well, I guess that's it then.
Back to the truck, right?

1007
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:01,455
Did you factor in a distraction?

1008
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,922
Of course.

1009
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:04,288
I analyzed 16 million versions

1010
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,724
where one of you
creates a distraction.

1011
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:07,353
Total failure.

1012
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,862
No, not one of us.

1013
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:11,300
Wait, who else is...?

1014
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,902
Oh, no.

1015
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,368
Coming through.

1016
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:24,212
Hi, there.

1017
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,280
How you doing?

1018
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:31,747
Just a little nervous laughter
to crack the ice.

1019
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:34,582
Shiny!

1020
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:36,284
Just rolling through town

1021
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:37,753
looking for a good time.

1022
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:42,730
Ladies and gentlemen!

1023
00:51:42,832 --> 00:51:44,562
Your attention, please.

1024
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,102
I am here because I want to be

1025
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:50,629
and not for a more
justifiable reason

1026
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:52,301
like trying to be a distraction.

1027
00:51:52,403 --> 00:51:54,239
Even though it makes no sense

1028
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:55,777
for me to say
what I'm about to say,

1029
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,475
and even though anyone rational

1030
00:51:57,577 --> 00:51:59,679
would suspect it was just
part of a crude plan,

1031
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:00,950
I have decided

1032
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:04,316
entirely on my own
to say the following.

1033
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,946
Y'all bitches
need to eat your own butts

1034
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:09,289
with your poopy-mouth...

1035
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:11,620
...ass-faces until you die
from loser poisoning

1036
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:15,423
like the stupid
pus-crotches that you is.

1037
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,869
Was that too much?
It was too much, wasn't it?

1038
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:23,366
What took it over the edge?

1039
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,734
Was it the
"poopy-mouth ass-faces"?

1040
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,737
Stairs. Come on!

1041
00:52:33,545 --> 00:52:35,107
Not in the undercarriage!

1042
00:52:37,116 --> 00:52:38,154
My programming...

1043
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:41,789
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

1044
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,453
Son of a... You got me!

1045
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:46,793
Okay, I'm dead. How about that?

1046
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,125
Is he going to be all right?

1047
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,868
Excellent plan.

1048
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,279
Who would have guessed
they'd shoot me, right?

1049
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:07,007
Well, we survived.

1050
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,516
So much for your 0%.

1051
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,717
You're not out yet.

1052
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,116
I think
the key's in here.

1053
00:53:20,027 --> 00:53:21,326
Sweet.

1054
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:23,826
So, the key
is in one of these crates.

1055
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:25,828
One of these

1056
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,004
kabillion crates.

1057
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:31,536
Yeah, this is gonna
take a minute.

1058
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:32,772
Four days
if you work around the clock

1059
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:34,374
which you can't,

1060
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,577
because your bodies
require rest every 16 hours.

1061
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:37,871
Lazy!

1062
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:40,012
Not if those psycho Raiders
find us first.

1063
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:42,182
Those are Bloodshots.

1064
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:43,742
Raiders live above.
Not down here.

1065
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:45,251
There are no Raiders down here.

1066
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:46,682
Tannis, nobody's talking
about Raiders.

1067
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:48,123
What's the big deal
about Raiders?

1068
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,354
I know,
but you brought up Raiders.

1069
00:53:49,456 --> 00:53:51,059
How about
we forget about it?

1070
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,025
Am I missing
something here?

1071
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:53,390
But I don't understand.

1072
00:53:53,492 --> 00:53:54,455
Forget about
the Raiders!

1073
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:55,693
Just forget about it.

1074
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,728
I'm sorry.

1075
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,228
I understand...

1076
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,239
- Bloodshots are down here.
- You keep bringing up Raiders.

1077
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:38,907
- Tannis, I swear to God...
-I found it.

1078
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,974
- What?
-The second key.

1079
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:42,902
How... How did...?

1080
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:45,413
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

1081
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:48,675
Yeah, we'll see
how lucky you are.

1082
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:49,984
We still gotta get out of here.

1083
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,685
There's an exit portal this way.

1084
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:52,618
Come on.

1085
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:57,920
Shh!

1086
00:54:59,688 --> 00:55:00,593
What's that?

1087
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,062
What? I'm expelling
the excess lead.

1088
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,006
Big bullet. Big bullet coming.
There we go.

1089
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,171
Can't you do this another time?

1090
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:14,775
This has to happen now.

1091
00:55:14,877 --> 00:55:17,144
Don't judge me.

1092
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,145
What?
How is this funny?

1093
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:22,547
You keep it down.

1094
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:23,978
Do I judge you
when you blast out a loaf?

1095
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,321
- We don't wanna attract...
-Look out!

1096
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,456
A little help?

1097
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:33,788
Incoming!

1098
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,864
Go, go!
Okay, going now!

1099
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,852
Tannis!

1100
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:04,459
Thank you.

1101
00:56:05,325 --> 00:56:06,560
On your left!

1102
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:08,023
Wow!

1103
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:18,671
Come here, girlie!

1104
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,751
What are you doing?

1105
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:30,942
I needed a gun.

1106
00:56:31,044 --> 00:56:33,116
So you ask for it, Tannis. Ask!

1107
00:56:33,218 --> 00:56:34,581
Move!

1108
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:44,323
That way!

1109
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:48,927
We've got this, guys!

1110
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,639
There's nothing we can't do!

1111
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,731
Stairs!

1112
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,873
Krieg, help me! I'm not...

1113
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:53,772
Go, go!

1114
00:57:08,684 --> 00:57:09,723
Lilith, I got you!

1115
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:10,855
Go!

1116
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,256
Roland!

1117
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:19,798
Watch out!

1118
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,470
Go, go!

1119
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,548
Time to go.

1120
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,188
I'm sure
we're past the hard part.

1121
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,382
Okay.

1122
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,732
Go, go, go!
We gotta move!

1123
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:00,671
Let go of me!
Tina!

1124
00:58:00,773 --> 00:58:02,701
Lilith!
Hello!

1125
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:10,451
Follow me this way.

1126
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,951
I have a tremendous
sense of direction.

1127
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:13,021
Oh, God!

1128
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:27,866
Help me!

1129
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:34,301
Krieg, spin me!

1130
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:36,736
I found it! I found it!

1131
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:37,838
There's an elevator!

1132
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,713
Follow me. This way. Come on.

1133
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:44,079
- Roland!
-Clappy, go! Go! Go!

1134
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:45,785
Lilith!
Don't leave me behind again!

1135
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:51,791
There's a service elevator
this way!

1136
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,761
It's up here.

1137
00:58:56,863 --> 00:58:59,725
- This way. Oh, no.
-Go! Go, go, go!

1138
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,930
Shit!

1139
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:02,727
This is gonna take some time.
Hold this.

1140
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,839
Claptrap!

1141
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,263
I need help!

1142
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:07,198
Uh,
in front of everyone?

1143
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,406
Yes!
Look away!

1144
00:59:08,508 --> 00:59:10,771
Look away! I command you!

1145
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:12,036
Krieg, we got company.

1146
00:59:12,138 --> 00:59:14,776
It's time to bleed!

1147
00:59:14,878 --> 00:59:16,046
- Come on!
- I am trying!

1148
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,086
Krieg, wait!

1149
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:22,382
Krieg!

1150
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:35,393
It's not working.

1151
00:59:35,495 --> 00:59:36,935
Aren't you supposed
to be smart?

1152
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:43,277
I'll turn you
into a meat bicycle!

1153
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,503
Another victim!

1154
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,449
Thanks, kid.

1155
01:00:04,925 --> 01:00:06,600
Tannis!

1156
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:08,131
- How we doing?
-I don't have it!

1157
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,401
Come here,
give me a kiss!

1158
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,812
Krieg! Pull back!

1159
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:32,250
Go! Go!

1160
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:34,223
I regret everything!

1161
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:43,296
Come on!

1162
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:45,171
-We gotta go.
- It's not working.

1163
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:46,004
Go, Tannis.

1164
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,337
We have another wiring problem.

1165
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:51,474
Baby!

1166
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:54,683
Shit.

1167
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,517
- Roland, what are you doing?
-Fixing it.

1168
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,013
- Get back here!
-Hey.

1169
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,756
No. Please don't.

1170
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,451
- Roland!
- Hey, Tina.

1171
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,586
I'll meet you at the vault.

1172
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,192
I promise.

1173
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,294
Tannis.

1174
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:14,934
- Hit it!
- Okay, hitting!

1175
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:20,170
Roland!

1176
01:01:26,479 --> 01:01:28,206
All right, Bob.

1177
01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:30,318
You ready to kick some ass?

1178
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,351
I knew you'd say that.

1179
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:14,389
The brakes are out!
We are not slowing down!

1180
01:02:15,629 --> 01:02:16,655
We are not gonna make it!

1181
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:29,643
Teleportation.

1182
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:31,543
I can move stuff
with my mind, y'all.

1183
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:32,610
We're not dead?

1184
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:34,412
I'm still enslaved? Drats.

1185
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,379
Chutney vomit queen.
Ew! Yuck!

1186
01:02:38,481 --> 01:02:40,947
I think the teleportation
has made her quite ill.

1187
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,288
How did you do that?

1188
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,951
I don't know.

1189
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:45,923
Just kind of happened.

1190
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:47,988
Hey, Roland's
gonna be okay, right?

1191
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,422
He's an elite soldier.

1192
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:51,800
If anyone can get out of that,
it's him.

1193
01:02:54,264 --> 01:02:55,502
Where are we?

1194
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,837
I can't get a read on ECHOnet.

1195
01:02:57,939 --> 01:03:00,136
But it looks like
we're in an old mine.

1196
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:02,635
Maybe we find
some shelter inside.

1197
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:28,300
I've combined the keys.

1198
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:29,398
Look.

1199
01:03:33,403 --> 01:03:35,168
What's that?
Some kind of a map?

1200
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,669
Incredible, isn't it?

1201
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,111
It isn't just a key.

1202
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,644
And right there...

1203
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:43,951
The vault?

1204
01:03:45,312 --> 01:03:46,346
It is a shame

1205
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,120
your mother is not here
to see this.

1206
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,489
It was there the whole time.

1207
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:52,892
Apparently.

1208
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:54,460
I've seen that
before somewhere.

1209
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:55,828
Firehawk.

1210
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,691
Eridian goddess,
protector of the planet.

1211
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:06,138
Well, it's all a bit pointless
without the third piece.

1212
01:04:07,268 --> 01:04:08,437
Oh, well, we have it.

1213
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,239
She's the key.

1214
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:16,076
The elevator confirmed it.

1215
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:17,584
That was a phasewalk.

1216
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:19,220
Only an Eridian could do that.

1217
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,378
Wait a minute.

1218
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,588
If she's a piece of the key,

1219
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,049
what happens when she opens it?

1220
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,354
I assumed you knew.

1221
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,025
Did your mother never tell you?

1222
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,588
I was eight. I can barely
remember her face.

1223
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:32,591
When the daughter of Eridia
places the key,

1224
01:04:32,693 --> 01:04:34,826
the pieces are consumed
and the vault opens.

1225
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:41,104
Now, I don't necessarily
believe that means kill her.

1226
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:42,674
But you're prepared
to take that risk.

1227
01:04:42,776 --> 01:04:44,341
Well, we have no choice.

1228
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:46,742
Either we take her

1229
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:48,213
or Atlas does.

1230
01:04:50,348 --> 01:04:52,250
There is no salvation
without sacrifice.

1231
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,858
Worst orgy ever.

1232
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:20,740
Rest in peace, Bob.

1233
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:33,892
Oh, shit.

1234
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,767
Whoa. Sorry.

1235
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:49,643
I thought for a moment there
you had rigor mortis.

1236
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,171
It was a really nice moment.

1237
01:05:51,273 --> 01:05:52,946
I'll treasure it always.

1238
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:55,142
Also, I scavenged
the final parts I needed

1239
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,676
from a dead transformer,

1240
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:59,713
and fixed the thing
you so recklessly destroyed.

1241
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,431
You didn't press this, did you?

1242
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:14,263
I did not.

1243
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:15,927
I can crush it again
if you'd like.

1244
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:20,138
Oh, "Thank you, Claptrap.
You're indispensable."

1245
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:23,143
Thank you, Lilith.
Your praise warms my soul.

1246
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:47,662
<i>Lilith.</i>

1247
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:51,006
<i>Have you broken the beacon
I gave you?</i>

1248
01:06:54,405 --> 01:06:57,837
Ah, this thing was junk
the whole time.

1249
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,014
<i>Not at all.</i>

1250
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:03,818
<i>It was a highly accurate
tracking device</i>

1251
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,511
<i>that has led me
right to you and Tina.</i>

1252
01:07:06,614 --> 01:07:07,679
<i>Now, I was beginning to think</i>

1253
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,357
<i>that she would
elude me forever.</i>

1254
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:10,589
She's smart.

1255
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:12,654
<i>She is mine.</i>

1256
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:17,690
<i>And the Crimson Lance</i>

1257
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:18,933
<i>are on their way
to collect her now.</i>

1258
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,698
If you come after her,
I'll destroy the key.

1259
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,767
<i>No, you won't.</i>

1260
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:23,500
<i>Because if you did,</i>

1261
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:26,832
<i>then I would have to kill</i>

1262
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:29,668
<i>the rest of that heroic band
of vault hunters</i>

1263
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,745
<i>she's been
slumming around with.</i>

1264
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,879
<i>And I promise you, Lilith,</i>

1265
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:35,413
<i>they won't be quick deaths.</i>

1266
01:07:37,816 --> 01:07:39,153
<i>Good.</i>

1267
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:41,218
<i>Glad to see you making</i>

1268
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,520
<i>the smart choice for once.</i>

1269
01:07:44,892 --> 01:07:46,553
<i>And when this is over,</i>

1270
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:48,228
<i>you'll be paid
what we agreed on.</i>

1271
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:51,693
<i>Thank you, Lilith.</i>

1272
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,604
Oh.

1273
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:06,474
Tina, look, I know
how this must look, but...

1274
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:09,183
I'm the only one
who can open the vault.

1275
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,881
And I'm gonna use whatever
is inside to kill him.

1276
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,388
Too bad you won't
be around to see it.

1277
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,095
- Wait.
- Enjoy your freedom.

1278
01:08:23,197 --> 01:08:24,462
Tina. Tina, no!

1279
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:07,505
I'm dancing because...

1280
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,142
you're alive.

1281
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:11,644
Not because
I thought you were dead.

1282
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:13,010
Heartwarming.

1283
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:14,444
Where are the others?

1284
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:15,879
They found a truck
in the village and left.

1285
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:16,976
Without me.

1286
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:19,253
What village?

1287
01:09:22,654 --> 01:09:23,955
This must have
been one of the original

1288
01:09:24,057 --> 01:09:25,325
Pandoran settlements.

1289
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,195
How quaint.

1290
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:31,023
I know this place.

1291
01:09:48,449 --> 01:09:49,980
<i>Come on.
Come on. Leave it.</i>

1292
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:51,351
<i>Come on, sweetie.</i>

1293
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,754
Hurry, give me Lilith!

1294
01:09:54,856 --> 01:09:56,114
Come on! Come on!

1295
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,352
Remember I will always love you!

1296
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:00,195
Mama!

1297
01:10:00,925 --> 01:10:02,527
No!

1298
01:10:10,865 --> 01:10:11,833
Hey,
where are you going?

1299
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:13,901
Lilith.

1300
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:15,474
Lilith!

1301
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:34,088
Is this your home?

1302
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,186
Yeah.

1303
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:38,266
I used to live here once.

1304
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:55,514
This place is...

1305
01:10:57,011 --> 01:10:59,848
reminiscent of something
deep in my files.

1306
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,688
That drawing...

1307
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:08,263
I feel strange.

1308
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:15,765
<i>Lilith.</i>

1309
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:17,470
Mom?

1310
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,132
<i>If you're seeing this...</i>

1311
01:11:22,671 --> 01:11:23,905
<i>I'm afraid I didn't make it.</i>

1312
01:11:26,006 --> 01:11:28,848
<i>I'm so sorry
that I sent you away.</i>

1313
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,417
<i>I didn't want to.</i>

1314
01:11:31,878 --> 01:11:33,853
<i>But as soon as I realized</i>

1315
01:11:33,955 --> 01:11:35,614
<i>what you are,</i>

1316
01:11:35,716 --> 01:11:36,984
<i>what you might become...</i>

1317
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:41,395
<i>I knew you'd never
be safe here on Pandora.</i>

1318
01:11:42,624 --> 01:11:44,759
<i>But if you ever return,</i>

1319
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:47,731
<i>I've made sure
that Claptrap will find you,</i>

1320
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,767
<i>help you understand...</i>

1321
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:52,967
<i>your destiny.</i>

1322
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,007
<i>Lilith, I love you.</i>

1323
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:11,183
<i>I wish...</i>

1324
01:12:12,655 --> 01:12:16,155
<i>I could hold you one last time.</i>

1325
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:28,442
Tina!

1326
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:34,143
Whoa.
That was weird.

1327
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:36,247
I blacked out.

1328
01:12:36,349 --> 01:12:39,151
Did something important happen?

1329
01:13:04,806 --> 01:13:06,247
It's saying it's here.

1330
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:07,739
All I'm seeing
is some holes.

1331
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,414
Are you sure this is it?

1332
01:13:09,516 --> 01:13:10,745
I don't know.
It's somewhere.

1333
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:12,183
Okay,
what does it look like?

1334
01:13:12,285 --> 01:13:14,147
Big. It's an arch.

1335
01:13:15,951 --> 01:13:17,917
It's here somewhere.
I know it's here.

1336
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,017
How do you know it's here?

1337
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:21,118
Because I'm feeling emotion.

1338
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,560
Can you be more specific?

1339
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:24,628
- Thing of power!
- Not right now, Krieg. Please.

1340
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:26,734
- Okay, I get it...
- But that means something!

1341
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:27,967
No, no, no!

1342
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:29,437
I'm not following.

1343
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:46,586
Krieg, you genius. You found it!

1344
01:14:04,737 --> 01:14:06,298
I have to warn you,
this might kill you.

1345
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:09,175
Me?

1346
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:12,171
Nah, kid. I'm the special one.

1347
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:14,581
Whatever this is,
it's gonna make me invincible.

1348
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:48,679
What just happened?

1349
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:51,178
I'm the special one.
It should do something.

1350
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:56,590
Apparently not.

1351
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,660
Well done, Tina.

1352
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,288
Well done.

1353
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:07,832
Amazing effort.

1354
01:15:26,754 --> 01:15:28,653
You survived the worst planet
in the galaxy.

1355
01:15:28,755 --> 01:15:31,918
You found the key
and the vault itself.

1356
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,891
You've made your father
so proud.

1357
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:38,456
Commander Knoxx,

1358
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:41,332
I need
her nervous system intact.

1359
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:43,032
Keep the organs on ice.

1360
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:47,036
Perhaps we'll have better luck
with the next clone.

1361
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:49,643
Hey, asshole.

1362
01:15:58,311 --> 01:16:00,921
That was quite
an entrance, Roland.

1363
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,281
You miss me?

1364
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:04,416
You might have saved the day
if it wasn't for...

1365
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:07,386
my Atlas auto shield.

1366
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:14,794
Kill them all.

1367
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:21,609
Hold your fire.

1368
01:16:22,209 --> 01:16:23,409
That's an order.

1369
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:24,737
<i>You heard the commander.</i>

1370
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:25,745
<i>Weapons down.</i>

1371
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:32,950
Roland, you were right.

1372
01:16:35,222 --> 01:16:36,221
I should've...

1373
01:16:40,093 --> 01:16:41,322
No!

1374
01:16:41,424 --> 01:16:42,421
No!

1375
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,358
Any other objections?

1376
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:47,558
Just one!

1377
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:52,105
That you continue breathing.

1378
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,572
But I'll allow it

1379
01:16:53,674 --> 01:16:55,643
if you let my friends
go in peace.

1380
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:58,475
And tell me, Lilith,

1381
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:00,307
just why would I do that?

1382
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:05,147
Because I'm the daughter
of Eridia.

1383
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:08,781
<i>I've seen that
before somewhere.</i>

1384
01:17:08,883 --> 01:17:09,914
<i>Firehawk.</i>

1385
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,290
<i>Eridian goddess.</i>

1386
01:17:11,392 --> 01:17:12,726
It's your planet, Lilith.

1387
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,788
You have to protect it.

1388
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,662
<i>Mama loved you.</i>

1389
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,023
She always told me
how special you were.

1390
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,261
<i>I found it.</i>

1391
01:17:21,363 --> 01:17:22,366
<i>How did...?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

1392
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:24,265
Just lucky, I guess.

1393
01:17:28,973 --> 01:17:30,475
Daughter of Eridia, baby!

1394
01:17:30,577 --> 01:17:32,178
Bet you didn't see that coming!

1395
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:35,941
But...

1396
01:17:36,043 --> 01:17:36,948
But I'm the special one.

1397
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:39,313
Oh, you are.

1398
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:41,656
Just not the way you thought.

1399
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,285
I open the vault...

1400
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:46,287
the girl goes free.

1401
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:50,823
You open the vault

1402
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:52,359
and you all go free.

1403
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:54,493
You have my word.

1404
01:17:56,603 --> 01:17:58,535
I just figured it out.

1405
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:01,374
Your mother gave you to me

1406
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,906
to take you away from here,

1407
01:18:03,008 --> 01:18:05,504
so you would never
have to open that vault.

1408
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:06,846
Well, that worked out great.

1409
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,981
I have to open it.

1410
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:15,087
No salvation without sacrifice.

1411
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,218
Remember?

1412
01:18:17,588 --> 01:18:18,616
But you can't.

1413
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,158
You can't.

1414
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:21,619
It's fine.

1415
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,291
You're safe.

1416
01:18:24,463 --> 01:18:25,458
And, Tina,

1417
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:28,326
memories are more powerful

1418
01:18:28,428 --> 01:18:31,271
than anything
Atlas could ever create.

1419
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,900
Now, you got one of me.

1420
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:50,576
Yes.

1421
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,355
Tannis, what's happening?

1422
01:20:05,457 --> 01:20:07,200
The Eridians have delivered us

1423
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,962
a champion.

1424
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:27,111
The legends were true.

1425
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:28,388
She's the Firehawk.

1426
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,989
Lilith, can you hear me?

1427
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:34,686
Take me into the vault.

1428
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,930
If you won't, I'm going
to have to hurt your friends.

1429
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,567
Pull me up!

1430
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:43,662
Lilith, help!

1431
01:21:04,187 --> 01:21:06,157
Make it rain, Tina!

1432
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,334
<i>Attack!</i>

1433
01:21:20,674 --> 01:21:21,905
Are you guys shooting?

1434
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:23,369
I'm sorry,
I didn't feel a thing.

1435
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:24,243
You get a bullet.
You get a bullet.

1436
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:25,572
Run, run.

1437
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:34,581
Interplanetary
ninja assassin mode activated.

1438
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:38,752
Step aside, bitches.

1439
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:33,871
Lilith. Lilith!

1440
01:22:35,712 --> 01:22:36,951
No!

1441
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:39,547
Lilith, can you hear me?

1442
01:22:47,928 --> 01:22:49,260
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

1443
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:56,762
Lilith. Come on, Lilith.

1444
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:05,177
Lilith.

1445
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:07,311
Please wake up.

1446
01:23:08,814 --> 01:23:10,512
Tannis, run.

1447
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:55,623
Nobody kills me but me!

1448
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:12,244
Everybody, run!

1449
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:21,715
Go! Move, move!

1450
01:24:29,663 --> 01:24:30,427
Shit!

1451
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:53,450
Tannis, you're alive.

1452
01:24:53,984 --> 01:24:55,754
I'm alive!

1453
01:24:55,856 --> 01:24:57,388
This guy, not so much.

1454
01:25:05,929 --> 01:25:06,928
A siren.

1455
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:08,025
Tina!

1456
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:09,532
Tina!

1457
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:11,534
Tina!

1458
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:17,210
Tannis, where's Tina?

1459
01:25:17,777 --> 01:25:18,772
Lilith!

1460
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,979
I warned you
not to disappoint me.

1461
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,584
Take me to the vault now.

1462
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,901
Well, shit.

1463
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:01,811
Let go of me!

1464
01:26:01,913 --> 01:26:03,157
Keep struggling
and I'll kill you.

1465
01:26:08,959 --> 01:26:10,821
Lilith!

1466
01:26:10,923 --> 01:26:11,990
Lilith, show yourself!

1467
01:26:13,759 --> 01:26:15,268
Show yourself or I kill her!

1468
01:26:16,605 --> 01:26:17,600
I'll do it!

1469
01:26:18,497 --> 01:26:19,633
Believe me.

1470
01:26:19,735 --> 01:26:20,933
Oh, I believe you.

1471
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,705
Ah, Lilith.

1472
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:26,213
This is...

1473
01:26:29,981 --> 01:26:31,350
unbelievable.

1474
01:26:34,518 --> 01:26:36,817
So much more
than I ever imagined.

1475
01:26:39,988 --> 01:26:43,562
The treasures of a race
who once ruled the galaxies.

1476
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:44,660
Look.

1477
01:26:47,133 --> 01:26:49,236
The power. Can you feel it?

1478
01:26:50,034 --> 01:26:51,469
Can you...

1479
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,572
Yeah, I can feel it.

1480
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,746
Honestly, it makes me
a little sick.

1481
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:01,572
You'll get used to it.

1482
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,173
Yeah. You see...

1483
01:27:03,275 --> 01:27:06,143
I have something that a man
like you will never have.

1484
01:27:08,953 --> 01:27:09,916
Enough.

1485
01:27:13,226 --> 01:27:14,393
Lilith.
Over here.

1486
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:17,630
Lose something?

1487
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:20,531
Tina!

1488
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:27,769
Ta-da.

1489
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:32,975
Bye-bye.

1490
01:27:33,077 --> 01:27:34,806
No, Lilith.

1491
01:27:34,908 --> 01:27:35,909
- Lilith, please.
-Don't worry.

1492
01:27:37,249 --> 01:27:38,879
You won't get lonely down here.

1493
01:27:40,721 --> 01:27:41,951
No. No.

1494
01:27:42,053 --> 01:27:43,788
No, no, no. No!

1495
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,358
Lilith! Tina!

1496
01:27:46,024 --> 01:27:48,557
No, no, no!

1497
01:28:15,254 --> 01:28:16,389

1498
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:18,589
<i>♪ So sweet ♪</i>

1499
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,030
Excuse me!
Coming through.

1500
01:28:26,132 --> 01:28:27,961
Make way for the hero!

1501
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:33,530
Hey.

1502
01:28:33,632 --> 01:28:34,407
You hear that?

1503
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:36,637
What?

1504
01:28:36,739 --> 01:28:40,237
That I think is what
peace sounds like.

1505
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:44,010
Enjoy it.

1506
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:46,149
Let's make it last.

1507
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:47,847
I made you a little tea.

1508
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:49,818
I thought you might be
a little dehydrated.

1509
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,922
All right, guys. Let's, um...

1510
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,188
Let's join the party.

1511
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:27,059
All right! Hooray!

1512
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:30,153
Whoops. Premature celebration.

1513
01:29:30,256 --> 01:29:31,521
That's never happened before.

1514
01:29:31,624 --> 01:29:32,663
You ready?

1515
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,096
We'll meet you there.

1516
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,868
I got you.

1517
01:29:36,970 --> 01:29:37,937
Come on, Krieg.

1518
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,038
Time to go get drunk.

1519
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,067
Glorious meat fiesta.

1520
01:29:44,845 --> 01:29:45,577
So...

1521
01:29:47,144 --> 01:29:48,140
Uh...

1522
01:29:49,115 --> 01:29:50,549
I don't think so.

1523
01:29:51,314 --> 01:29:52,917
Come on.

1524
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:53,849
Do the thing.

1525
01:29:56,354 --> 01:29:58,083
I'm a bit old, I think,

1526
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:00,927
to be setting myself on fire
for your amusement.

1527
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:02,187
You know you want to.

1528
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,692

01:30:06,794 --> 01:30:09,062

<i>She's dangerous.</i>

1531
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,261
<i>She's dirty.</i>

1532
01:30:12,364 --> 01:30:14,738
<i>And she's definitely
a toxic waste dump.</i>

1533
01:30:16,209 --> 01:30:17,906
<i>But, she's my home.</i>

1534
01:30:23,909 --> 01:30:25,485
What a show-off.

Woo-hoo! Check these moves.

1553
01:32:29,936 --> 01:32:32,042
I come to dance, mofo.

1554
01:32:36,108 --> 01:32:37,711
Twerk it. Work it out, now.

1555
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:38,877
Do the Claptrap. It's my...

1556
01:32:38,979 --> 01:32:40,383
Oh, hey! Hey, wait! No, no, no!

1557
01:32:40,485 --> 01:32:42,054
What's goin' on here? No!

1558
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:43,088
It's my Easter egg!

1559
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,419
Ah! You son of a...

1560
01:32:44,521 --> 01:32:46,415
Don't make me leave!

1561
01:32:46,518 --> 01:32:48,885
Not when I'm giving the people
what they want!
