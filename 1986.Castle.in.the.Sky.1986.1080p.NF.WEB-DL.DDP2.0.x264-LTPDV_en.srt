1
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,072
Pirates!

2
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,949
We're under attack!

3
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,769
Hold them off! Get down on the floor.

4
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,173
Tear gas!

5
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,062
What are you waiting for? Break it down!

6
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,322
Where'd she go?

7
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,409
There she is!

8
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,245
She's getting away!

9
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,540
Well, get her!

10
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,292
Mama, don't drop me!

11
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,839
There's the stone. Quick, go next door!

12
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,174
Get that crystal!

13
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,768
There goes the crystal.

14
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,681
Two meatballs, please.

15
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,474
Working late?

16
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,893
We're finally busy again.

17
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,479
-Still working?
-Yeah.

18
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,575
What's that?

19
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,667
A person!

20
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,597
Pazu!

21
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,935
What are you up to? Where's my dinner?

22
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,186
Boss!

23
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,647
A girl fell from the sky.

24
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,544
Boss, she fell from the sky.

25
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,841
Darn old clunker.

26
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,926
Boss! A girl...

27
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,345
Close valve number two!

28
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,066
-Pazu, toss me a wrench.
-Sure.

29
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,864
I'm busy here. You take it.

30
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,908
-Don't make them wait.
-Yes!

31
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,997
-Keep a steady hand.
-Yes!

32
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,098
Brake!

33
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,653
Any luck?

34
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,073
No silver, no tin even.

35
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,742
All that wasted work.

36
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,078
Should we try the east vein?

37
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,955
That's riddled with old holes.

38
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,083
We'll have to start over.

39
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,251
That's enough for today.

40
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,672
Push!

41
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,934
Shut down the boiler. Call it a day.

42
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,685
I'll go under at this rate.

43
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,401
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

44
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,569
Yes!

45
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,505
Mama, we couldn't find her. It's too dark.

46
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,298
I hope you really looked!

47
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,885
All right. We'll wait for daylight.

48
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,797
Hi. How are you feeling?

49
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,383
Hey, come on guys...

50
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,393
I'm Pazu. I live here by myself.

51
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,770
They eat after I play.

52
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,950
So you are human after all.

53
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,120
I was afraid you were an angel.

54
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,706
Thanks for helping me.

55
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm Sheeta.

56
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,127
Sheeta, nice name.

57
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
You fell from the sky. A bit scary.

58
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,800
That's right. Why am I still alive?

59
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,136
I fell from the airship...

60
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,014
-Have you forgotten?
-Yes.

61
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,313
Say, can I see that?

62
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,107
-This?
-Yes.

63
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,821
It's been in my family forever.

64
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,532
It's beautiful.

65
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:27,992
Wait...

66
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,588
Watch this!

67
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,095
Pazu!

68
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,655
So it wasn't the stone after all.

69
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,381
Pazu!

70
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,512
Oh, no! Pazu!

71
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,517
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Are you?

72
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,727
I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt?

73
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,148
No, my head's harder than my boss's fists.

74
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,698
The pot's still boiling.

75
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,366
Hungry? Let's eat.

76
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,368
Wash up over there.

77
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,540
-There's a towel.
-Thank you.

78
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,435
Laputa...

79
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,358
Sheeta! Where are you?

80
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,287
My father took that picture.

81
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,290
That's Laputa, an island in the sky.

82
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,501
An island in the sky?

83
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,544
They say it's only a myth.

84
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,297
But my father saw it.

85
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,337
He took it from an airship.

86
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,551
There's a Laputa in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>,
but Swift made it up.

87
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,844
Dad drew this.

88
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,016
He said the abandoned palace
was full of treasure.

89
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,477
But nobody believed him.

90
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,482
Until he died, they called him a liar.

91
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,199
But my father never lied.

92
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,288
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa!

93
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,843
A real automobile...

94
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,511
They're pirates!

95
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,556
They attacked the airship.

96
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,559
-Are they after you?
-Yes.

97
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,560
Quick!

98
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,943
-Morning!
-Hey, wait!

99
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,821
We're in a rush.

100
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
Have you seen a girl?

101
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,286
Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...

102
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,538
Off you go!

103
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,793
They're looking for you.

104
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,755
Louis, a girl's dress!

105
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,175
What! She was disguised! Tell Mama!

106
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,092
All right!

107
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,517
Haven't seen her.

108
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,687
A cute little girl. Brown hair, braids...

109
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,022
Boss!

110
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,899
Boss!

111
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,486
About that age.

112
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,783
Hey!

113
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,326
That's her!

114
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,749
Pirates! They're chasing her.

115
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,672
Pirates! Lemme see!

116
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,092
Not one step closer.

117
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,594
Hand her over.

118
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,638
-Pirates, eh?
-Dola's clan.

119
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,641
Go home. Just poor folk here.

120
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,852
-Ma'am?
-Scoot out the back.

121
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,104
I want to fight.

122
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,648
-They've got weapons!
-But...

123
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,818
What a pretty girl. Better protect her.

124
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,448
You refuse to step aside?

125
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,409
Use your fists.

126
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,910
Could be interesting.

127
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,746
Get him, brother.

128
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,344
Show your stuff.

129
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,895
Wow.

130
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,650
Who's going to mend that shirt?

131
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,795
You can beat him!

132
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,763
That's it, hit him!

133
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,184
Off you go!

134
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,375
Think you can fool me? After them!

135
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:42,885
Climb on!

136
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,431
There you go.

137
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,602
Playing hooky for a date?

138
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,229
Bad guys are after us.

139
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,485
-The Dola clan.
-Pirates?

140
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,445
Take us to the next town. To the police!

141
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,531
You're on. Stoke the fire.

142
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,573
Okay.

143
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,206
Mama!

144
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,962
You idiots! Hurry up and get on!

145
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,464
What? But the girl's...

146
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,342
She slipped out the back door. Get moving!

147
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,553
Brother!

148
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,429
Wait!

149
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,292
They're catching up, more steam!

150
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,336
Can't you go any faster?

151
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,630
She's an old-timer.

152
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,219
-Move over!
-Whoa!

153
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,563
Mama, I can't hang on!

154
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,039
More steam, they're gaining on us!

155
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,126
Here we go!

156
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,170
Sheeta, over here.

157
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,007
-Stoke the fire.
-Okay!

158
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
Don't give up!

159
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,820
Push! Push, I tell you!

160
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,209
Not so fast!

161
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,548
Don't let them escape!

162
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,218
Dump this over the side!

163
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,973
-That'll teach them!
-I'll do it.

164
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,350
No, let me.

165
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,564
Up we go! Up we go!

166
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,774
Wait!

167
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,364
It's them. What'll we do?

168
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,783
I refuse to give up. Move!

169
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,051
This is a surprise. If it isn't the army!

170
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:22,146
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.

171
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,032
Sheeta?

172
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,453
Goodbye. Wait!

173
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,665
Sheeta!

174
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,917
Halt or I'll shoot.

175
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,049
An armored train.

176
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,718
Who cares! Ram it!

177
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,181
What is it, Sheeta!

178
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,932
Stay away!

179
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,475
They're gonna fall!

180
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,019
Quiet. Watch closely.

181
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,920
We're floating!

182
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,637
Look! It's that crystal!

183
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,601
It was the stone after all! Amazing!

184
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,828
We'll float all the way down.

185
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,712
Amazing! I want it!

186
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,255
Fire!

187
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,600
I have to get that amazing stone!

188
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,416
-It's fading...
-Hey, wait!

189
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,636
It's just like when you landed.

190
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,098
The opening looks so tiny.

191
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,728
I hope the boss and the engineer
aren't in any trouble.

192
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,898
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.

193
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,150
Come on, let's find the way out.

194
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,241
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.

195
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,713
There.

196
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,175
I'm so happy. I was starving.

197
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,595
I've still got an apple and some candy.

198
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,725
It's like you have a magical bag
that holds everything.

199
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,951
Gondoa? That's so far north.

200
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,162
Yes. Both my parents died,

201
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,331
but they left me the house and the fields,

202
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,333
so I was getting by on my own.

203
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,983
Those guys with dark glasses
kidnapped you?

204
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:18,984
Yes.

205
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,610
That guy was one of them?

206
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,531
Who can they be, calling in the army?

207
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,119
Dola and the other guys,
they all want the stone.

208
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:33,749
But I had no idea
it had mysterious powers.

209
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,836
It was always in our family.

210
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,422
Mother left it to me when she died.

211
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,092
She warned me never to show it
or give it to anyone.

212
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,806
We're both orphans, aren't we?

213
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,477
I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.

214
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,230
When you fell from the sky
my heart was racing.

215
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,566
I knew something wonderful had begun.

216
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,708
Little demons... Little demons.

217
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,836
Uncle Pom! He's really great.

218
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,962
Uncle Pom.

219
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,799
We've lost our way.

220
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,469
Now that little demon
sure looks like Pazu...

221
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,391
With a little girl demon beside him.

222
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,476
Pirates are after us.

223
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,978
And the army.

224
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,483
How very extraordinary.

225
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,204
Drink up.

226
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,414
Thank you.

227
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,084
Have you always lived underground?

228
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,003
Why, no, no.

229
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,049
The rocks have been stirring...

230
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,136
That's when I like to be down here.

231
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,470
The rocks were stirring?

232
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,860
Rocks speak very softly.

233
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,895
Wonderful...

234
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,397
Pazu, look at that!

235
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,578
They were ordinary rocks until...

236
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,205
How pretty...

237
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,249
Here, let me show you.

238
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,136
It's gone.

239
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,890
These rocks contain volucite.

240
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,099
Volucite?

241
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:45,398
As soon as it's exposed to the air,
it becomes ordinary stone.

242
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,113
It's glowing...

243
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,869
Oh, my gracious!
That's a volucite crystal, my dear.

244
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,498
I've never seen one before.

245
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,419
That's why the rocks were stirring.

246
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,464
This stone has mysterious powers.

247
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:16,179
I thought only Laputans
knew how to make volucite crystals.

248
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,973
Laputans?

249
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,269
They used Volucite to send
a magnificent island aloft...

250
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:26,481
Laputa did exist, Sheeta! It really did!

251
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,776
Does the island still exist?

252
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,988
Uncle Pom?

253
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,533
Dear, would you mind covering the stone?

254
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,243
Its power overwhelms me.

255
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,787
Yes.

256
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,832
What's wrong?

257
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,303
My grandfather told me...

258
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:01,558
the rocks stir
when Laputa floats overhead.

259
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,228
If you went up to the sky then,
you'd find Laputa!

260
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,939
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!

261
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,359
Young lady...

262
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,321
-You see...
-Yes?

263
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,700
Your stone is most powerful...

264
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,705
I know that.
I've been speaking to rocks all my life.

265
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,208
A stone so powerful brings happiness,

266
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,712
but it also often brings misery.

267
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,547
I see.

268
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,217
What's more,
your stone is the work of men.

269
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,970
How on earth did you...

270
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,806
The stone's not dangerous!

271
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,976
It already saved Sheeta twice!

272
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,980
Amazing! Laputa really does exist!

273
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,199
It's gone.

274
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,368
Let's go back to the ship.

275
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:05,288
When it's this quiet,
it's best to stay put.

276
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,750
I'm hungry...

277
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,462
It's all clear. Let's go.

278
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,923
Thank you, Uncle.

279
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,675
Look after yourselves.

280
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,697
Look at those clouds!

281
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,633
Beyond those clouds is an island
we've only dreamed of.

282
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,389
Here I come! I know
I'm going to find Laputa!

283
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,390
Pazu...

284
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,309
I haven't told you everything.

285
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:14,566
My family had a mysterious,
ancient name...

286
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,818
that came with this stone.

287
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,739
My name is Lucita,

288
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,242
Lucita Toelle Ur.... Laputa.

289
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,077
Laputa?

290
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,662
So you mean...

291
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,042
It's the army! Run!

292
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,424
Underground!

293
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,762
Don't move!

294
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,846
How dare you!

295
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,725
Pazu! Let me go!

296
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,063
Pazu! Pazu!

297
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,276
-We've apprehended them.
-Good work.

298
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,063
Open up, open up!

299
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,611
Sheeta...

300
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,660
Company, march!

301
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,066
Use force!

302
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,945
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.

303
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,072
Spoken like a man in uniform.

304
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,826
In your haste, you risk everything.

305
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,582
If we'd mobilized sooner,
we'd have bagged Dola too.

306
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,377
She managed to decipher
your third-rate code.

307
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,795
What!

308
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,172
My organization will handle this.

309
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,177
Concentrate on mobilizing
the troops when the time is ripe.

310
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,933
Muska! Remember, I command
the search for Laputa!

311
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:59,480
Of course. But I have my orders
from the government.

312
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,361
That pencil-pushing upstart!

313
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:23,963
Have a nice rest?

314
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,133
Where's Pazu? Let me see him!

315
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,801
No interest in pretty clothes?

316
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,262
Don't fret about Pazu.

317
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,015
His stubborn head is harder than mine.

318
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,560
Come, I have something to show you.

319
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,660
Enter.

320
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,596
What is it?

321
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,642
A mechanical soldier
with vast destructive power.

322
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,480
Until he fell from the sky,
no one believed Laputa was real.

323
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,417
He's not of this earth.

324
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,420
Our science can't even identify...

325
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,715
what material he's made of.

326
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,967
Look...

327
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,427
Don't be afraid.

328
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,595
He's long dead.

329
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,520
Look at that.

330
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,779
This insignia
was carved on your fireplace.

331
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,073
It's on this stone, too.

332
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,286
The stone works only in your hands.

333
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,665
It protects its owner

334
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:27,086
and will guide her back to Laputa.

335
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,881
I know nothing of this!

336
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,508
Take it if you like.

337
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,886
Just leave us alone...

338
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,644
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa
is some kind of treasure island.

339
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,066
Fearsome scientific power
thrust Laputa into orbit.

340
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,319
Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth!

341
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,908
Even you can appreciate
that when such an entity roams the skies,

342
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,661
it threatens peace.

343
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,331
I need your cooperation.

344
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:09,087
You must know how to make
the stone guide us to Laputa.

345
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,466
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!

346
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,928
I intend no harm,

347
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,264
but his fate rests with you.

348
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,557
What?

349
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,856
The boy goes free
if you assist us, Lucita...

350
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,359
Toelle Ur Laputa.

351
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,112
But how...

352
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,865
Ur means ruler. Toelle means True.

353
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,120
You are Princess Lucita,
rightful heir to the Laputan throne.

354
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,307
Out!

355
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,311
Sheeta!

356
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,188
Pazu, are you hurt?

357
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,483
I'm fine. You?
Did they do anything horrible?

358
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,611
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.

359
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,614
We didn't know how gallantly...

360
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,826
you protected her from the pirates.

361
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,119
Sheeta, what did you...

362
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,081
Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa.

363
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,500
What!

364
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,797
Sheeta will aid us
in our search for Laputa.

365
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,426
I understand how you feel,
but forget about her.

366
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,344
Is this true, Sheeta? But we...

367
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,139
Thank you for everything.

368
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,183
I'll never forget you, Pazu.

369
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,185
I don't believe it...

370
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,604
Sheeta, we promised!

371
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:50,938
Farewell!

372
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:51,898
Sheeta!

373
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,816
Wait, Sheeta!

374
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,902
Be reasonable. Act like a man.

375
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,696
Sheeta!

376
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,457
Here's a token of our gratitude.

377
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,791
It's yours.

378
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,999
Only you can recall the words
that will waken this stone.

379
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,962
If you keep your promise,
you too shall be free.

380
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,552
Pazu...

381
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,618
Mama, it's Pazu! He's back!

382
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,705
Pazu.

383
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,875
We were so worried. You just disappeared.

384
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,296
-And the girl?
-Forget it.

385
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,175
Pazu!

386
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,961
Let me go! What are you doing?

387
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,464
Put a lid on it!

388
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,091
Nice place you got, kid.

389
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,509
Get out!

390
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,763
This is my house!

391
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,183
Oh, come off it.

392
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,393
Can't even protect a little girl...

393
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,063
-What do you say?
-He's got gold!

394
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,441
Sold her for money, huh?

395
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,485
No! I wouldn't do that!

396
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,237
You let them pay you off?

397
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,824
Sheeta told me to do it.

398
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,701
So...

399
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,872
So you gave in and crawled home.

400
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,458
You call yourself a man?

401
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,462
You talk big, but you're after Sheeta too.

402
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,339
But of course, we're pirates.

403
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,467
Pirates hunt for treasure.

404
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,472
Those guys are strange ones.
What's the girl to them?

405
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:19,480
You think she'll get out alive?

406
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,029
So, Sheeta told you to leave?

407
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,491
They threatened her,
so she tried to save you.

408
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,827
How do you know, Mama?

409
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,663
I've been a woman for 50 years.

410
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,917
She steels her heart
to save her man. How touching.

411
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,211
Reminds me of my youth.

412
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,507
If you boys want to get married,
look for one like her.

413
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,511
-So that girl will grow up...
-To be like Mama?

414
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,976
What a waste.

415
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,858
I've got all your codes.

416
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,361
Calling the battle cruiser?

417
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:20,416
They'll pack her up and take off?
We better hurry!

418
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,626
Dinner's over. Move out.

419
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,420
Yes, Mama.

420
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,507
Going after Sheeta?

421
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,051
We want the crystal, not the girl.

422
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,680
The stone's no good without her.

423
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,683
Can't I go with you?

424
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,685
I have to help Sheeta!

425
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,689
Do it on your own, like a man.

426
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,065
You're right,

427
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,068
if I was clever and strong,
I could've defended her.

428
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,362
Please, I don't care about treasure.

429
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,532
-Listen to him...
-Shut up!

430
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,742
Yes!

431
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,418
He could probably help us with her...

432
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,297
You'll be an outcast forever.

433
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,633
-I know.
-You sure?

434
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,717
Yup!

435
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,137
Be ready in 40 seconds.

436
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,606
Take care, you guys.

437
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,326
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.

438
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,610
A magnificent vessel.

439
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,904
Has the girl talked?

440
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,239
I need a little more time.

441
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,201
Forget it! We'll squeeze
it out of her up there.

442
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,371
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

443
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,977
Step on it, it's almost dawn!

444
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,568
Sheeta!

445
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,886
Whatever shall we do?

446
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,517
Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you...

447
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,354
a magic spell for trouble.

448
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,563
A magic spell?

449
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,941
Yes.
These are old, old, old secret words.

450
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,414
They mean "help me rekindle the light."

451
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,203
Perfect.

452
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:37,381
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.

453
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,465
Sacred light?

454
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,516
What are the magic words? Tell me.

455
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,819
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

456
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,706
It's moving!

457
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,463
The robot, it's alive!

458
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,506
Hello!

459
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,354
Help!

460
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,237
It's alive! It's the robot!

461
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,038
The robot?

462
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,718
It's coming this way.

463
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,225
Run!

464
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,526
Retreat! Retreat!

465
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,279
Incredible!

466
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,330
I see!

467
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,333
It's the light!

468
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,836
The sacred light broke his seal!

469
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,923
The way to Laputa is open! Come!

470
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,840
No!

471
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,488
It can fly!

472
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,916
It's pointing to the sky...

473
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,549
It's showing the way to Laputa.

474
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,968
Hurry!

475
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,680
Explosives?
Idiot! You'll blow up the fortress!

476
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,935
Hello, hello! What is this!

477
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,938
-Good.
-We're connected.

478
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,192
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot cut communication with the ship.

479
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,695
I've assumed emergency command.

480
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,615
It's after the girl on the tower.

481
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,784
Take it down on sight.

482
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,828
Prepare to fire.

483
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,628
Hurry! Hurry up!

484
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,109
Fire!

485
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,794
Hurry!

486
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,924
-We did it.
-Amazing!

487
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,175
Get the girl.

488
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,848
Is she dead?

489
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,932
Get up!

490
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,353
-She just fainted.
-Stand!

491
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,606
It moved...

492
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,533
What's that? Looks like a war.

493
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,244
-Let's go, Dola!
-That's Captain, to you!

494
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,294
Lower, Charles.

495
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,315
Stop! Stop it!

496
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,900
Please!

497
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,370
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!

498
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,922
We're going directly into
the crossfire. Regroup!

499
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,966
-Look, there's Sheeta!
-Where?

500
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,344
Where?

501
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,639
Straight ahead.
She's on top of that tower!

502
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,484
This is a job for a woman! Cover me.

503
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,290
Sheeta!

504
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,169
I'm coming, Sheeta!

505
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,920
Pazu!

506
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,716
Fly closer!

507
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,846
Pazu!

508
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,599
Let me go!

509
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,787
Sheeta!

510
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,499
Dola!

511
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,006
Pazu!

512
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,643
Pazu!

513
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,248
Pull up!

514
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,507
Last chance! Grab her on the fly!

515
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,426
Pazu!

516
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,553
-Here goes!
-All right!

517
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,516
Move aside! Damn!

518
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,600
Sheeta!

519
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,858
What's Goliath doing?

520
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,449
A smoke screen?

521
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,507
Where's the robot?

522
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,926
Destroyed. The girl went that way.

523
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,303
What!

524
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,853
Put out the fire! Organize a search party!

525
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,578
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

526
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,249
Its light points to Laputa...

527
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:01,379
Inform the general, we'll depart
for Laputa as planned.

528
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,668
Lucky guy...

529
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:45,173
I can't believe she'll grow up
to be just like Mama...

530
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,681
There's your valley...
Right back where we started.

531
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,061
Dola, please take us aboard.

532
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,938
Call me Captain!

533
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,274
What use are you without the crystal?

534
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,110
We'll work.

535
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,238
I want to see Laputa for myself.

536
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:19,249
Don't want any treasure?
You just want to see Laputa?

537
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,001
Suspect motives
for boarding a pirate ship.

538
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,629
Are they coming with us, Mama?

539
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,424
One false move and you're shark bait!

540
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,594
Excellent! No more laundry
or cleaning duty!

541
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,263
Or dish washing!

542
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,099
Or potato peeling!

543
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,481
-Can you make pudding?
-Yes...

544
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,442
I like mincemeat pie.

545
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:49,446
I eat, uhm... anything!

546
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,406
Enough out of you!

547
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,200
When will those boys ever grow up?

548
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:41,915
Get off!

549
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,338
Canvas. It's made of cloth.

550
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,839
And don't tear it.

551
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,384
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

552
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,434
Hurry, this way!

553
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,937
I hate dawdlers.

554
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,064
You're with me!

555
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,232
Pazu!

556
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,942
I don't bite. Come.

557
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,111
You're not here for fun.

558
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,618
What an engine.

559
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:23,122
Now where'd he go? Pops! Pops!

560
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,377
Look, we got you an assistant.

561
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,547
Don't holler.

562
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,131
I hear you.

563
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,971
He's tougher than Mama. Be careful.

564
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,311
My hand doesn't fit.

565
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,815
This gasket?

566
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,316
-Name?
-Pazu.

567
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:56,406
The crystal pointed nearly due east...

568
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,575
You sure about that?

569
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,828
I could see the sunrise from the tower.

570
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,122
It's the harvest season now...

571
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,334
so the sun rises just south of due east.

572
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,421
The light pointed to the left
of where the sun rose.

573
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,881
Good answer. Any luck?

574
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,634
Not a peep.

575
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,470
They're maintaining radio silence,
aren't they?

576
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:22,515
Mama, Goliath's faster. What do we do?

577
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,685
We're upwind of them.

578
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,521
If we get a lift on the trade winds...

579
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,524
My abacus from the Far East.

580
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:33,818
Windspeed is 10... and...

581
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,529
I think we can catch up.

582
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,825
Okay, listen up!

583
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,120
<i>Goliath's on its way to Laputa.</i>

584
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,831
<i>We're on their tail.</i>

585
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,043
<i>With these winds,</i>
<i>I expect contact tomorrow.</i>

586
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:54,088
<i>Ten gold pieces</i>
<i>to whoever spots her first!</i>

587
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,048
Ten!

588
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,383
<i>Whatever we find,</i>

589
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,887
<i>I'm sure Laputa has riches enough</i>
<i>for any pirate gang!</i>

590
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,890
Earn your keep, boys!

591
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,691
Now!

592
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,493
Course 98, speed 40.

593
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,317
That getup of yours won't work.

594
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,070
Wear these.

595
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,958
Your station.

596
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:16,713
Beautiful...

597
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,430
You serve five meals a day.

598
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,640
Go easy on the water.

599
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,109
Get to work, you idiots!

600
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,787
Yes?

601
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:38,044
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.

602
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,005
I've never cooked on an airship...

603
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,258
Do you need something?

604
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,513
-Beautiful...
-What?

605
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:53,226
I thought I'd give you
a hand in my spare time.

606
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,769
Why thank you.

607
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,271
Can you put those dishes away?

608
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,981
Happy to obli...

609
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,987
You said your stomach hurt...

610
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,740
I've got some free time. Can I...

611
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,743
You're in the way.

612
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,454
Some stomachache, jerk!

613
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,664
Hey, can I help...

614
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:29,679
You've changed, chasing the likes
of Goliath...

615
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,806
But it's pointless.

616
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,267
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.

617
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,563
They're certainly nice kids...

618
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,898
Get to the point, you old goat.

619
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:45,403
They're too upright and honest
to ever respect you.

620
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,529
What's that!

621
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,240
No, I mean... Check...

622
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,035
Excellent... delicious...

623
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,958
Seconds anyone?

624
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,627
-Okay.
-More! More! More!

625
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,981
Hey, shake a leg.

626
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,194
It's your watch.

627
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,863
Take it, it's cold.

628
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,698
-Watch?
-Yeah.

629
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,706
Darn cold! Go on up.

630
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:49,133
-My turn.
-Great.

631
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,272
Sheeta!

632
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,654
That was scary!

633
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,698
The sky is beautiful.

634
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,212
Sheeta. Get in.

635
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,676
<i>Can't you sleep?</i>

636
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,595
<i>Nice and warm...</i>

637
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,430
<i>Look aft.</i>

638
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:41,394
Pazu?

639
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,104
What?

640
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,690
I'm really scared.

641
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:49,235
<i>I really don't want to go to Laputa.</i>

642
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,989
<i>I hope we never find Goliath.</i>

643
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,909
<i>-You mean--</i>
<i>-No, the light pointed the right way.</i>

644
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,619
<i>But...</i>

645
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,247
<i>You mean the robot?</i>

646
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,792
<i>Poor thing.</i>

647
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:10,423
<i>I never dreamed</i>
<i>that little spell would work.</i>

648
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,553
<i>I learned lots of other spells.</i>

649
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,347
<i>To help find things, cure the sick.</i>

650
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,850
<i>And one I must never, ever use.</i>

651
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,560
<i>Never, ever use?</i>

652
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,936
<i>A spell of destruction.</i>

653
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:30,735
<i>I had to learn bad ones</i>
<i>so the good spells had power.</i>

654
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,779
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.

655
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,742
That stone should be locked away.

656
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,245
They hid it in the fireplace.

657
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,247
It was only worn for weddings.

658
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:48,461
<i>My mother's and grandmother's</i>
<i>and great-grandmother's.</i>

659
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,048
I should have thrown it away.

660
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:56,135
You're wrong. We met thanks to the stone.

661
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,638
Throwing it away
won't make Laputa disappear.

662
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,685
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.

663
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,522
<i>I don't know what to do,</i>

664
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,816
<i>but if Laputa is so dangerous...</i>

665
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,319
<i>it's not for the likes of Muska.</i>

666
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,029
Besides...

667
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:19,116
If we run now, they'll hunt us forever.

668
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,952
But don't become a pirate for me.

669
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,663
I won't become a pirate.

670
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:28,751
<i>Dola understands.</i>
<i>She's nicer than she looks.</i>

671
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:33,172
Once things are settled,
I'll take you to Gondoa.

672
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:38,177
I want to see where you were born,
the valley, the yaks...

673
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:40,596
<i>Pazu...</i>

674
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,682
<i>What's that!</i>

675
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,976
Below us, look!

676
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,778
Goliath, right below us!

677
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,785
Come about! Full rudder!

678
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,402
We should go after them.
They'll be trouble if we don't!

679
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,779
We can't catch them in these clouds.

680
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,324
We'll get them. They won't go far.

681
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,077
Steady as she goes.

682
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,758
We're farther north than I thought.

683
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:02,261
Pazu, listen up! Time's running out.

684
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,222
<i>If we lose Goliath, it's all over.</i>

685
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,601
<i>Your eyes are sharp.</i>
<i>Track them from the crow's nest.</i>

686
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,602
What do I do?

687
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,105
That lookout post is a glider.
See the crank?

688
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,066
Yeah.
<i>-Turn it clockwise.</i>

689
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:22,615
Once it's locked,
the upper lever unfolds the wings.

690
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:31,373
<i>Use the wire to stabilize them.</i>
<i>Figure out how to steer as you go!</i>

691
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,084
-Sheeta, you there?
-<i>Yes.</i>

692
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,795
Get back down here.
<i>-Why?</i>

693
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,131
Because you're a girl!

694
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,842
But so are you!

695
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,094
Besides,
I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes.

696
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,013
-Sheeta!
-Please.

697
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,389
Pazu agrees.

698
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,020
Once you're aloft,
the voice tube won't work.

699
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,813
See the head set?

700
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,400
<i>You mean this, right?</i>

701
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,693
Wow...

702
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,696
Okay. I'll give it a try. Release us.

703
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,615
<i>Here goes.</i>

704
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,552
They're gone.

705
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,221
Slipped into the clouds.

706
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,224
<i>Look sharp! They could be anywhere.</i>

707
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,017
Aye!

708
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,021
Hold on tight.

709
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,612
<i>What's wrong!</i>

710
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,364
We're fine.

711
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,866
Just ran into a gust of wind.

712
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,287
We're keeping watch.

713
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,914
-Scared?
-No.

714
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,543
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.

715
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,424
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.

716
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,675
Okay.

717
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,470
-Tie yourself to me.
-Okay.

718
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,184
The mercury's dropping, Mama...

719
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,937
Lousy luck. Storm coming up...

720
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,314
How long 'til dawn?

721
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,565
One more hour.

722
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,333
It's dawn.

723
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,420
Strange that the sun's rising
on that side...

724
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:45,215
I know! We're supposed
to be heading east. Bridge!

725
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,010
What! We're heading north?

726
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,887
The compass is pointing east.

727
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,557
The shifting winds
must have put us off course.

728
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,894
<i>-Look!</i>
-What is it? Goliath?

729
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,355
<i>It's a cloud. A huge one...</i>

730
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,231
A cloud?

731
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,359
It's headed for us!

732
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,457
A castle in the sky...

733
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,668
We're headed into a low pressure system.

734
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,463
Turn her away, full speed!

735
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,858
It's sucking us in.

736
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,527
<i>Hold tight, we can't help!</i>

737
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,494
The helm won't move!

738
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,788
Where's your brute strength?

739
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,666
Engine's burning up!

740
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,086
Stop whining and figure something out!

741
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:06,922
We're clearing the clouds!

742
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,431
Sheeta, the ocean!

743
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,445
The Dragon's Lair!

744
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,947
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

745
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,961
Just as Dad said.
The wind's blowing the other way.

746
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,926
Look out, a wall of wind!

747
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,345
Mama! It's sucking us in!

748
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,848
Don't give up! Be a man!

749
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,184
<i>Bridge! It's Laputa!</i>

750
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,477
What was that?

751
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,813
Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair.

752
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,484
Don't be ridiculous!
It'll tear you to pieces!

753
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,569
Pazu! Look.

754
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:15,866
Just what we need.

755
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:31,882
Let's go for it! Dad did it.
He made it back.

756
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,134
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!

757
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,066
Got 'em!

758
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:52,194
Our ship's in danger. We must withdraw.

759
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,862
-Stay on course.
-What?

760
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,032
The light's pointing right into the cloud.

761
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,828
Laputa's in there.

762
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,123
Stay on course. We'll find a way in.

763
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,596
-Here we go, Sheeta!
-Okay.

764
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:21,278
Sheeta, Sheeta! Are you all right?

765
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,243
Look...

766
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,009
Laputa...

767
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:47,137
I'm sorry.

768
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,057
Wait... I tied it really tight.

769
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,271
My hands are shaking...

770
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:16,708
We did it!

771
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,479
Birds...

772
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,440
Where is everyone?

773
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,036
Coming to greet you?

774
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,539
But I don't have the stone.

775
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,665
I'll cut the rope.

776
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:19,187
-What are you doing!
-Wait.

777
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:23,191
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.

778
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,293
A flycatcher's nest!

779
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,877
That's why he's here?

780
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,678
See? All your eggs are fine.

781
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,138
The birds aren't afraid.

782
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,147
It says to follow.

783
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,232
-You understand it?
-Just intuition.

784
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,175
It's a city...

785
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,372
What an amazing place...

786
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,169
You can see the sky!

787
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:20,725
If their science
was so advanced, what happened?

788
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,370
It's a grave.
I wish I could read the writing.

789
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,624
Someone left flowers.

790
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,464
Do you leave the flowers?

791
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,342
-Pazu!
-It's a different robot!

792
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,933
It must've broken down long ago...

793
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,740
Probably a gardener robot.

794
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,078
It protected this place
even after the people went away.

795
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:21,513
You picked flowers for the grave.

796
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:25,683
Thank you.

797
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,771
Are you all alone?

798
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,607
Are there any other robots here?

799
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,969
He doesn't seem to be lonely.

800
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:05,265
He's got friends and birds' nests
to look after...

801
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:23,116
This way!

802
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,546
This section's been destroyed.

803
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:58,109
They got the <i>Tiger Moth.</i>

804
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:00,028
I hope the pirates are okay.

805
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:04,198
Sheeta, look there!

806
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,284
They're prisoners!

807
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:08,953
They hang pirates.

808
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,872
-We must help them.
-Let's go!

809
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:19,047
We found a way in.

810
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,549
Look at this, mountains of treasure.

811
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:24,552
W... What?

812
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,304
Wow...

813
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,432
Want some?

814
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,143
I'll give you plenty of rope.

815
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:35,146
Have you reported that we found Laputa?

816
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,064
Just about to.

817
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:39,567
Make the code good and complicated.

818
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:43,071
Hey! No looting!

819
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,532
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

820
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,468
What amazing roots.

821
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,387
You can climb trees, can't you?

822
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,015
I see a way.

823
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:46,467
No better than thieves.

824
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,554
If they reach the garden...!

825
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,931
Sheeta, let's find the stone!

826
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,894
It's the only way to stop them.

827
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,439
I was wondering why the clouds parted.

828
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:03,443
It was so they could land.

829
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,112
Was it my spell?

830
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:09,949
Muska was right. The seal's broken.

831
01:37:11,034 --> 01:37:13,161
The kingdom's waking up.

832
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,456
It's welcomed the visitor with the stone.

833
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,459
But Muska will become king.

834
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,837
He's got much worse in mind.

835
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,883
But what do I do
when I get the stone back...

836
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:29,594
Wait, that spell!

837
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:33,306
You mean... the destruction spell?

838
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,251
Down and around.

839
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,063
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

840
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,250
It's here somewhere.

841
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,303
Please, God...

842
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:01,394
This is it!

843
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:13,406
It's that kid.

844
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,411
No!

845
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:19,662
Don't shoot! Capture her.

846
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:24,584
Well, if it isn't the little princess.

847
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,377
Sheeta! Damn!

848
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,965
What is it, Colonel?

849
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,469
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.

850
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,638
Yes sir!

851
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,351
Sheeta, wait for me!

852
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:44,478
Pazu!

853
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:48,900
Grenades!

854
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:50,902
Is that Pazu?

855
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:55,990
What was that?

856
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,618
No, it wasn't.

857
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,876
-What's wrong?
-Over here!

858
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:08,878
The general is over there.

859
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:12,298
Militia, fall in on the double.

860
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:20,223
Dola!

861
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:22,016
They've got Sheeta.

862
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:25,394
I'm going after her. I'll cut your ropes.

863
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:35,655
Get out of here.

864
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:37,406
Hey, wait!

865
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:41,118
Take this.

866
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:43,996
Thanks.

867
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,168
The boy has become a man.

868
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:50,544
What!

869
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:54,131
Muska destroyed all the radio equipment?

870
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:57,051
Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded.

871
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,929
Several guards are badly wounded.

872
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:02,306
The colonel entered
the inner palace with the girl.

873
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,225
The soldiers saw him.

874
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:08,479
That upstart's finally showing his colors.

875
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,314
Hunt him down and arrest him!

876
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:11,732
All units!

877
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,317
Hey! Hurry!

878
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,153
Shoot if he resists!

879
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:18,155
Find the entrance.

880
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,346
Where are we, Colonel?

881
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,056
Laputa's core.

882
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,058
The castle above is just a trifle.

883
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:50,646
All of Laputa's knowledge
is crystallized here.

884
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,195
You two wait here.

885
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,572
Colonel!

886
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,576
Only royalty may enter the sacred area.

887
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:07,955
What is this!

888
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,877
The roots have invaded...

889
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:18,215
Eventually, we'll burn them all.

890
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,092
Come, this way.

891
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,855
Darn it...

892
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:34,857
Yes...

893
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,359
This is it!

894
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:45,326
Here, too!

895
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:50,998
Screw it...

896
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,259
Found it!

897
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:08,349
Behold the giant crystal!

898
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:11,685
Source of Laputa's power.

899
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:13,437
Fantastic.

900
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:16,982
It has awaited the king's return
for 700 years.

901
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,484
700 years?

902
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:22,905
Your family forgot even that?

903
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:32,540
The black rock! As the epics described!

904
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:41,298
I can read it. I know what it says!

905
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:44,301
Just who are you?

906
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:50,766
I too have an ancient,
secret name, Lucita.

907
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:53,811
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.

908
01:43:57,189 --> 01:44:01,318
We are descended
from the same royal family.

909
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:04,822
Later it split into two branches.

910
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:17,960
Not even a crack. It's indestructible.

911
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:20,463
Deploy all our explosives.

912
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:24,049
<i>Force won't be necessary, Your Excellency.</i>

913
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:25,468
Muska, where are you!

914
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:24,360
<i>What are you waiting for, General?</i>

915
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,988
All right, after me!

916
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,460
Forward!

917
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:46,215
What is this! Muska, where are you?

918
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:47,925
<i>Silence!</i>

919
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,557
What on earth!

920
01:45:56,976 --> 01:45:58,769
<i>Watch your tongue.</i>

921
01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:00,980
<i>You're in the presence of Laputa's king.</i>

922
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:02,982
Are you insane?

923
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:09,238
<i>Let's celebrate Laputa's return</i>
<i>with a demonstration of its power.</i>

924
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,365
Sheeta!

925
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:14,743
<i>Behold Laputa's thunder!</i>

926
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,704
Sheeta.

927
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:42,980
<i>It's the heavenly fire that</i>
<i>destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

928
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:46,984
<i>It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.</i>

929
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:51,238
<i>The world shall bow down</i>
<i>before Laputa once more!</i>

930
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,993
Wonderful, Muska. You're a hero.

931
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:58,412
A monumental achievement.

932
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,375
What?

933
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,255
<i>I grow tired of your stupid face.</i>

934
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:12,593
Run, everyone!

935
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,095
<i>Die!</i>

936
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:44,291
-It's those monsters!
-Look at them...

937
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:45,709
Run!

938
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:52,299
Are the Flaptors okay?

939
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:55,219
Ready to fly!

940
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:56,512
Let's hurry!

941
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:59,848
Quiet. Keep your voice down.

942
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:11,151
What are those two doing?
I'll have to leave them behind.

943
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,656
I advise you not to anger me.

944
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:21,161
We'll be alone here for a long time.

945
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,002
They should've escaped.

946
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,509
You think you can fight me?

947
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,372
Robots!

948
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:43,118
Sheeta!

949
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:53,086
Fantastic!

950
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,215
A marvelous display, no?

951
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:01,261
Die, you insects!

952
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:04,932
How dare you!

953
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:10,145
Damn.

954
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:20,489
Be a good girl, give it back.

955
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:24,201
Please, open!

956
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:34,670
Just where will you go?

957
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:38,131
Open!

958
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:58,569
Sheeta!

959
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:15,168
Sheeta!

960
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:18,505
Pazu!

961
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:20,507
Sheeta!

962
01:51:22,009 --> 01:51:23,760
-Pazu!
-Sheeta!

963
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,638
Sheeta!

964
01:51:27,472 --> 01:51:28,891
-Pazu!
-Sheeta!

965
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:31,435
I'm coming. Damn.

966
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:32,477
Get back!

967
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:36,315
Take this, hurry! Muska's coming, quick!

968
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:46,074
Throw it into the sea.

969
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,037
Sheeta!

970
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:56,877
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.

971
01:52:25,906 --> 01:52:28,617
Get up! No more hide and seek.

972
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:38,502
How delightful that it should end
in the throne room.

973
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:39,753
Come here!

974
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:41,880
The throne room?

975
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:44,257
This will be our grave.

976
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,596
What is a king
when his country lies ruined?

977
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,515
I won't give you the stone.

978
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:55,310
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.

979
01:52:56,436 --> 01:53:00,273
This is why Laputa died out.

980
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,026
There's a song in my valley...

981
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,781
<i>Put down your roots in the soil</i>
<i>Live together with the wind</i>

982
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:11,743
<i>Pass the winter with the seeds</i>
<i>Sing in the spring with the birds</i>

983
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:15,038
Your weapons may be powerful.

984
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,166
Your pitiful robots may be numerous.

985
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:20,127
But you can't survive
away from the earth.

986
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,759
Laputa will not die. It will rise again.

987
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:31,054
Its power is the stuff
of humanity's dreams.

988
01:53:33,724 --> 01:53:37,102
Next, I shoot off your ears!

989
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:38,603
Beg for your life.

990
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:41,106
Make the kid hand over the stone.

991
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:43,775
Wait!

992
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:45,736
The stone's hidden.

993
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:48,321
You can shoot, but you won't get it.

994
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:52,993
Stay away, Pazu. He'll kill us both.

995
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,622
I'll spare her life if you tell me
where the stone is.

996
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:02,794
Or do you intend to conquer me
with that cannon of yours?

997
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:06,965
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

998
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:09,718
Run away. Take the stone and run!

999
01:54:11,428 --> 01:54:13,096
Three minutes.

1000
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:30,489
Pazu.

1001
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:37,704
Sheeta, calm down and listen.

1002
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:39,956
Teach me that spell.

1003
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:43,543
I'll say it with you.

1004
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,546
Put your hand in mine.

1005
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,558
I cut the pirates' ropes.

1006
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:05,357
Time's up. What do you say?

1007
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:51,653
My eyes! My eyes!

1008
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:58,577
I can't see...

1009
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:14,301
Mama, it's collapsing!

1010
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,303
All right, let's go. Hurry!

1011
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:17,721
Hurry!

1012
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:31,818
Look, the bottom's falling out!

1013
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:24,829
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

1014
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,791
They used the spell of destruction.

1015
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:31,920
Those kids saved Laputa from those idiots.

1016
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,883
It's stopping!

1017
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:46,393
A crystal! A humongous one!

1018
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,061
It's rising.

1019
01:57:54,568 --> 01:57:58,572
The tree... it's carrying it away.
Chase it!

1020
01:57:58,863 --> 01:58:00,991
You're heavy, get off.

1021
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:02,075
I can't!

1022
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,608
Sheeta!

1023
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:40,113
Pazu...

1024
01:58:45,285 --> 01:58:47,621
The roots protected us.

1025
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:05,388
We can still use this.

1026
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:07,307
Here goes.

1027
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:20,422
What are you doing, we're not moving.

1028
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:23,508
Of course not, we're overloaded.

1029
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:30,640
It's Sheeta!

1030
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:31,558
She's alive!

1031
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:32,517
It's the kid!

1032
02:00:36,938 --> 02:00:37,981
Dola!

1033
02:00:38,523 --> 02:00:39,816
Thank God you're alive!

1034
02:00:40,525 --> 02:00:41,818
You guys okay?

1035
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:46,156
Oh, no! My galleon's wrecked...

1036
02:00:47,407 --> 02:00:50,910
Oh, stop blubbering.
We'll build a better ship!

1037
02:00:51,536 --> 02:00:55,915
You poor child, the worst
is having your hair hacked off...

1038
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,626
-I can't breathe!
-Sorry.

1039
02:01:00,336 --> 02:01:01,337
Pathetic.

1040
02:01:02,213 --> 02:01:04,174
All that work, and only this to show.

1041
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:09,596
We ran out of time!
