1
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:47,245
THE BEGINNING

2
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>Our blue home</i>

3
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:08,516
<i>Where the sea lilies sway</i>

4
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>I was speaking</i>

5
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:25,992
<i>With my countless</i>

6
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:31,998
<i>Brothers and sisters</i>

7
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:38,004
<i>In the language of bubbles</i>

8
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:47,096
<i>Do you remember ?</i>

9
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:55,980
<i>Long, long ago</i>

10
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>You and I were living</i>

11
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:14,707
<i>In the blue sea together</i>

12
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,172
<i>The jellyfish, the sea urchin</i>

13
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>The fish, and the crabs</i>

14
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:33,017
<i>They were all</i>

15
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,896
<i>Your siblings</i>

16
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,957
Sosuke, come right back!

17
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,125
Okay.

18
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,559
A goldfish.

19
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,865
It's stuck.

20
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,676
That was weird.

21
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,396
Ow!

22
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,942
Is it dead?

23
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,031
It licked my finger. It's alive!

24
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,203
Sosuke, we're leaving!

25
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,124
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

26
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,052
This wind feels strange.

27
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,888
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

28
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,274
Did you find her?

29
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,991
What? Captured by a human?

30
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,246
This is bad, very bad.

31
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
Is it dead?

32
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
It's alive!

33
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,506
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

34
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,176
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

35
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,302
A goldfish?

36
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,930
Down by the rocks.

37
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,292
I'm sorry, but you can't use
weed killer here.

38
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,714
Heavens, no! This is pure sea water.

39
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,926
It keeps me humidified.

40
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,095
Just as long as it's not weed killer!

41
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
Good day!

42
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,399
This is very bad.

43
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,070
What a creepy guy.

44
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,449
But don't you say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

45
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,033
I won't.

46
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,161
Are you taking that to school?

47
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:25,828
Yes.

48
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,913
Won't the teacher complain?

49
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,876
It'll be fine. I'll look after her.

50
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,335
She's cute.

51
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,052
They're using the dry dock.

52
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,182
Here, eat this before we get there.

53
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,602
Maybe she's hungry.

54
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,729
Want some?

55
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,316
Hey, my cut is gone!

56
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

57
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,201
She's really special. She can do magic.

58
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,329
Ponyo fixed my cut.

59
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,299
Want some ham?

60
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,234
Lisa, Ponyo likes ham!

61
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,610
That makes two of us.

62
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,677
Oh no!

63
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,014
Disgusting!

64
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,267
Hurry, Lisa!

65
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,486
Such filth! It's intolerable!

66
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,532
Good morning!

67
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,499
Look, Ponyo. There's our house.

68
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,439
I'll drop you here, okay?

69
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,356
Okay.

70
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,859
-Have fun.
-See you!

71
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,945
Morning! Sorry I'm late.

72
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,448
-Could you get Noriko's wheelchair?
-Yeah.

73
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,173
Morning, Sosuke.

74
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,092
I'm busy, Yoshie. Talk to you later.

75
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,427
Oh my!

76
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,720
Hello, Sosuke.

77
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,472
Can't talk now, Toki.

78
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,389
Well, well...

79
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,857
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

80
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,944
I know!

81
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,742
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

82
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,205
What if a cat comes?

83
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,678
Stay here, I'll be right back.

84
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,437
See you later.

85
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,442
It's all right. She'll be just fine.

86
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,278
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

87
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,739
Good morning, teacher.

88
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,116
Hello, Sosuke.

89
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,242
How are you?

90
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,041
-Sosuke!
-Kumiko.

91
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,294
Like my dress? My mommy got it for me.

92
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,589
Let's play, Sosuke.

93
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,758
Not now. I'm busy.

94
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,385
How come?

95
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,303
I told you, I'm busy.

96
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,763
You're no fun.

97
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,098
No fun.

98
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,912
Ponyo!

99
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,504
Sosuke?

100
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,423
Kumiko.

101
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
What's that?

102
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,926
You're not supposed to bring stuff in.

103
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,598
But these trees aren't on school grounds.

104
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,891
Show me!

105
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,435
Oh, a goldfish.

106
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,146
It's not a goldfish. It's Ponyo.

107
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,356
Ponyo? I want to see!

108
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,859
Promise not to tell?

109
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,110
Promise!

110
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,114
There! Cute, isn't she?

111
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:04,041
It looks fat. My goldfish is much cuter.

112
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,859
It was Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

113
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll give you some more water.

114
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,097
Ponyo!

115
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,689
You scared me.

116
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,866
Why, how odd. That was Sosuke's voice.

117
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,538
But he's supposed to be in school.

118
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,790
I must be hearing things.

119
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,876
Here I am, Yoshie.

120
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,964
I knew I heard your voice.

121
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,759
Do I have a secret?

122
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,887
-Yes!
-Bingo!

123
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,140
Okay, what color is my secret?

124
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,644
-Red!
-Red!

125
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,146
Good guess.

126
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,649
How did you know?

127
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,984
Show us.

128
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,152
Okay.

129
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,656
Oh, how pretty.

130
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,200
Very cute.

131
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,701
Her name is Ponyo.

132
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,495
She loves ham, and she can do magic.

133
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,542
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.

134
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,632
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.

135
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,552
Then we could run around just like you.

136
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,723
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.

137
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,017
Can I have a look?

138
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,435
Sure, Toki.

139
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,065
Heavens, it has a face!

140
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,110
Quickly, throw it back in the sea,

141
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,112
otherwise there'll be a tsunami!

142
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,324
You're so superstitious, Toki.

143
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,619
Fish like that bring bad luck.

144
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,704
Everyone knows that!

145
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,835
The tsunami! It's here!

146
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,088
The tsunami's here!

147
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,423
Tsunami!

148
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,762
What's wrong, Toki?

149
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,056
Just look at my clothes.

150
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,440
Sosuke!

151
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,447
Sosuke!

152
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,493
Sosuke!

153
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,080
Sosuke!

154
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,916
Come back here, and apologize to Toki!

155
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,138
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

156
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,391
Sosuke.

157
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,479
Sosuke.

158
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
Ponyo!

159
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,614
Ponyo. Sosuke.

160
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,869
Ponyo... loves... Sosuke!

161
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,335
I love you too.

162
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,379
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

163
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,797
Ponyo!

164
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,509
Ponyo!

165
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,808
Ponyo!

166
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,268
Sosuke!

167
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,897
Ponyo!

168
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,109
Ponyo!

169
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,004
Listen, Sosuke. Maybe it was fate.

170
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,256
You can't change fate.

171
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,593
Ponyo was born in the sea.

172
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,344
She went back home, that's all.

173
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,182
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy's gone.

174
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,726
Give me a lick?

175
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,145
Hurry, it's melting!

176
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,025
Not bad!

177
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,491
Cheer up. Koichi will be home tonight.

178
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,495
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

179
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,024
No more going in the ocean today, okay?

180
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:26,942
Okay.

181
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,552
Sosuke?

182
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,430
Time to come inside.

183
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:02,435
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

184
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,939
There's only one way to find out.

185
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,498
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

186
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,294
Hello?

187
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,129
Yes, it's me.

188
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,046
KOGANEIMARU

189
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,631
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

190
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,134
<i>I can't get back tonight.</i>

191
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,261
<i>I'll signal when I'm offshore.</i>

192
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay. Here's Lisa.

193
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,268
Koichi? Yes. What?

194
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,521
Can't you get out of it?

195
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,983
Fine! Just leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

196
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,235
I give up!

197
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,451
Sosuke, let's go out to eat tonight.

198
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,287
I want to eat at home.

199
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,986
There he is! Turn off the lights, Lisa.

200
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,014
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

201
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,891
Your wife must be upset.

202
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,024
He says he's sorry, Lisa.

203
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,277
I-D-I-O-T.

204
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,073
I-D-I-O-T.

205
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,625
He says he loves you!

206
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,503
Lots and lots!

207
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,635
IDIOT

208
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,227
Wow, that's cool!

209
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,777
HAVE A SAFE JOURNEY

210
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,574
THANK YOU

211
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,577
GOOD NIGHT

212
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,764
Don't cry, Lisa.

213
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,224
I won't cry.

214
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,354
I promised Ponyo
that I'd take care of her.

215
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,612
I hope she isn't crying.

216
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,368
Okay, let's cheer up!

217
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,122
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

218
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
Ow!

219
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,210
Don't worry, Sosuke.

220
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,046
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

221
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,053
Now, let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

222
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,731
This is all my fault.

223
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:21,194
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

224
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,281
How often have I warned you about humans?

225
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,283
Their very breath is polluted.

226
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,286
Come, you must eat.

227
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,622
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

228
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,500
I want ham.

229
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,420
Ham?

230
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,798
What on earth have you been doing?

231
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,550
Answer me, Brunhilde!

232
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,178
My name's not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

233
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,180
Ponyo?

234
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,100
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

235
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,978
I'm going to become human.

236
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,896
Human?

237
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,816
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

238
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,403
They rob the sea of life.

239
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,781
I was human myself... once.

240
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,993
I finally escaped that awful heritage.

241
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,995
I want hands.

242
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,164
I don't like these feet.

243
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,210
I want feet like Sosuke.

244
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,753
Of all the nonsense!

245
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,276
Look at me! Hands and feet!

246
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,194
Look!

247
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,823
-Don't tell me you tasted human blood?
-Look!

248
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,408
I want to see Sosuke!

249
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,454
No! His blood has deranged your DNA!

250
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,540
Revert... Revert...

251
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,715
Go back... Go back!

252
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,804
It's not working. I need more power.

253
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,851
I want to go! I want to go!

254
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,942
I want to go!

255
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,861
Let me out!

256
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,529
Be still, you evil blood.

257
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,951
Revert, revert!

258
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,838
Just like her mother, so strong.

259
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,222
If I hold her like this,
she should be fine.

260
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,413
My powers can only hold her for a while.

261
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,207
Looks like only her mother can do it.

262
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,969
No! My elixir is too strong for you!

263
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,555
Shoo! Go away!

264
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,183
My crab shields are weakening.

265
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,310
It might disrupt the balance of nature.

266
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,770
Calm down, calm down!

267
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,482
I get a bad feeling
every time I have to meet her.

268
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,777
This batch should be ready.

269
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,872
No leaks down here.

270
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,336
This door is loose.

271
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,052
I'll have to fix it later.

272
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,478
I can't let any creatures in,
or there'll be big trouble.

273
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,212
Superb!

274
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,424
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.

275
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,679
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

276
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,225
An explosion of life to match
the Cambrian Era!

277
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,644
This revolting era of Man will be over.

278
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,359
Close up, close up.

279
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,903
Teeth!

280
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,031
Oh my!

281
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,330
I'm going back to Sosuke!

282
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,790
Sosuke!

283
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,859
Captain, look there!

284
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,366
It's a tsunami! Turn her into the waves!

285
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,952
What is that?

286
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,794
Captain, the radio's out, the radar too!

287
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,717
A little girl? She must be Sosuke's age.

288
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,271
Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.

289
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,899
Thanks.

290
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,526
Take care.

291
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,072
Do you want to wait here for Lisa?

292
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,575
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

293
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,827
Goodbye.

294
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,745
Be careful out there.

295
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,000
Sorry, Sosuke. The power's out.

296
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,209
The door wouldn't open, would it?

297
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,420
-Was school okay?
-Yeah.

298
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,965
Go on home, Lisa. We'll be fine.

299
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,216
What about Grandma Kaneko?

300
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,969
She'll be fine, she'll be here soon.

301
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,972
We're spending the night anyway.

302
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,600
You should go while you can.

303
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,936
Wait for me, Sosuke.

304
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,229
Okay.

305
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,200
Yoshie.

306
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,369
Oh, it's you, Sosuke!

307
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,039
I can't see well in the dark.

308
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,166
This is for you.

309
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,755
My, what is it?

310
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,548
One for you, too, Noriko.

311
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,758
Thank you.

312
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,511
I can't see a thing.

313
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,514
Such a heavy storm,
worse with a blackout.

314
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,391
I don't want to spend the night here.

315
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,231
Oh, good, the power's on.

316
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,108
It's a goldfish!

317
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,571
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

318
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,783
<i>...an extremely powerful storm tonight.</i>

319
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,160
<i>Ships should exercise caution...</i>

320
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,288
This TV's useless.

321
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,627
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

322
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,546
You should go home, Sosuke.

323
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,590
Your goldfish will bring us luck.

324
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,842
We're not afraid now.

325
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,094
Okay.

326
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,270
Here's yours, Toki.

327
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,902
It's all wrinkled. What is it?

328
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,237
Like this.

329
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,449
I know! It's a grasshopper.

330
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,368
No, it's a ship.

331
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,788
It's your father's ship, isn't it?

332
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,706
Yes.

333
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,708
Still looks like a grasshopper.

334
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,004
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

335
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,589
Yeah.

336
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,800
Goodbye, everybody.

337
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,635
Goodbye.

338
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,763
Don't let the wind blow you away!

339
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,224
Climb in here.

340
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,772
The phone lines are down too.

341
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,506
The sea's swelling up!

342
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,971
Will the ships sink?

343
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,391
They're safe out at sea.

344
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,934
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

345
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,948
I see fish, Lisa.

346
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,116
Fasten your seat belt!

347
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,871
THE 12TH OHAMA

348
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,421
You've got to turn back, Lisa!

349
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,216
People are going to the shelters.

350
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,637
But there are people
at the old folks home!

351
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,724
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

352
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,936
I've just got to get home.

353
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,814
-No way through here.
-Go around the mountain.

354
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,735
-Here we go, Sosuke.
-Okay.

355
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,823
-No! Stop!
-Look out for that wave!

356
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,205
Here it comes!

357
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,457
Run for it, Lisa!

358
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,166
The fish are following us.

359
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,625
Seat belt, Sosuke!

360
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,016
Hold on tight!

361
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,945
That wave's unstoppable!

362
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,791
-A little girl fell in.
-What?

363
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,334
She was riding a fish.

364
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,590
Where?

365
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,434
The sea keeps rising.

366
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,728
Sosuke, where did you see her?

367
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,731
Out there, running on top of a fish.

368
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:40,816
On a fish?

369
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,738
Come on, Sosuke.

370
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,133
Hang on, Sosuke. We're almost home.

371
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,022
There's a little girl!

372
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,858
It's dangerous! Better come with us!

373
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,777
Stay there, Sosuke.

374
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,138
Sosuke, do you know her?

375
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,786
Ponyo?

376
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,956
Yes, it's me!

377
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,457
It's Ponyo!

378
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,088
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

379
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,685
I'm back!

380
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,331
Now, listen, children.

381
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,668
No matter how strange everything seems,

382
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,212
we have to stay calm.

383
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,213
Okay.

384
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,339
Now, be good.

385
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,596
Take off your raincoat, Sosuke.

386
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,557
Here, Ponyo, you hold the light.

387
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,397
I'll get you something to dry yourself.

388
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,874
In here, Ponyo!

389
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,295
It smells just like you!

390
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:34,966
Ponyo!

391
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,391
Gotcha! Let's get you dried off.

392
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,065
Such pretty red hair.

393
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,194
But your clothes are dry.

394
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,698
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

395
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,204
I like this.

396
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,707
All right, who wants some tea?

397
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,585
Ponyo, help me with the light.

398
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:11,837
Coming!

399
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,339
I wonder if there's any water...

400
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,842
-Sure!
-Sure!

401
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,596
-Water!
-Water!

402
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,600
We have a tank outside.

403
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,187
What about the gas?

404
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,772
Presto!

405
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,483
-All right!
-All right!

406
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,026
It's propane.

407
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,739
Okay, take your seats.

408
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,992
Okay!

409
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,618
Over here, Ponyo.

410
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,126
Sit down, like this.

411
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,922
Put your stuff down.

412
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,051
You need your hands.

413
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,845
I can use my feet!

414
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,141
Wow!

415
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,271
What are you two doing?

416
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,982
Her feet are like hands.

417
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,086
There you go.

418
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,262
This is the best!

419
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,354
That hit the spot.

420
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,316
What shall we do now?

421
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,610
I want ham.

422
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,404
She's crazy about ham.

423
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,241
Then, let's eat.

424
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,411
But first, let's start the generator.

425
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,915
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.

426
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,836
Koichi is my father.

427
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,671
Is he an evil magician?

428
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,672
No, silly.

429
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,966
He's a ship captain.

430
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,593
What about your father, Ponyo?

431
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,972
Fujimoto! He keeps me prisoner.

432
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,100
I ran away.

433
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,228
What about your mother?

434
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,857
I love my mother!

435
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,860
She's really scary.

436
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,111
Sounds like Lisa.

437
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,784
Can you help me, Ponyo?

438
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,845
Maybe the fuel's too old?

439
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,847
Is it clogged up?

440
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,182
Clogged up.

441
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,933
It's clogged up there.

442
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,658
Success!

443
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,577
All bright!

444
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,081
Wow, Ponyo!

445
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,392
Antenna! Antenna!

446
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,270
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

447
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,482
I can't see a single light.

448
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,752
Too loud!

449
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:03,753
What's wrong?

450
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,298
Even the radio's out of whack.

451
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,762
This is JA4-LL, JA4-LL.

452
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,764
<i>Do you read me, Koichi?</i>

453
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,600
<i>Lisa, Sosuke, and Ponyo here.</i>

454
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,477
<i>We're all fine.</i>

455
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,856
We're about to have dinner.

456
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,774
Ham!

457
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,703
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

458
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,304
It's not ready yet.

459
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,264
It takes three minutes.

460
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,031
Close your eyes.

461
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,450
Not yet.

462
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,621
No peeking, Ponyo.

463
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,502
Okay, you can look now.

464
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,963
And... presto!

465
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,847
-Ham!
-Good for you, Ponyo.

466
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,162
Ponyo's fallen asleep.

467
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,005
Ponyo must've come from far away.

468
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,757
I guess so.

469
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,150
Look, Sosuke. The sea's calmer.

470
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,153
Is that because Ponyo's asleep?

471
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,488
Look over there.

472
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,040
It's moving. Someone's up there.

473
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,501
People from the home?

474
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,426
It's gone.

475
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,719
That's the peak road.

476
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,558
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.

477
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,865
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

478
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,746
I'm going to the old folks home.

479
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,830
I'll go with you too.

480
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,083
Stay here with Ponyo.

481
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,670
I'm going too. Let's take Ponyo with us.

482
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,631
I'm going with you!

483
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,803
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse
in the storm.

484
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,308
It brings light and hope
to those in the dark.

485
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,101
So, someone has to stay here.

486
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:52,565
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

487
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:57,362
But right now, I'm worried about
the residents of the old folks home.

488
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:02,116
Just knowing you're here will help me.

489
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,370
Don't worry. I promise to come back.

490
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,456
Promise?

491
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,625
I promise.

492
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,251
You promised!

493
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,879
I love you, Sosuke.

494
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,687
I see the lights of the town!

495
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,232
Finally. Now we can navigate.

496
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,735
I've never seen that town before.

497
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,577
Did the storm blow us to America?

498
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,637
That's not a mountain.

499
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,389
And that's no harbor.

500
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,349
Those are all ships!

501
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,154
Carried by the wave,
gathered as a mountain here.

502
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:08,075
It's a ship graveyard. What's going on?

503
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,041
We've lost power!

504
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,127
Heave to! Drop the sea anchor!

505
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,128
Aye-aye!

506
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,227
Something's coming!

507
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,673
A sea goddess?

508
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,144
-We're moving!
-We're saved!

509
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:20,439
It was her, it was the goddess!

510
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,818
Protect us from harm...

511
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,346
Higher, higher...

512
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,613
A barrier spell.

513
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,198
Where did she learn that?

514
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,261
Good heavens, she's human!

515
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,681
Hey, watch out! What are you doing?

516
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,484
Stop it, you lot! It's unsafe!

517
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,072
Stop that at once!

518
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,832
I'm simply trying to save your sister.

519
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,091
She's here. She answered my call.

520
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,379
Fujimoto.

521
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,506
You came, my beloved.

522
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,050
Such a beautiful sea.

523
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,515
Full of magic.

524
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,309
As if I'm back in the big ocean.

525
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,895
It's Ponyo, she tasted human blood

526
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,399
and plundered all of my elixir.

527
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,737
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

528
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,411
It's all my fault.

529
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,330
She's totally beyond my control.

530
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,499
It's complete chaos.

531
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,252
She doesn't understand what she's done.

532
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:34,008
Now she's human
and run off to a boy's home.

533
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,179
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

534
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:50,399
No! The satellites are falling.

535
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,651
The earth's gravitational field...

536
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,279
Be still.

537
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,665
Sosuke... That's his name, yes?

538
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,964
You love your sister, don't you?

539
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,305
Listen, dear.
What if Ponyo really became human?

540
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,516
Use the old magic.

541
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:28,854
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

542
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:33,609
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!

543
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,613
That's where we all came from, dear.

544
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,075
But he's only five!

545
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,416
Sleep well, little children.

546
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:03,973
Sosuke!

547
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:06,892
Sosuke!

548
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,816
Morning, Ponyo.

549
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,235
Morning, Sosuke.

550
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:25,244
We almost got flooded.

551
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,644
Where's Lisa?

552
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,063
She must be stuck someplace.

553
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,649
If only we had a boat...

554
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,487
There's a boat!

555
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,116
We can't fit on it.

556
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,409
We can!

557
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,593
Awesome!

558
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,723
The candle's bigger too.

559
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,099
We can fit.

560
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,643
This is cool.

561
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,019
Cool!

562
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,229
Grab that end.

563
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,396
Okay.

564
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,025
Ready?

565
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,652
Ready!

566
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,124
She's seaworthy!

567
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,963
Awesome. No leaks!

568
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,715
Now we fill the boiler.

569
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,385
The water goes in here.

570
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,638
It goes in the boiler.

571
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,750
It goes like a rocket!

572
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,926
Everything's shipshape.

573
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,969
Shipshape!

574
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:47,886
Yes, it is.

575
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,389
-Shipshape?
-Shipshape!

576
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,727
Shipshape! Shipshape!

577
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,374
Hot?

578
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,375
Hot!

579
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,673
-It's hot.
-Hot!

580
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,636
The candle's burning.

581
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,596
It's burning!

582
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,932
Hot, hot, hot!

583
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,484
Hot, isn't it?

584
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,246
Awesome!

585
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:01,043
-It's all shipshape, Sosuke!
-Yeah.

586
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,795
-Great, isn't it?
-Yeah.

587
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,513
This is so much fun.

588
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,766
It's burning, isn't it?

589
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,727
It's hot, isn't it?

590
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,232
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

591
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,651
Okay, I'll be the lookout.

592
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:53,971
There's a road.

593
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,181
That's the road Lisa took.

594
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,269
Lisa's not there.

595
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,730
She will be. She gave me her promise.

596
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,364
Ancient fish from the Devonian Age.

597
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,366
There's Bothriolepis.

598
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,082
-And that one is...
-Dipnorhynchus.

599
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,459
Dipnorhynchus!

600
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,044
That one's really huge.

601
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,963
That's Devonynchus.

602
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,506
Devonynchus!

603
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,432
Ahoy!

604
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,729
There's a boat!

605
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,898
Ahoy!

606
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,567
They're calling us.

607
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,904
Ahoy!

608
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,869
Over there!

609
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,540
Pretty good, huh?

610
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,712
Now, Ponyo.

611
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,513
-Hello.
-Hello.

612
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,265
What a wonderful boat.

613
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,310
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

614
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,396
He's not little, he's Sosuke.

615
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,523
This is Ponyo.

616
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,943
I'm Ponyo. I used to be a fish.

617
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,444
A fish?

618
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,447
Ponyo, that's a nice name.

619
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:36,907
Yes.

620
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,910
Have you seen Lisa?

621
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:40,994
Lisa?

622
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,830
She's not with you?

623
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:45,582
She's at the old folks home.

624
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:46,667
The home?

625
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,168
This is my baby.

626
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,201
Oh my, what happened?

627
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,042
Are you giving it to us?

628
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:43,890
Pass the cup.

629
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,355
Thank you.

630
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,524
Let's try it.

631
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,071
It's delicious.

632
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,240
Lisa made it.

633
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,367
It's for the baby!

634
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,873
Oh, I'm sorry. He can't handle soup yet.

635
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:12,377
But this will help me make milk for him.

636
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,882
Lisa gave me her milk too.

637
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,761
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

638
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,512
Sure.

639
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,306
Thank you.

640
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,283
People from the town.

641
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,410
It's like a festival.

642
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:50,290
Ahoy! You there! Do you need assistance?

643
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:55,545
Thanks, we're okay for now!

644
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,882
Then, please follow us!

645
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,677
We're going to the hotel on the peak.

646
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,471
Okay! Will do.

647
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:07,974
The whole town's here.

648
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:10,519
I'm glad everyone's all right.

649
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,354
Careful, Ponyo.

650
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,356
Hold on a second.

651
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,029
Milk!

652
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,031
Oh my...

653
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,534
Milk!

654
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,453
She ate all the ham.

655
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,456
Thanks. This will help me make good milk.

656
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,752
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

657
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,047
Thanks. Ponyo will make it bigger.

658
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,467
-Be careful!
-Thank you!

659
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:49,975
What is it, dear?

660
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,106
Don't cry.

661
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:16,918
Ponyo!

662
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,224
Sosuke!

663
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,267
It's Sosuke!

664
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:33,560
It is!

665
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,811
Where's Lisa?

666
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,605
Isn't she with you?

667
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:39,733
I'm going to pick her up.

668
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:43,487
So she survived that wave?

669
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,490
Sosuke, take me with you!

670
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,576
Later, Kumiko. I'm busy now.

671
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:53,246
Everyone from the home
was evacuated to the park.

672
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:55,665
-Keep safe!
-Good luck!

673
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:59,628
We'll send a boat for them later.

674
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,214
Good luck, Captain!

675
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:53,932
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

676
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,939
Good job we just got a new candle.

677
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,776
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

678
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,158
Bye-bye.

679
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,955
Ponyo, can you make this candle bigger?

680
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,206
All right.

681
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,965
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

682
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,223
Ponyo?

683
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,991
Ponyo?

684
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,176
It's shallow enough to walk.

685
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:21,162
I can see the road.

686
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:35,260
The boat!

687
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:37,971
Ponyo!

688
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,117
Ponyo!

689
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,203
Ponyo, wake up!

690
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,332
Sosuke...

691
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,798
Don't scare me.

692
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,926
I thought you were turning into a fish.

693
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,859
Lisa's car. Ponyo, that's her car!

694
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,574
Lisa!

695
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,829
Lisa!

696
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,466
Here's your boat.

697
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,969
Water's coming out of your eyes.

698
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:49,894
Let's look for Lisa.

699
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:51,437
Yes.

700
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:37,483
THE SUNFLOWER

701
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,486
-You forgot your wrap!
-Who needs it?

702
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,197
Look, it's a whale!

703
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,449
How wonderful!

704
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,327
My knees don't hurt anymore!

705
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,662
What were we so afraid of?

706
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:50,747
Is this the Other Side?

707
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,540
Who cares? It's wonderful.

708
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:58,504
Attention, please! Gather round.

709
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,381
Coming!

710
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,716
Shall we?

711
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,304
It feels great to run.

712
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,639
Meet you there!

713
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:12,685
The winner!

714
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,273
You're so fast, Kayo.

715
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,235
Quiet, everyone!

716
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,363
The moment of truth is at hand.

717
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,366
Sosuke and Ponyo are almost here.

718
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:27,867
Oh my!

719
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,327
Will love triumph?

720
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,745
I'm so excited!

721
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:33,456
How lovely!

722
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:34,916
Quiet!

723
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:37,710
You are all here as witnesses.

724
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,921
Please wait patiently.

725
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:45,760
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not going to do
something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo?

726
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:49,180
Nonsense, he's her father.

727
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,306
Of course not.

728
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,226
If they pass this test...

729
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:54,602
Excuse me.

730
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,780
What a lovely gentleman.

731
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,366
Where's Lisa gone to?

732
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:13,371
She's been talking
with Ponyo's mother for ages.

733
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,215
It must be hard for Lisa.

734
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,426
I wonder what they're talking about.

735
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,762
Let's find out. Lisa!

736
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:32,890
Lisa!

737
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:45,069
We're all rooting for Sosuke and Ponyo!

738
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,084
Lisa!

739
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,502
You must be worried.

740
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,921
Sosuke will be just fine.

741
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,341
He's a strong little boy.

742
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,345
Thanks, everyone. He'll need your support.

743
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,847
Of course!

744
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,481
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

745
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:23,149
SANJO MUNICIPAL PARK

746
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,317
SINGLE LANE
REVERSIBLE LANE

STOP
YIELD

748
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:30,573
STOP

749
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,956
I've been through here before.

750
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,584
Ponyo?

751
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,795
I don't like it.

752
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:49,926
Don't let go of my hand.

753
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,090
Ponyo!

754
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,153
Ponyo!

755
01:30:58,077 --> 01:30:58,911
Ponyo!

756
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:23,186
Ponyo, please don't die!

757
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:24,812
Ponyo!

758
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,566
Wake up, Ponyo!

759
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,194
Shh! Don't wake her up.

760
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,614
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

761
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,825
Lisa and the old ladies are waiting too.

762
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:39,827
Lisa?

763
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:43,456
Won't you come with me, you and Ponyo?

764
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:49,253
Move quietly, let's not wake her.

765
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:50,963
Sosuke!

766
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:54,550
Don't listen to him!

767
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,429
He tricked everyone into going with him.

768
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,432
-Toki...
-But he couldn't fool me!

769
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:05,144
There's no time, I tell you!

770
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,980
Don't you see what's happening?

771
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,442
If the moon comes any closer,
we're finished!

772
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,820
Is that the best you can do?

773
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,782
-Sosuke, come here!
-Jeez!

774
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:21,410
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.

775
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:23,412
Don't make me use force.

776
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:25,915
Ponyo!

777
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,253
Is this how you treat your father?

778
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:38,177
Ponyo!

779
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,180
Run, Sosuke!

780
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,932
You don't understand!

781
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:49,855
You can make it!

782
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,693
Jump!

783
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:34,317
Now what?

784
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:30,539
Lisa!

785
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:31,499
Sousuke.

786
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:32,750
Ponyo!

787
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,465
Look over there.

788
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,384
Where are we?

789
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:53,604
So, you're Sosuke.

790
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:57,316
Hello. Are you Ponyo's mother?

791
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,734
Yes.

792
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:03,239
I want to thank you
for bringing my daughter back to me.

793
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:09,829
Ponyo has broken the magic seal
in order to become a human.

794
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:12,540
To become human,

795
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:17,670
she requires a man
that will understand and accept her.

796
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:22,174
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

797
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:23,884
Yes.

798
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,888
She turned into a mermaid
because she tasted your blood.

799
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,056
That's right!

800
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,685
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.

801
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:34,979
So that's why she's half-fish, half-human.

802
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:39,733
Can you accept her as she is?

803
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:45,030
I'll always love Ponyo,
whether she's a fish, a human,

804
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,365
or in between.

805
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,965
Come, Ponyo.

806
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:22,193
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

807
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:28,699
But to become human,
you first must give up your powers.

808
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,242
Can you do that?

809
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,161
Yes.

810
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,465
Kiss this bubble when you return to land,

811
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:49,053
and Ponyo will transform
into a little five-year-old girl.

812
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:54,058
That's wonderful, Ponyo.

813
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:57,561
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

814
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:07,238
Now the planet is safe again.

815
01:37:10,866 --> 01:37:14,161
Splendid, Sosuke!

816
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,080
Sosuke!

817
01:37:18,832 --> 01:37:20,209
Sosuke!

818
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,151
I'm grateful, Lisa.

819
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:49,238
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

820
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:03,502
Is everyone all right?

821
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:11,051
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

822
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:13,470
Don't bother, we'll walk.

823
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,055
It's all so exciting.

824
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:20,728
I believe this boat is yours.

825
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:24,231
Thanks.

826
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:28,736
I hope you'll forgive me. May I?

827
01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:35,993
Take good care of Ponyo.

828
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,164
That's Koichi's boat.

829
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:46,545
Koichi!

830
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,469
It's Lisa! And there's Sosuke!

831
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,349
Look, Ponyo, it's Koichi's boat.

832
01:39:20,245 --> 01:39:23,916
<i>Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the little fish</i>

833
01:39:23,999 --> 01:39:28,128
<i>Who came from the blue sea</i>

834
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:31,840
<i>Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the girl</i>

835
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:36,095
<i>With a big round tummy</i>

836
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:48,148
<i>Tap tap, jump jump</i>

837
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:52,111
<i>Feet are so nice, watch me run</i>

838
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:56,115
<i>Grip grip, swing swing</i>

839
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:59,743
<i>Hands are so nice, let’s hold each other’s</i>

840
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:04,164
<i>When I skip with her</i>

841
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:08,127
<i>My heart flutters too</i>

842
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,129
<i>Chew, kiss, hug</i>

843
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:12,214
<i>Chew, kiss, hug</i>

844
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:17,553
<i>I love her</i>

845
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:20,222
<i>The little red</i>

846
01:40:20,305 --> 01:40:23,892
<i>Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the little fish</i>

847
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:28,147
<i>Who came from the blue sea</i>

848
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:31,900
<i>Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, the girl</i>

849
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:36,029
<i>With a big round tummy</i>

850
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:48,208
THE END
