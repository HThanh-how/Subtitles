- All right, turn
this side of your head.
- No.

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,765
Oh, look at how dirty
that is.

We're gonna get
a place real soon,
okay?

27
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,063
Now you got to go
to sleep,

28
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:26,769
and you better dream about
that chocolate ice cream
that you had.

- Mama?
- Yeah.

30

- Did you know that?
- No.

36
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,758
He was born
and raised here,

37
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,798
and he swore
he'd never leave.

38
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:03,102
He said that Mississippi
was the place of miracles.

39
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:07,876
You think he'll give us
our miracle?

Please don't disrespect me.

55

Thank you.

56
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,820
Now I'm guessing
you know it's not legal

57
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,225
to go in them trucks
and do them dirty things.

58
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,187
I didn't go
in no truck.

59
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,392
Now I saw you
coming down
off them steps.

60
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:39,791
Ned called us.

61
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,403
All right? He's tired
of y'all trashing up
his parking lot.

62
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,799
See, this here
is a family establishment.

Well, I didn't do
nothin', so...

- Y'all never do.
- What are you doin'-- Hey!

65

I didn't do anything!

- You can't do this.
- Shut your damn mouth!

and you can't leave her
in there, so...

75
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:22,901
- And I'm telling you
the truth.
- Aw shucks.

76
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,843
See, I didn't leave her.
You did.

- [sobbing]
- Oh, stop crying.

78
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,079
Now you're not
going to jail.

79
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,187
And if you were,
I'd have cuffed you
already.

80
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,685
You just sit back
and relax.

81
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,350
And if you're
a good little girl,

82
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,926
if you're quieter
than a little church mouse,

83
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,558
you might even get back
to your kid quicker
than you think.

[distant train horn]

85
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:57,776
Now I know you know
I'm about to come back there.

86
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,043

- [rustling]
- See?

88
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,215
I ain't gonna hurt you.

89
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:11,218
Maybe we could even
be friends.

90
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,095
How about
a little mood lighting?

Good girl.
Now the rest.

98
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:12,653
Now swing them legs
over to me.

99
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,287
There you go.

100
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,766
If you wanna see
that motel room again...

101
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:30,132
you better goddamn behave.

I wouldn't worry about that.
We ain't done just yet.

- You hear me?!
- [gasps]

107
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,903
Take it back off.

108
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,246
I thought that was
what you wanted.

109
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:50,047
Yeah, it was.

110
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:01,025
I did what you
told me to do.

111
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,595
And you said that you would
take me back to my kid.

112
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,129
What do you think
would happen

113
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,031
if that kid's momma
got picked up
for prostitution,

114
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,803
kid left there alone
in that shitty motel room?

115
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,638
There's no food
or nothing in there either.

116
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,470
- Huh?
- [phone line ringing]

117

Hey, old boy.

118
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:22,211
Got us
some new entertainment.

119
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,580
Well, why don't you
come on out
and I'll show you?

120

[Clint laughing]

121
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:30,421
Same spot.
Y'all can both come.

122
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:32,551
[chuckles] Yeah.

123
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,291
Gon' be a party!

124
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,360
We're gonna have us
some company.

125
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,832
You want me to go out
on the hood
and wait for 'em?

126
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,499
Now that's
the spirit!

127
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:49,068
And why not?

128
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,009
Be a nice
hood ornament.

129
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,111
Don't put nothin' on.

Yeah?

Can I get my shirt
to sit on?

138
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:39,552
Go on.

139

Whoa, now.

Are you
fuckin' kidding me?

144
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,248
Don't you know not
to play with guns,
girl, huh?

145
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,819
That ain't a toy.

00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,770
You ain't
out of my reach, boy.

179
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,419
You all right, man?

180
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,520
Jesus.

181
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,802
Home, sweet fucking home.

182
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,575
[soft music playing]

183
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,309
[water splashing]

184
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:37,910
Hey, there,
old man.

185
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,487
[deep sigh]

186
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,522
Heads up
would have been nice.

187
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,062
Told you I was
getting out soon.

188
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,525
Well, I could've
come pick you up.

189
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,998
Nah, I didn't want
to bother you.

190
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,862
Nah, it weren't
no bother.

191
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,738
[chokes up] Ahem.

192
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,867
This here's Consuela.

193
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,910
<i>- Es mi hijo.</i>
<i>- Sí.</i> Same eyes.

194
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,478
- [chuckles]
-<i> Mucho gusto.</i>

195
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:09,975
Nice to meet you.

196
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:13,683
Speaking of eyes,
what happened to your face?

197
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:16,448
Just a little going away
present from the boys
on the inside,

198
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,588
- I suppose.
- Hmm.

199
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,091
I figure he could use
a little meat
on his bones.

200
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:24,728
This woman can cook.

201
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,696
Come on, you look like
you need something to eat.
Come here.

202
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,863
- Jeez, I just walked
all the way over here.
- Oh, hell.

203
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,405
Where'd she
come from?

204
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,638
I went to visit
your uncle Clive
down in Bogalusa.

205
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,710
I saw her working
in a sugar cane field.

206
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,675
Big brown eyes
kept watching me
everywhere I went,

207
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,882
and she kept
laughing at me.

208
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:50,086
Anyway, I figured
I'd go and ask her
why she was laughing.

209
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,656
I mean, you should've seen
how he had them workers livin',
in them ratty shacks,

210
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:57,758
and... she didn't have
nobody and neither did I, so...

211
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,695
I asked her if she wanted
to come and stay with me,

212
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:02,199
and she said yes
and she's been here
ever since.

213
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,233
- And the rest is history.
- Yep.

214
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:06,202
You're speaking
Spanish now.

215
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:08,869
<i>Muy poco</i> ,
but she gets it.

216
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,873
I'll bet she does,
you sly dog.

217
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:15,011
It ain't like that.
You get your mind
out of the gutter.

218
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:16,379
Where she sleep?

219
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,084
Um, in your old room,
in the barn.

220
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:21,952
- You liar.
- Oh, gimme that.

221
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:23,015
[Mitchell chuckles]

222
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,660
[Mitchell sighs]

223
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:43,035
It got awful quiet here
when your mama passed.

224
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,481
Some nights I'd sit
out here and...

225
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,584
it sounded as if the world
had come to an end.

226
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,993
I tried to quit
feeling bad about it.

227
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,721
I hope your mama
understands.

228
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,957
Oh, I can't figure
she'd mind.

229
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,734
You can't feel any worse
about her than I do.

230
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:14,066
I know it hurt her
me being where I was
while she was dying.

231
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:19,808
Well, she loved you.
And that's all that matters.

232
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:29,115
I wrote you a bunch
of letters I didn't send.

233
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:33,458
You know, I figured
you didn't need
the extra weight.

234
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,655
You didn't need more shit,
mine or anyone else's.

235
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:37,727
Well, that's okay.
I'm here now.

236
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:40,426
Give me all the shit
you got.

237
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:41,764
[Mitchell chuckles]

238
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:47,503
[object rattles]

239
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:50,471
You still got
that old thing, huh?

240
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:52,610
You talkin'
about the Bible?

241
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:55,545
She and I sit out here,

242
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,915
helps her
with her English.
She reads.

243
00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:00,652
Just like you and me
used to read when you
was learnin', remember?

244
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,255
- Yeah, I remember.
- You used to love
those old stories.

245
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:04,851
Daniel in the lion's den
was your favorite.

246
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:07,753
I don't really believe
in none of that no more.

247
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,525
What, that the lions
didn't eat him?

248
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:11,860
Nah. I don't believe
in none of it.

249
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,602
I used to go
to these prison chapel
meetings sometimes.

250
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:20,899
An old white-haired preacher,
a bunch of outlaws

251
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,107
sittin' in all
these folding chairs,

252
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,775
yelling their hallelujahs.

253
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,314
Preacher'd get up,
give his sermon.

254
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,781
And everybody get
to take turns,

255
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,351
getting up at the pulpit,
give their testimonies.

256
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,817
"Yes, I stole."
"Yes, I raped."

257
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,588
"Yes, I beat the shit
out of my fellow man."

258
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,456
"But now I found
the love of God,

259
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:44,293
now I see the light."

260
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,793
And so on, and so on,

261
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,127
and all their clappings
and "amens," and shit,

262
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:51,230
and I just didn't care
for it, so I stopped going.

263
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:52,769
Hmm.

264
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,603
Do you think it's fair?

265
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,777
What? Do I think
what's fair?

266
00:23:58,879 --> 00:23:59,777
Tsk...

267
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,411
Well, that man can get
into the magic Kingdom

268
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:05,878
no matter what they done,

269
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,488
as long as they say
the magic words.

270
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:11,756
Words have power
if you mean them.

271
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,994
And it doesn't matter
what you and me think
is fair.

272
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:18,495
This Good Book

273
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:20,962
tells me that the door
is always open.

274
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:23,333
Let me ask you something.

275
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:25,238
How's what you did
different?

276
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,233
'Cause I made
one big fucking mistake!

277
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:30,935
And I didn't mean it.
They meant it.

278
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,806
Damn right.
And you ain't them.

279
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:36,347
You made
a big fucking mistake

280
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,280
and you did
your time for it.

281
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:40,179
Well, in whose eyes?

282
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,689
Mine? Theirs?

283
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:47,788
I have an accident,
I get swooped away

284
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,558
and locked away
behind these bars.

285
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,923
Don't get to show
my remorse,

286
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,992
get my sorrys
to nobody that I hurt.

287
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:56,202
Ain't you, ain't me,
ain't nobody out there

288
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:58,734
just gonna snap
their fingers

289
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:02,135
and instill some sort
of forgiveness in me.

290
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:06,579
Son, you're being
awful damn hard
on yourself.

291
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:13,585
I got to believe
we can be forgiven.

292
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:16,754
'Cause if we can't, well,
then we're all fucked.

293
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:22,322
[Mitchell chuckles]

294
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,992
It was them boys that did
that to your face,
wasn't it?

295
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:28,330
Waitin' at the bus stop,
soon as I pulled in.

296
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:31,202
Yeah, fuckin' Larry.

297
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:34,099
Got you set up
at, uh,

298
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:38,204
one of my places there
at, uh, Michigan Avenue.

299
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:40,175
Here's your car keys,
got the keys to the place--

300
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,545
It's that old place
we put the shutters on,
you remember?

301
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,178
Oh, I know.
How could I forget?

302
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,145
Yeah, but, uh, listen,
why don't you
just stay out here,

303
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,653
you give those fellas
some time to cool off?

304
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,852
Oh, they ain't
coolin' off
any time soon.

305
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:53,351
'Sides, they know
where you live.

306
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:56,959
They can pull up the driveway
just as easy as I can.

307
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,061
I ain't bringin' that
out here.

308
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,637
Well, I've got
something for you.
Hang on to these.

309
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,143
Here. [sighs]

310
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:23,120
I don't recall anything
about no hunting rifle
in the New Testament.

311
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:27,352
Well, you can only turn
so many cheeks,
and I only got four, so...

312
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:31,762
I'd be breaking
about two dozen laws
just by having it.

313
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:33,560
I'd feel a whole lot better
knowing you're safe.

314
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:37,230
- Ain't gon' be that bad.
- Well, you don't know
how it's gonna get.

315
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:42,873
Okay.

lifting me up like that.

346
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:33,671
- Oh, I got you.
- [Boyd laughs]

347
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:35,633
Well, talk to me.
How was it?

348
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:39,945
About what you can imagine,
'cept way fucking worse.

349
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:44,848
How's Lacey? She still
turning backflips?

350
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,444
God no! She couldn't put
her right leg

351
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,748
in that old cheerleader
outfit if she wanted to.

352
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,184
[both laugh]

353
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:52,386
You gotta love her,
though, man. You got to.

354
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,486
So what's goin' on here?

355
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:58,563
[Boyd] Ain't no point
in keeping it a secret.

356
00:30:58,665 --> 00:30:59,962
Be on the news
tomorrow.

357
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,094
One of our own shot
with his own pistol,

358
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:03,701
which we can't seem
to find.

359
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,535
- Shit.
- [distant train horn]

360
00:31:06,637 --> 00:31:07,905
Anyone I know?

361
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,738
Nah, this guy came down
from Tupelo or somewhere

362
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,143
a year or two back.

363
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,643
Been on thin ice
ever since he got here.

364
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:18,180
So I wouldn't be surprised
if something ain't catch
back up to his ass.

365
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:20,478
Just hate for Lacey
to find out about this one.

366
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,254
She stays worried enough
about me, you know?

367
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,550
Oh, I bet.

368
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:27,925
Well, they're gonna ask me
if I checked you out, so...

369
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:30,056
I gotta check you out,
see what's in the truck.

370
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,492
Okay, yeah.
Open it up.

371
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:45,143
Russ, you ain't been out
24 hours.

372
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:48,207
Shit, man! You know
you ain't supposed
to have no gun.

373
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,980
Just got out
of the damn cage, Boyd.

374
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:52,444
You don't know
what that feels like.

375
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,653
- You wanna go back
to the cage?
- No.

376
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:56,150
Didn't think so,
so if I was you,

377
00:31:56,252 --> 00:31:58,056
get in the truck
and call it a night.

378
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:02,357
Yes, officer.

379
00:32:06,865 --> 00:32:10,101
[suspenseful music playing]

380
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,375
[Brenda]<i> This is it.</i>

381
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,209
You have the whole place
to yourselves.

382
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,611
The doors lock
at 8 p.m.

383
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:29,286
If you go out,
you need a password
to get in.

384
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,285
Oh, hey, you wait.
You let me help you
get up there.

385
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:33,853
Well, let me help
put your bags away.

386
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:36,424
No. We're good.

387
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:39,326
Is, uh...

388
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:40,964
Is there anything
I can do for-for work?

389
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,359
I mean, I'll do
just about anything.

390
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,400
There's a bar
up the road

391
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:46,799
where you can help
with the dishes
and work in the kitchen.

392
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:50,702
Now, it ain't much,
but he pays out
at the end of the day.

393
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:55,010
Can I work today?

394
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:56,677
You look
like you need a break.

395
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:58,347
I don't.

396
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,551
You sure nobody's
following you?

397
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,484
We get that.

398
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,754
Didn't you tell her
that she could have
a hot dog?

399
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:09,820
Hmm?

400
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,131
- You want a hot dog?
- Come on, baby.

401
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,347
[somber music playing]

402
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,686
[birds chirping]

403
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:01,275
Sometimes I have a hard time
remembering how old he'd be.

404
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:04,549
I ride by here
just to remind myself.

405
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:05,849
You ever do that?

406
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:08,247
I could say
at anytime...

407
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:11,383
exactly how old
he'd be.

408
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,692
Twenty-five years,
three months.

409
00:34:13,794 --> 00:34:16,194
Yeah, I wish
I could do that.

410
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:19,491
It's all right.

411
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:23,668
You got a busy life,
you got a family.

412
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,401
Ain't nobody blamin' you.

413
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:31,572
Besides...
I remember enough
for the both of us.

414
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:42,083
Why do you always
do that?

415
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:46,224
His toll.
To bring him home.

416
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,558
There's always
a price to pay.

417
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,340
I like that.

418
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:10,140
[laughing]

419
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:13,719
Man, it's no wonder
these boys are stacked
like brick houses,

420
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:14,786
you feedin' them like that.

421
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:16,080
Well, they're hearty eaters.

422
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,420
Boys...

423
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:20,823
Well, I thank you
much, Lacey.

424
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:21,826
That was damn good.

425
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:23,555
We're just glad
you're home.

426
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:25,957
I'm just glad these boys
took after you.

427
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,828
- [laughs] Your mouth
to God's ears.
- [Boyd] Hey, now.

428
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,803
Oh, I see
you're up to mischief.

429
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:36,238
[glasses clink]

430
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,206
- 'Bout that time?
- [dishes rattling]

431
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,677
Don't act
like you don't know.

432
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:41,906
[Boyd sighs]

433
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,927
Why the hell
you didn't call me
knowing you was getting out?

434
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,367
Hmm?

435
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,930
You know I would've drove
down there and got you.

436
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,707
You know it don't work
like that.

437
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,809
Tsk, see, uh...

438
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,371
that's where you're wrong.

439
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,142
I got special privileges.

440
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:17,780
Flash 'em the old badge.

441
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:20,352
[both laughing]

442
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:22,721
- Special privileges.
- Well, I'll just
show 'em mine.

443
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:24,121
That didn't work
anyways.

444
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,483
- And it's bigger.
- [Boyd laughing]

445
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:28,527
Always has been,
always will be.

446
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:31,155
[chuckling]

447
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:32,693
All fools.

448
00:36:35,165 --> 00:36:37,665
Tsk. Larry had it figured.

449
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:41,506
That's what happened
to your face?

450
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:42,703
Sure is.

451
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,374
How serious do you think
the brothers are?

452
00:36:45,477 --> 00:36:48,411
Oh, I don't know
how serious they are
together.

453
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:50,876
I know Larry's
pretty serious
all on his own.

454
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:53,745
You want me to go
say something?

455
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:55,552
- 'Cause you know I will.
- No. Shit, no.

456
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:57,818
I've dealt with way worse
since the last time
I saw you.

457
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,822
Besides, Larry's
just a puppy dog,
comparatively speaking.

458
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:04,323
Yeah, an aggravating,
chew-up-your-shit
puppy dog, though.

459
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,590
There's a big difference.

460
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,300
[grunts]
Well, you know...

461
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:13,868
How you doin'?
You doin' okay?

462
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:15,604
Doing good.

463
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:19,910
Russ, come on.

464
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:21,577
How you really doin'?

465
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,512
Thought I'd feel
a little different.

466
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:28,686
Feels good
all at the same time, but...

467
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,953
I don't know.

468
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:32,423
You seen her yet?

469
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:34,722
No, not yet.

470
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,689
But it's a small town,

471
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,929
I'm bound to run into her
sooner or later.

472
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:42,293
[chuckles] Man...

473
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:47,067
We burned up a lot of miles
and a lot of time
out on those roads.

474
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,472
I missed that.

475
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,339
Turns out,
I missed you too, bro.

476
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:55,875
Oh, don't get
all gushy on me.

477
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,016
I missed you too,
bud.

478
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:02,849
I knew it.
I knew it.

You look the same.

- [laughs] Please.
- You do.

492
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,693
Well... you look like
you could use a hot meal.

493
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:59,793
You know, people
keep saying that to me,

to buy me any dinner.

Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm all right.

I bet your daddy's happy
that you're home.

502

I was sorry
about your mama.

503
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,261
Yeah...

504
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,804
[sniffles] Yeah, boy.

505
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:44,939
Sure would've been nice
for her to see me make it.

506
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,582
I bet she's smiling.

Hurricane last night.

[laughing] I bet.

510
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,458
That hurricane
got a name?

511
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,062
Oh, they usually do.

You still mad
at me?

514
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:23,879
I told you then
like I'll tell you now.

515
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:27,586
Ain't nothing
to be mad about.

516
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,218
Seems like you told me
the same thing.

517

I just wondered.

519
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:45,637
I'm the one that told you
to stop coming to see me.

520
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:49,839
But I'm the one
who agreed.

521
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:00,982
How many kids?

522
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:05,252
I got twin boys
and a little girl.

523
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:06,790
How old?

524
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:12,631
My boys are four
and the girl is two.

525
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,403
Man, all I want to do
is hold your hand right now.

526
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,648
Just for one minute.

527
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,955
[melancholy music playing]

528
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,354
[Sarah sniffles]

529
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:49,965
[kisses]

530
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,740
[Sarah sobbing]

531
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:24,769
There's a whole lot
between us now.

532
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,104
[sighs] A whole lot...

533
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,783
I can't keep it
anymore.

534
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,050
But it's yours.

535
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:45,350
It was.

536
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:49,019
[sniffles]
I gotta go.

537
00:44:49,121 --> 00:44:52,357
[melancholic music continues]

538
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,438

00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:28,129
[soft music playing]

540
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:38,843
[Maben] Hello.

541
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,173
- Mommy!
- [laughs]

542
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:45,509
Hi, baby. Thank you
for watching her.

543
00:45:46,884 --> 00:45:48,881
- What are you doing?
- Coloring.

544
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,783
Red? Too scary.
Too scary.

545
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:52,489
- Purple!
- Yeah!

546
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:55,492
Purple, a really
nice light...

547
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:58,561
- shade of purple.
- Yeah.

548
00:45:58,663 --> 00:46:00,359
[Analee]<i> Tell me about Daddy.</i>

549
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,067
Well...

550
00:46:06,537 --> 00:46:07,767
<i>You have his eyes.</i>

551
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:10,502
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

552
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:16,373
<i>And he would've been</i>
<i>able to make you</i>
<i>laugh so hard</i>

553
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:19,876
<i>that I think</i>
<i>you would've broken ribs.</i>

554
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,545
[Maben chuckles]

555
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:25,384
<i>And he was just...</i>

556
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,827
so real.

557
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,357
And so kind.

558
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:35,394
<i>And he was my first everything.</i>

559
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:40,531
And together
we made you.

560
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,734
And you're...

561
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:48,275
the most important thing
in the whole world,
do you know that?

562
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:52,543
Hmm?

563
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:02,025
[soft music playing]

564
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:08,792
- Analee... Analee,
where's our stuff?
- Yeah?

565
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:10,462
In there?

566
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:14,903
Who told you
to empty the bag?

567
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:17,337
I-I-I didn't do it.
The lady did.

568
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,307
[gasps]

569
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:24,081
- Get on your shoes.
- [stammering] What for?

570
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:27,583
Do what I say
and put your shoes on
and get your stuff.

571
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:29,016
But I don't wanna go!

572
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:31,855
Baby, shh! I know
you wanna stay here,

573
00:47:31,957 --> 00:47:34,388
- but we gotta go.
- W-what's happening?

574
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,124
Just listen to me.
Do what I say
and put your shoes on.

575
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:38,756
And get the rest
of your stuff over there.

576
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:40,963
- You said we could
stop walking...
- I know what I said.

577
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:43,594
- ...once we got
to Mississippi--
- Hey! Baby!

578
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,432
Look at me. I love you.
I'm gonna take care of you,

579
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:48,767
but you gotta do
what I'm telling you
to do right now.

580
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,601
Do you get it?

581
00:47:52,274 --> 00:47:54,209
- Mommy, where are we going?
- [shushes]

582
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:57,410
I want my crayons.

583
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,512
- Mommy!
- Shh!

584
00:48:06,626 --> 00:48:08,223
[whispering]
Okay, this way.

585
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:13,426
Okay. Now you have
to be so quiet.

586
00:48:14,631 --> 00:48:16,029
No talking.

587
00:48:16,131 --> 00:48:17,801
We're playing
the silent game

588
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:20,235
- and you wanna win, right?
- Yeah.

589
00:48:25,137 --> 00:48:27,407
I want my crayons.

590
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:32,412
- You're gonna lose
if you say anything.
- [quietly] Okay.

591
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:39,985
[Brenda on phone]
I don't know...

592
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,454
[Analee sneezes loudly]

593
00:48:42,355 --> 00:48:45,128
I found it
unpacking their clothes.

594
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:50,628
I get the feeling
they're in some kind
of trouble.

595
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:54,771
[breathing heavily] Okay.

596
00:48:54,873 --> 00:48:57,437
Okay, listen to me,
baby girl.

597
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:01,206
Mommy messed up,
okay?

598
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:04,947
I messed up really bad.
Big mistake.

599
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:07,818
But you wanna stay
with Mommy, right?

600
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,315
'Cause I really want
to stay with you

601
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,490
and, if we're gonna
stay together,

602
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:15,018
we have to go right now.

603
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,990
And you have to do exactly
what I'm about to tell you
to do, okay?

604
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:20,427
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

605
00:49:22,966 --> 00:49:25,201
[suspenseful music playing]

606
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:34,243
[Analee whispering]
Can we go yet?

607
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:36,674
[Maben] Okay.

608
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:41,184
Okay. Go. Go!

609
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:26,724
[phone ringing]

610
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:32,400
[Brenda] Hello?

611
00:50:34,102 --> 00:50:36,536
Wait. Where's Analee?

612
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:40,144
She's not in the room?

613
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,543
Is the mother back?

614
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:53,149
[distant clattering]

615
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,159
[door opens]

616
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,228
Hello?

617
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:03,827
Analee, is that you,
honey?

618
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,369
Is anyone there?

619
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,868
[dramatic music playing]

620
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,676
[grunting, panting]

621

[lighter clicks]

622
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,593
- [Maben] Don't move.
- [gun clicks]

623
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,366
Get in the truck.

624
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:14,068
Will you get
in the truck?

625
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,099
- All right?
- I'm goin'.

626
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:17,637
Hurry up.

627
00:52:38,128 --> 00:52:40,258
Okay, just turn on
the car.

628
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,493
Turn on the car
and drive!

629
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:44,629
- [engine turns over]
- Where?

630
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:49,001
Just-just go.
Get a-- Get away
from the lights.

631
00:52:49,103 --> 00:52:50,670
North, go North.

632
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:56,407
- Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

633
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,909
I gotta pee
really badly.

634
00:53:00,746 --> 00:53:03,014
Okay, how bad
do you have to pee?

635
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:07,122
- Really badly.
Can we stop, please?
- We'll find her a place.

636
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:09,524
I got a place
for you to pee.

637
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,896
And you can lower
that pistol as well.

638
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:15,330
Lot of potholes out here,

639
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:16,993
don't need you
accidentally shooting me.

640
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:19,663
Didn't come this far
to have it read
on my tombstone

641
00:53:19,765 --> 00:53:21,998
"Accidentally shot
by some woman."

642
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,004
If I shoot you,
it's not an accident.

643
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:34,014
Tsk. Understood.

644
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:36,753
[vehicle pulls over]

645
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:38,322
[sets parking brake]

646
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:43,089
You hurry up. Okay?
Go pee fast--

647
00:53:43,191 --> 00:53:46,062
Hey!
No. No!

648
00:53:46,164 --> 00:53:47,426
Fucking give that
back to me.

649
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:49,927
Oh, I think
I'll hold on to that.

650
00:53:51,132 --> 00:53:52,699
[gun clicking]

651
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:00,311
This ain't your gun.

652
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:05,578
Can you just
give me back that gun?

653
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,681
You can empty it out,
I don't care, just--

654
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,021
- Just give it back to me.
- I will...

655
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,684
when you tell me
who it belongs to.

656
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:16,019
- [Maben sighs]
- [rain pattering]

657
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,862
I tried to fix all this...

658
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:28,906
before it even started.

659
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:31,034
You know,
I went down...

660
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:35,277
to this place in New Orleans
when I found out
I was pregnant.

661
00:54:35,379 --> 00:54:37,612
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

662
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:40,681
Maybe it was.

663
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:47,083
But as I--

664
00:54:48,658 --> 00:54:51,429
As I was sittin' there,
in that room, waiting,

665
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:53,724
and I don't know,
I just started thinking
that, you know,

666
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:56,763
maybe everything
was going to be okay.

667
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:01,372
[voice breaking] I've tried
so fucking hard...

668
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:06,410
You know, I actually
didn't even know a person
could, uh...

669
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,679
could try that hard.

670
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:15,512
[sniffs] But you know, uh...
[sniffs] nowhere worked out.

671
00:55:15,614 --> 00:55:18,089
Not Shreveport, not...

672
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:21,755
not Beaumont,
not Lake Charles, and...

673
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,695
I can't feed her.

674
00:55:29,763 --> 00:55:32,403
[weeping] I can't put
clothes on her.

675
00:55:33,737 --> 00:55:37,502
I can't give her
a fucking place to sleep
and now this.

676
00:55:37,604 --> 00:55:40,209
So yeah... [sniffles] Uh...

677
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:44,780
If you could just
leave us here...

678
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,477
Please...

679
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,683
And what about
your family?

680
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:53,655
What about her daddy?
What about your mama?

681
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:58,025
[smacks lips]
Not everybody
has somebody.

682
00:55:58,127 --> 00:56:00,156
[rain pattering]

683
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:08,703
So where to now?

684
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,140
[stammers]

685
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:13,837
I'll make you a promise.

686
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:18,610
I'll drive you anywhere,
within reason.

687
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:21,815
But we're gonna
take a rest tonight.

688
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:23,883
Okay?

689
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,795
[Maben]<i> I knew</i>
<i>it wasn't gonna end.</i>

690
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:40,202
<i>All I could see</i>
<i>was her face.</i>

691
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:41,869
Thinking that I'd left her,

692
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:45,201
thinking that nobody
in the whole world
cared about her.

693
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:51,744
So I stole his gun
and I shot him.

694
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:54,144
I shot him
until he wasn't movin'
no more.

695
00:57:03,362 --> 00:57:05,595
But you don't look
like a killer to me.

696
00:57:07,698 --> 00:57:10,798
I've seen plenty,
I know what they look like.

697
00:57:13,169 --> 00:57:14,731
[fire crackling]

698
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,573
[cigarette rustling in box]

699
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:26,616
Why are you holdin' on
to that gun, anyway?

700
00:57:28,013 --> 00:57:30,246
You know that damn thing
gon' bury you.

701
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,021
If there's one thing
in the world
that could bury you...

702
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,025
would you wanna know
where it was?

703
00:57:43,398 --> 00:57:45,030
What's your name?

704
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:57,977
- [insects chirping]
- [soft music playing]

705
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,851
[grunting softly]

706
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,053
Got her?

707
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:11,991
You guys just sleep in here.
I'll take the back.

708
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:20,934
Maben.

709
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,270
My name's Maben.

710
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,178
I'm Russell.

711
00:58:59,142 --> 00:59:00,875
Maben...

712
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,277
You gotta be kiddin' me.

713
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:15,087
Cody?

714
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:19,322
Cody, boy.

715
00:59:21,464 --> 00:59:25,163
Big papa's home.
Big--

716
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:27,566
Hey. Hey, I--

717
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,135
Look, I know
that it's--

718
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:31,708
- You're not supposed
to be here.
- [stammering] I-I know.

719
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,771
- I know, I know.
- Go on, Larry.
Go on. Come on.

720
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:36,842
Look, look,
is-is he here?

721
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:40,146
- Is Cody here?
- 'Course he's here.

722
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:42,819
- Could I-could I see him
for a minute?
- Oh, Larry.

723
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,355
- It's the middle of the night.
- Baby, baby, please, please.

724
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,719
No, it's the middle
of the night.

725
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:48,351
I just wanna see him
for a minute.

726
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,229
[sighs]

727
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:54,027
I see you've been drinking.

728
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:59,263
Yeah. Yeah,
I've been drinking.

729
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,711
I just got
one question, okay?

730
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:12,881
Is-is-is he still
playing Little League?

731
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:18,083
- [sighs]
- Is he still playing?
Is he-is he--

732
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:20,954
Is he swinging the bat
like his Daddy showed him?

733
01:00:21,056 --> 01:00:24,653
[sobbing] He's too big
for Little League, Larry!

734
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:26,022
Goddammit!

735
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:28,531
You'd know that
if you saw him.

736
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,694
Well, fuck!
You won't let me see him.

737
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:33,670
That ain't fuckin' fair!
What are you talking about,
"if I saw him"?

738
01:00:33,772 --> 01:00:35,638
I've been tryin' to see him,
that's why I'm here!

739
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,434
Get sober
and you can see
your son.

740
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:41,103
- That's what I said.
- [yelling] I'm fuckin' trying!

741
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,944
- Not hard enough!
- Cody, boy!

742
01:00:43,046 --> 01:00:46,308
You fuckin' be quiet!
We got a restraining order.

743
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:48,582
I don't wanna have to call
somebody, please.

744
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:49,880
Who the fuck
you gonna call?

745
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:51,886
Huh?
You fuckin' call 'em!

746
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:53,616
I remember
that restraining order.
Fuck you!

747
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:56,123
- Call! You call!
- I will fuckin' call
somebody out here.

748
01:00:56,225 --> 01:00:59,257
I will call
somebody out here.
You get out! Get out!

749
01:01:00,896 --> 01:01:02,492
- You hear that, boy?
- [door opens]

750
01:01:02,594 --> 01:01:06,737
- Your Daddy's out here,
trying to see you!
- [door closes]

751
01:01:08,773 --> 01:01:11,874
Don't ever fuckin' say
I didn't try, boy!

752
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,510
[sniffles] Don't ever say
I didn't fuckin--

753
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:19,849
[somber music playing]

754
01:01:29,594 --> 01:01:31,820
- [distant howling]
- [sniffs]

755
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:35,865
[loud howling]

756
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:42,498
[howling continues]

757
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:48,539
- [birds chirping]
- Baby girl.

758
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:51,743
[kisses]

759
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:54,582
[both speaking indistinct]

760
01:01:54,684 --> 01:01:58,514
- Time to wake up.
- Okay.

761
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:03,389
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah.

762
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:04,993
Yeah?

763
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,061
I have a present for you.

764
01:02:10,163 --> 01:02:12,132
- You do?
- Yeah, I forgot about it

765
01:02:12,234 --> 01:02:16,136
until I was lookin'
at you while you were asleep.

766
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,078
Crayons?

767
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:26,076
- In all
of your favorite colors.
- Thank you, mama.

768
01:02:26,178 --> 01:02:28,280
- Thank you, mama.
- [chuckles]

769
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:37,693
- [grunts]
- All right, who wants
to get out of here

770
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,028
and go get a bite to eat
for breakfast?

771
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:42,393
I got us a plan.

772
01:02:43,862 --> 01:02:45,060
What's the plan?

773
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:47,563
I know a place you can go.

774
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,808
Somewhere safe.

775
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:55,241
If I'm gonna trust you,
you're gonna have
to trust me.

776
01:02:57,248 --> 01:02:58,442
Okay?

777
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:02,484
We're gonna get
a little bite to eat, huh?

778
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:05,281
Oh, we'll fill that belly.

779
01:03:05,383 --> 01:03:07,257
- [truck door opens]
- Sleep all right?

780
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,518
[truck door closes]

781
01:03:10,962 --> 01:03:13,630
- [Boyd]<i> G'morning, Mr. Gaines.</i>
- [Mitchell]<i> Boyd!</i>

782
01:03:13,732 --> 01:03:15,330
<i>You happen to see Russell</i>
<i>this morning?</i>

783
01:03:15,432 --> 01:03:16,927
Uh, not yet.

784
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:18,329
Any idea where he is?

785
01:03:18,431 --> 01:03:20,602
No, I was looking for 'im.
You went by the house?

786
01:03:20,704 --> 01:03:23,165
I did, I did,
saw the windows.

787
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,337
Is that what this is about?

788
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:30,814
After we found our man,
Russell came drivin' up.

789
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,310
Just him, nobody else
all night, way out there,

790
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:35,544
so... I gotta ask him
about it, that's all.

791
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,622
Maybe he mighta seen
something that we're not?

792
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:41,086
- That's it?
- That's it, I swear.

793
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,358
I'm sorry to hear
about your man.

794
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,226
Thank you. Yeah.

795
01:03:45,328 --> 01:03:47,892
Well, I just need his eyes.
Just have him call me, please?

796
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:49,094
I will. Oh, and Boyd.

797
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:51,532
Um, keep an eye
on them boys, will you?

798
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:53,069
Especially Larry.

799
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:55,299
I can guarantee it was him
that busted out them windows.

800
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:57,740
They already put a knot
on the side of his head

801
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,470
when they met him
at the bus station.

802
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:03,213
I'll pay attention.

803
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,212
Thanks, Boyd.

804
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:09,084
[insects chirping]

805
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,223
[Russell] You girls
sit tight here.

806
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:21,998
Got some company.

807
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:28,731
Oh, it's good to see
you're still breathing.

808
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,502
You gotta remember
there's people
give a shit about you.

809
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:35,409
What the hell
is going on?

810
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:38,046
I mean, the place
was all busted up,
I assume you didn't do it.

811
01:04:38,148 --> 01:04:41,579
I ain't worried
about none of that
right now.

812
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:45,085
I'm gonna ask you a question,
all I need is a yes or no.

813
01:04:45,188 --> 01:04:48,724
I need that old place
in the barn for them.

814
01:04:48,826 --> 01:04:50,491
I'll explain
everything later.

815
01:04:50,593 --> 01:04:52,958
Boyd was snooping around,
I mean, something
you ain't tellin' me.

816
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,393
Yes or no,
that's all I need.

817
01:04:54,495 --> 01:04:56,259
Oh, yeah, there's something
you ain't telling me.

818
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:58,166
All right, well,
I got your back.

819
01:04:58,268 --> 01:05:01,202
But you got-- you know,
don't keep me
in the dark here.

820
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:05,940
I want you to pretend

821
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:08,573
it's that first time
you saw Consuela...

822
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:12,576
and you did what you did
because you thought
it was right.

823
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:16,583
- [exhales sharply]
- They look hungry.

824
01:05:16,685 --> 01:05:18,183
I make food.

825
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:21,024
Very kind of you,
Consuela. Thank you.

826
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,055
One more thing.
Don't tell anyone
they're here.

827
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:25,391
Well, I'm not
a complete idiot.

828
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:29,725
[barn doors rumbling]

829
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:38,605
- [Maben] It's pretty big.
- Well...

830
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:40,142
Here it is.

831
01:05:41,677 --> 01:05:43,376
Go on in.

832
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,685
Bet you probably expected
something to go moo
when you came in then.

833
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:54,156
[Maben chuckles]

834
01:06:05,102 --> 01:06:07,664
Hopefully this is
comfortable for y'all.

835
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,466
Bathroom is
right over there.

836
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:14,077
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

837
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:17,076
It's nice.

838
01:06:17,178 --> 01:06:20,315
I'll get you
maybe some water.

839
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,278
Hey!

840
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,614
I know your mama
probably said...

841
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:27,220
there's no jumping
on the bed.

842
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:29,385
Well, if there's one bed
in this whole world

843
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,325
that you can jump off,
it's...

844
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,427
it's this one.

845
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:37,362
You jump on that
with everything
your life's got to give.

846
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:41,329
- [Analee] Okay.
- I don't hear you jumping.

847
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:44,338
[Analee giggles]
Thank you!

848
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:49,178
- [pensive music playing]
- [bird cawing]

849
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:53,743
[Mitchell] All right,
slow and steady.

850
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:58,217
- Okay!
- Look, mama!
I caught another one.

851
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,750
Look at that!
Call it beginner's luck!

852
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:04,020
Could've used
this kid as bait!

853
01:07:04,122 --> 01:07:05,524
[Analee laughs]

854
01:07:07,263 --> 01:07:08,861
You gonna catch
another one
out here?

855
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,595
We're working on it.

856
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,096
- [Analee] Trying to.
- What's even out there, huh?

857
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:15,105
[Analee] Catfish.

858
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:19,373
[Russell]<i> Hey, Mama.</i>

859
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:22,112
<i>I'm home.</i>

860
01:07:25,482 --> 01:07:29,685
<i>I'm doing somethin' right now</i>
<i>that I think is right.</i>

861
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:31,352
<i>I'm helpin' someone.</i>

862
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:36,423
<i>I know you're watching over me.</i>

863
01:07:37,863 --> 01:07:40,427
<i>I'll try and do right by you.</i>

864
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:45,564
Anyways, I just wanted
to say I love you.

865
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:51,108
I love you more than anything.

866
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,137
[cheers and applause]

867
01:07:54,906 --> 01:07:59,679
There he is! There's my boy!
You swing, motherfucker!

868
01:07:59,782 --> 01:08:01,016
Swing it!

869
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,412
Swing at those fuckin'
fastballs, Cody!

870
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,480
How many times
I done told you?

871
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,422
How many times
I done told you?

872
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:11,094
- Huh? You swing--
- Hey! What are you
doing here?

873
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:15,231
- Hey! How you doin', Dana?
- You can't be here.

874
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,462
- I can be-- I can watch
my fuckin' boy--
- No, you can't!

875
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:19,060
- You can't be here...
- Shut the fuck up!

876
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,469
- ...and you know it!
- Get the fuck--
I ain't gonna fuckin'--

877
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:23,734
- I ain't gonna fuckin'
hurt nobody!
- Don't do this here!

878
01:08:23,836 --> 01:08:27,040
- [crying] Please, Larry!
- Hey, get over here, boy.

879
01:08:27,142 --> 01:08:29,544
Hey! You get over here, boy.

880
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:32,376
- You don't need
to talk to him, Cody!
- Shut the fuck up!

881
01:08:32,478 --> 01:08:34,978
You shut up!
Don't talk to him, Cody!

882
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,746
What you doin' out there,
boy? You swing
at those fastballs.

883
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:39,618
- You don't take 'em.
- I'm tryin' to play.

884
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,918
Look, I'll come down here.
I'll show you how to play.

885
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,789
- I'll show you how to play.
- I don't need your help.

886
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,566
That's not
what it looks like, boy.

887
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,068
Hey... hey!

888
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,738
- Hey!
- [Cody] I ain't
talkin' to you!

889
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,372
You ain't talkin' to me?

890
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,737
You ain't talkin' to me?!

891
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,643
You ain't talkin' to me?!
You ain't talkin' to me?!

892
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:05,113
Huh?

893
01:09:05,215 --> 01:09:07,844
I'm your goddamn father,
motherfucker!

894
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,618
What kind of boy don't talk
to his own goddamn father?!

895
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,523
What kind of fuckin' boy don't--
what, motherfucker?

896
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,989
- What? Sit the fuck down!
- [people clamoring]

897
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:23,959
- [siren wailing]
- You ugly-ass,
sorry-ass motherfuckers.

898
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:29,465
- Oh, you gon' done
called them again?
- [Dana] Yeah, I did.

899
01:09:29,567 --> 01:09:32,474
You stay right the fuck there.

900
01:09:32,576 --> 01:09:34,675
- What, you think I was gon'
hit you with this?
- [gasps]

901
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:37,208
- You think I was gon'
hit you with this?
- I fuckin' know it.

902
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,941
- Larry!
- Fuck you, Jay.

903
01:09:39,043 --> 01:09:41,043
Fuck you, Jay.
You don't need
to come down here--

904
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,282
- Come on,
think about that...
- Come on, come on...

905
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:46,619
- [grunting]
- Dammit, Larry!

906
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,792
I'm your goddamn father!

907
01:09:51,894 --> 01:09:54,193
You're my boy!

908
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:56,398
Don't fuckin' listen
to her.

909
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,968
- She'll ruin
your fuckin' life, son!
- Come on, enough!

910
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,304
She'll ruin
your fuckin' life!

911
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,769
[insects chirping]

912
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,610
[Maben] What are we
doing here?

913
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:19,751
Try not to look at me
when I tell you this.

914
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:30,025
I was
in an argument one night
'bout my relationship.

915
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:36,273
<i>Done some wrongs,</i>
<i>beat myself up</i>
<i>pretty bad over it.</i>

916
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:41,272
<i>Driving around on back roads,</i>

917
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:42,712
<i>started drinkin'...</i>

918
01:10:42,814 --> 01:10:43,806
[tires screeching]

919
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,477
<i>Drinkin' a lot,</i>
<i>feelin' pretty good...</i>

920
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:49,418
<i>Just drivin' the night away.</i>

921
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:55,017
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I get turned around.</i>

922
01:10:56,522 --> 01:10:58,625
<i>Got lost on the way and...</i>

923
01:11:00,195 --> 01:11:02,596
started going pretty fast.

924
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:10,065
All of a sudden,
I come up over this hill.

925
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,071
There was a truck
right in the middle
of the road,

926
01:11:14,174 --> 01:11:15,609
lights off.

927
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,945
[melancholic music playing]

928
01:11:40,737 --> 01:11:42,031
Hi.

929
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:46,301
[breathes deeply, shudders]

930
01:11:46,404 --> 01:11:47,905
I'm cold.

931
01:11:49,245 --> 01:11:50,677
Let me get you
my jacket.

932
01:11:57,254 --> 01:12:00,951
- [vehicle approaching]
- Hey! Hey!

933
01:12:02,358 --> 01:12:03,789
- Jason!
- [brakes screeching]

934
01:12:05,056 --> 01:12:07,562
I couldn't slam
on the brakes
fast enough.

935
01:12:08,998 --> 01:12:12,729
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>my whole left side's</i>
<i>all crushed up...</i>

936
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:15,066
- Jason!
-<i> ...someone's screaming...</i>

937
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:16,736
Jason!

938
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:19,134
[screaming]
Help! Please help me!

939
01:12:19,236 --> 01:12:22,005
[Russell]<i> And that's</i>
<i>when I left that truck...</i>

940
01:12:22,107 --> 01:12:25,811
-<i> poor soul that was inside.</i>
- [Maben screaming]

941
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:35,491
Had a feeling you might know
what I'm talking about here.

942
01:12:37,993 --> 01:12:38,956
[gasps]

943
01:12:42,627 --> 01:12:44,093
Thought you were in jail.

944
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:48,834
Got out a few days ago.

945
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,846
[catches breath]

946
01:13:02,117 --> 01:13:03,915
I hated you.

947
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:11,494
Oh, my God, I hated you.
I hated you so fuckin' much.

948
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,829
I used to pray
every night...

949
01:13:17,763 --> 01:13:20,903
that somebody
was beatin' you,

950
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:22,736
holdin' you down...

951
01:13:24,636 --> 01:13:27,576
I used to pray for hours.

952
01:13:29,247 --> 01:13:31,709
And one day,
I just got tired of it.

953
01:13:31,811 --> 01:13:33,879
I got tired of it,
I got tired of...

954
01:13:36,518 --> 01:13:39,150
Got too tired
to hate you...

955
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:40,820
anymore.

956
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:48,359
But then, I was
a long way from here...

957
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:50,198
running on fumes.

958
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:54,867
Trying to save
my own life...

959
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:59,135
save Analee's...

960
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:03,372
And you...

961
01:14:03,474 --> 01:14:04,910
you...

962
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:08,177
didn't matter.

963
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,147
At all.

964
01:14:12,651 --> 01:14:14,887
How old is Analee, Maben?

965
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:18,660
How old
do you think she is?

966
01:14:20,465 --> 01:14:22,830
Maben, I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

967
01:14:22,932 --> 01:14:26,866
I swear to God,
I've been praying
that wasn't the case.

968
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:34,907
Larry and Walt know?
They know about her?

969
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:39,043
Don't see
how they would.

970
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:43,011
[sighs]

971
01:14:43,113 --> 01:14:46,755
- Goddamn, I'm sorry.
- No, don't...

972
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:51,687
I didn't get to tell you then,
so I'm sayin' it now that I'm--

973
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:54,256
- I'm sorry.
- No!

974
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:56,694
- I'm sayin' I'm sorry--
- No, you don't get
to apologize

975
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:58,328
'cause it don't change
nothing.

976
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,864
It might make you feel
better, but it don't
change nothing.

977
01:15:00,966 --> 01:15:02,402
It don't make me feel
any better--

978
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:05,069
Do not fuckin'
say it again!

979
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,946
We gotta throw this.

980
01:15:15,048 --> 01:15:18,054
You think
you can pay for that
with a splash?

981
01:15:18,156 --> 01:15:20,315
I already paid for it.

982
01:15:21,888 --> 01:15:23,954
The only person I owe
is that boy

983
01:15:24,056 --> 01:15:26,629
and I'll be paying
for that soon enough.

984
01:15:28,796 --> 01:15:31,994
Shit, I believe
everything you say.

985
01:15:32,096 --> 01:15:34,666
And I'm glad
you shot that asshole.

986
01:15:34,768 --> 01:15:37,340
I don't know
who he was, but...

987
01:15:37,442 --> 01:15:39,968
I can see him in my mind.
Shit, I...

988
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,003
Been many times
I wished I had a gun

989
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:44,677
to shoot whoever
had a hold on me.

990
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:47,344
Been many times
God heard your prayers

991
01:15:47,447 --> 01:15:48,816
and He...

992
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:53,221
He damn sure answered to you,
be sure He's up there.

993
01:15:53,323 --> 01:15:55,224
He heard me that time.

994
01:15:55,326 --> 01:15:57,759
[sniffs]
Not no other time.

995
01:15:58,822 --> 01:16:00,729
Let me ask you...

996
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,228
Why weren't you
in the truck?

997
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:16,277
[sighs]

998
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:19,616
[dramatic music playing]

999
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,757
I guess so...

1000
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,894
so we can be
standing here...

1001
01:16:35,528 --> 01:16:37,095
right now.

1002
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:44,267
Well, I'll tell you
one thing...

1003
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:49,004
They're gonna have to kill me
before I go back to prison.

1004
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:51,414
I know
you already killed once

1005
01:16:51,516 --> 01:16:53,342
when the world
had you by the throat...

1006
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:57,984
I'll do the same damn thing
before I go back.

1007
01:16:59,552 --> 01:17:01,119
You hear me?

1008
01:17:03,326 --> 01:17:05,354
Wait, um... wait.

1009
01:17:09,529 --> 01:17:10,964
I'll do it.

1010
01:17:15,568 --> 01:17:17,135
Wipe it down.

1011
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:27,211
[sniffs]

1012
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:41,731
[exhales sharply]

1013
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,549
What are you
doing here, bud?

1014
01:18:04,651 --> 01:18:07,119
You know me.
Waitin'.

1015
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:10,859
- Where you been?
- Out at Mitchell's.

1016
01:18:12,091 --> 01:18:13,859
Tell you
I came out there
lookin' for you?

1017
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:17,461
- Well... found me.
- I have now.

1018
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:21,164
You know I've been huntin'
for you for a couple
of days, right?

1019
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:24,373
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

1020
01:18:24,475 --> 01:18:26,241
We got
a dead cop, Russ.

1021
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:29,308
Between you and me,
you're the only person
to be seen anywhere near him.

1022
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:31,840
Now, that don't mean nothing
other than we need
to talk to you,

1023
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:34,879
but then when I come
lookin' for you, it takes me
two days to find you.

1024
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:37,348
- So what?
- So where you been at?

1025
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,255
Comin' over here
early in the morning,
late at night.

1026
01:18:40,357 --> 01:18:41,853
Mitchell don't know.

1027
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:43,654
You need to stop
going out there.

1028
01:18:43,756 --> 01:18:45,924
Then tell me what's going on,
because your name
is not the only name

1029
01:18:46,026 --> 01:18:48,163
that's been comin'
across my desk.

1030
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,359
[paper rustling]

1031
01:18:50,366 --> 01:18:51,460
What's that?

1032
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:54,466
You don't remember Maben?

1033
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:56,506
Why should I?

1034
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,773
Because it's the name
of that gal

1035
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:00,538
that was with Jason
the night that he died.

1036
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,913
Figured a name like that
tied to a night like that,
it might stick.

1037
01:19:04,015 --> 01:19:06,541
I tried to forget all that.
Why are you showing me this?

1038
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:13,988
A woman named Maben came
into the shelter downtown
with a little girl.

1039
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,425
The lady working there said
she found a pistol on her

1040
01:19:16,527 --> 01:19:17,922
before she took off running.

1041
01:19:18,024 --> 01:19:19,356
Now I know the last name
is made up,

1042
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:22,832
but it's really hard
to make up a name like Maben.

1043
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:25,535
Tell me
where you've been at.

1044
01:19:25,637 --> 01:19:27,864
Look, you probably
just missed me.

1045
01:19:27,966 --> 01:19:30,138
Been out at Mitchell's.

1046
01:19:30,241 --> 01:19:33,207
Larry's come by here,
busted out all my goddamn
windows and doors,

1047
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:36,340
I ain't just gonna sit
around here waitin'
for his ass to show up.

1048
01:19:40,184 --> 01:19:41,276
Okay.

1049
01:19:41,378 --> 01:19:43,216
You don't mind if I ask
Mitchell, do you?

1050
01:19:43,318 --> 01:19:45,754
I just wanna clear your name,
so the department lays off me.

1051
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:48,184
Of course, go ahead.
Just call 'im first.

1052
01:19:48,286 --> 01:19:50,856
Don't just go
showing up out there.

1053
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,123
Feel like enough burden
as it is.

1054
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:55,027
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.

1055
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,993
You know I hate
asking you these things,
right?

1056
01:19:57,096 --> 01:19:59,330
Yeah, whatever
you say, bud.

1057
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:02,102
Love you.

1058
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:05,837
I'll pay you back
for that bail.

1059
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:07,807
That's what you said
last time.

1060
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:10,374
- Hey, come here.
- What? What?!

1061
01:20:11,608 --> 01:20:15,380
- Dude, what happened, man?
- It don't matter.

1062
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:18,580
- No, it... it does.
- What's the matter,
motherfucker?

1063
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,254
I'm worried about you.

1064
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:27,025
Look, it's j--
it's just us, man.

1065
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:29,360
We're all that's left,
do you hear me?

1066
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,167
It don't--
It ain't gon'
bring him back.

1067
01:20:33,269 --> 01:20:36,037
You gotta let him go, Larry.
It ain't gonna bring him back.

1068
01:20:36,139 --> 01:20:38,066
You fuckin' one of them now.
You're one of them now.

1069
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:40,509
Don't say that shit, man.

1070
01:20:40,612 --> 01:20:41,909
- Fuck you, man.
- Come on, man.

1071
01:20:42,012 --> 01:20:43,672
- [kicks truck]
- Don't say that shit, dude.

1072
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:46,341
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Hey, you gotta calm down!

1073
01:20:46,443 --> 01:20:48,450
You never had my back,
motherfucker!

1074
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,183
Get the fuck out of here!

1075
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:52,317
Come on, man!

1076
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:55,250
- Pussy-ass motherfucker.
- Get back over here, man.

1077
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:58,657
Talk to me!
I'm your brother!

1078
01:20:58,759 --> 01:21:00,160
Fuckin' all there is

1079
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:03,665
- is out here,
talkin' to myself.
- [truck departs]

1080
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:06,166
Just out here,
talkin' to myself.

1081
01:21:13,071 --> 01:21:16,308
[pensive music playing]

1082
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:22,248
Cody on first...

1083
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,347
Jason on second,
Walt's on third.

1084
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:29,887
What's he do--
he's callin' it!

1085
01:21:29,989 --> 01:21:31,653
He's callin' it, y'all.

1086
01:21:32,957 --> 01:21:34,059
Swings...

1087
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:36,827
- Fly fuckin' ball!
- [bat clatters]

1088
01:21:36,929 --> 01:21:39,131
It's out of here!

1089
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:43,031
He's callin' it, playing
to the fuckin' crowd.

1090
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:46,067
[breathing heavily]

1091
01:21:46,169 --> 01:21:48,076
He's making his way.

1092
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,707
[continues indistinct]

1093
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:02,818
He's making...

1094
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,719
[grunts]

1095
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:10,560
[sobbing]

1096
01:22:17,002 --> 01:22:20,240
[music continues]

1097
01:22:21,072 --> 01:22:23,309
[indistinct chatter]

1098
01:22:34,052 --> 01:22:36,289
[insects chirping]

1099
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:40,755
[Analee speaking indistinct]

1100
01:23:07,255 --> 01:23:09,487
[Russell and Mitchell
speaking indistinct]

1101
01:23:12,595 --> 01:23:13,288
[laughing]

1102
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,626
[muted dialogue throughout]

1103
01:23:57,101 --> 01:23:58,536
[knocking]

1104
01:24:10,653 --> 01:24:11,785
[laughter]

1105
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:15,124
[tense music playing]

1106
01:24:38,747 --> 01:24:40,479
[floor creaks]

1107
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:50,885
[footsteps coming up the stairs]

1108
01:24:56,661 --> 01:24:58,365
- Hey!<i> ¿Qué pasó?</i>
- Oh, shit, lady!

1109
01:24:58,467 --> 01:25:00,200
- I was just looking
for Mitchell.
-<i> Párele.</i>

1110
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:01,937
-<i> Usted no puede estar acá.</i>
- Okay. Relax.

1111
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:03,302
- Relax!
-<i> Váyase. Fuera de acá ya.</i>

1112
01:25:03,404 --> 01:25:05,240
Settle down, okay?
Settle down,
I'm leaving.

1113
01:25:05,342 --> 01:25:09,141
-<i> Voy a llamar a la policía.</i>
- I am the damn police.

1114
01:25:09,243 --> 01:25:10,373
[Mitchell]
How you doin', Boyd?

1115
01:25:10,475 --> 01:25:12,047
I mean, I wasn't
plannin' on sellin',

1116
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,546
but, uh, feel free
to have a look around.

1117
01:25:14,648 --> 01:25:16,780
Knocked
on the front door first.
Didn't hear anything.

1118
01:25:16,882 --> 01:25:18,947
Thought I heard you out back,
so I went looking for you.

1119
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:22,987
Well, you were
on the ball, Deputy.
Everything all right?

1120
01:25:23,089 --> 01:25:24,524
I just need to know

1121
01:25:24,626 --> 01:25:26,289
if Russell stayed here
with you the night
before last.

1122
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:27,990
- Yeah, he did.
- All night?

1123
01:25:28,093 --> 01:25:30,966
Well, I didn't set up
all night watching him
snore or nothing,

1124
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,727
but, uh, as far as I know,
he was here.

1125
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:34,903
Okay, good. Anyone else
can attest to that?

1126
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,934
Well, um,
you musta seen 'im.

1127
01:25:37,036 --> 01:25:38,707
Yes, I can.

1128
01:25:38,809 --> 01:25:41,669
You speak English. Okay.

1129
01:25:41,771 --> 01:25:44,180
Yeah, she'll do that...
sometimes.

1130
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:47,876
All right.
Thank you.

1131
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,884
Have a nice day,
Deputy.

1132
01:25:51,986 --> 01:25:53,552
[engine turns over]

1133
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,200
[car approaching]

1134
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:09,568
- [car door opens, closes]
- [whispering] Shit.

1135
01:26:18,379 --> 01:26:20,342
You're lyin' to me
about where you've been.

1136
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:21,576
Your whole family is!

1137
01:26:21,678 --> 01:26:23,615
What I can't
understand is why.

1138
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,849
It don't matter what I say.
You got some big idea.

1139
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:31,257
Call it a big idea,
call it whatever you want.

1140
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:33,621
I'm here so you can talk
to me, man. Me!

1141
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:35,062
Without talking
to nobody else,

1142
01:26:35,164 --> 01:26:36,657
but you're not making it
easy on me.

1143
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:38,199
Now when I get
to that office,

1144
01:26:38,302 --> 01:26:39,763
I'm gonna tell
about not being able
to find you

1145
01:26:39,865 --> 01:26:42,170
and about this woman
named Maben, who has
a pistol on her,

1146
01:26:42,272 --> 01:26:43,668
because you're leaving me
no damn choice.

1147
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,567
Just because
you didn't see me
lay down in bed

1148
01:26:45,669 --> 01:26:47,001
don't mean
I didn't sleep in it.

1149
01:26:47,103 --> 01:26:49,340
Russell, there's ways
of getting to whatever it is

1150
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:50,974
you seem to be
dancing around, man.

1151
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:52,044
Talk to me!

1152
01:26:52,146 --> 01:26:53,711
Then put the cuffs on me.

1153
01:26:54,512 --> 01:26:55,812
Or get the hell out of here.

1154
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,487
Not until you answer me
like I want.

1155
01:27:02,693 --> 01:27:03,919
All right.

1156
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,962
You don't wanna leave?
I will.

1157
01:27:09,064 --> 01:27:10,827
[chair drags across floor]

1158
01:27:12,497 --> 01:27:15,436
Wanna arrest me?
Arrest me.

1159
01:27:19,473 --> 01:27:21,706
Get the hell out
of my damn house.

1160
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:27,448
[soft music playing]

1161
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:34,087
Where's Mitchell?

1162
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,288
Yeah, you and me
got to talk.

1163
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:36,891
Boyd was back here
snoopin' around--

1164
01:27:36,993 --> 01:27:38,226
He see Maben or Analee?

1165
01:27:38,329 --> 01:27:41,594
- [Consuela] Very close.
- What did you call her?

1166
01:27:43,228 --> 01:27:44,993
You heard me.

1167
01:27:51,537 --> 01:27:53,802
[Russell]
<i>You're gonna have to go.</i>

1168
01:27:53,905 --> 01:27:55,905
We're not talking
about forever here, Maben.

1169
01:27:56,007 --> 01:27:58,776
- We're talking about
a couple of weeks, okay?
- Yeah.

1170
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:03,950
Yeah. [sniffs]

1171
01:28:04,052 --> 01:28:05,282
Just a-- [sniffs]

1172
01:28:05,384 --> 01:28:06,748
Just a couple of weeks.

1173
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,083
Hey, I don't see
any other way around it.

1174
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:13,791
Been livin' that way
for a while.

1175
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:29,807
We'll just sit out here.

1176
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:33,107
Let the sun go down.

1177
01:28:34,578 --> 01:28:36,344
I bought you a bus ticket.

1178
01:28:36,446 --> 01:28:39,187
[casings tinkle]

1179
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:41,656
There's one heading out
late tonight.

1180
01:28:41,758 --> 01:28:45,086
It'll take you to Memphis,
you just get off
wherever you feel.

1181
01:28:45,188 --> 01:28:48,458
I got you money too,
it's just all over
at the house.

1182
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:51,393
No. I don't need
your money.

1183
01:28:51,495 --> 01:28:53,468
I know you don't.

1184
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,498
I don't need you
to give me nothin'.

1185
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,902
I know I don't have to.

1186
01:29:00,241 --> 01:29:02,477
Seems like you and I...

1187
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,477
we're tied together
by some sort
of invisible rope,

1188
01:29:07,579 --> 01:29:09,478
and it's always been there.

1189
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,816
It ain't lettin' us go.

1190
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,821
That girl's gonna be
damn fine sittin' here.

1191
01:29:18,924 --> 01:29:20,957
You gotta get out of here,
you gotta be safe.

1192
01:29:21,059 --> 01:29:24,965
You gotta be safe for you,
you gotta be safe for her.

1193
01:29:25,067 --> 01:29:26,632
And I promise you

1194
01:29:26,734 --> 01:29:29,669
I ain't gonna let
a damn thing happen to her.

1195
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:34,476
- I promise you.
- [sniffles]

1196
01:29:35,472 --> 01:29:37,710
I promise you.

1197

[inhales deeply]

1200
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:02,031
Just a little bruise.

1201
01:30:19,055 --> 01:30:21,217
[breathing heavily]

1202
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:22,452
Pull it.

1203
01:30:22,554 --> 01:30:25,155
Come on, motherfucker.

1204
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:26,990
[weeping]

1205
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,229
[breathing heavily]

1206
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:42,236
[exhales sharply]

1207
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:47,615
You fuckin' pussy.

1208
01:30:52,922 --> 01:30:54,182
Ah...

1209
01:30:57,224 --> 01:30:58,956
It's gonna hurt.

1210
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,026
It's gonna fuckin' hurt.

1211
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,204
[Mitchell] We'll take
good care of her,
don't you worry.

1212
01:31:11,306 --> 01:31:13,506
You wanna wake up Analee,

1213
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:16,006
say goodbye to her
before we take off?

1214
01:31:20,045 --> 01:31:22,414
[crying] I fuckin' told her
I'd never leave her

1215
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:24,278
and here I go,
leaving her.

1216
01:31:26,919 --> 01:31:28,917
Every single fuckin' thing
I've done wrong,

1217
01:31:29,019 --> 01:31:32,055
I've brought down
on that little girl.

1218
01:31:32,157 --> 01:31:35,029
Hey, life's a whirlwind.
We're all caught up in it.

1219
01:31:35,131 --> 01:31:36,357
You're a good mama.

1220
01:31:36,459 --> 01:31:38,926
Hell, anyone can see how much
you love that little girl,

1221
01:31:39,028 --> 01:31:40,702
you love her so bad,
it hurts.

1222
01:31:40,804 --> 01:31:43,365
And if it didn't hurt,
you wouldn't be
doing it right.

1223
01:31:43,468 --> 01:31:46,542
That hurt never goes away,
it doesn't matter
how old they get.

1224
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:51,844
Just do the best you can
for right now,

1225
01:31:51,946 --> 01:31:54,308
and you don't worry
about tomorrow
until it comes.

1226
01:31:58,949 --> 01:32:00,589
You're doing
the right thing.

1227
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:04,186
[sighs]

1228
01:32:07,727 --> 01:32:10,060
- Take care of her.
- Oh, yeah.

1229
01:32:12,233 --> 01:32:13,363
[Mitchell] Ahem.

1230
01:32:13,465 --> 01:32:15,230
[Maben sobs]

[light switch clicks]

1237
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:34,276
Coast's clear.

1238
01:33:35,716 --> 01:33:37,351
I've got everything
ready here.

1239
01:33:37,453 --> 01:33:39,451
Got you a bunch of supplies.

1240
01:33:39,553 --> 01:33:41,320
Can I use your bathroom?

1241
01:33:41,422 --> 01:33:42,922
Sure, down the hall.

1242
01:33:45,188 --> 01:33:46,959
- [Larry yells]
- [crowbar lands]

1243
01:33:48,361 --> 01:33:49,326

1246
01:34:02,909 --> 01:34:05,478

1247
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:09,017
[grunting and groaning continue]

1248
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:10,347

[grunting]

1250
01:34:19,555 --> 01:34:23,792
You killed the wrong one.
You ain't fucking perfect.

1251
01:34:23,894 --> 01:34:26,163
You should've killed me.

1252
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:32,004
[Russell breathing heavily]

1253
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:35,711
It's over now, boy.

1254
01:34:37,345 --> 01:34:38,714
[Russell groans]

1255
01:34:43,418 --> 01:34:46,249
[breathing heavily]

1256
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:49,419
I've been waitin'

- [Larry groaning]
- You okay, son?

1261
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:01,364
Dammit, Larry,
I'm sorry.

1262
01:35:01,466 --> 01:35:03,830
Why don't you sit down, son?
I'll call you an ambulance.

1263
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,235
[Larry groaning]

1265
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,214
[Russell] Maben!

1266
01:35:15,316 --> 01:35:17,481
Maben!

01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:20,248
Goddammit, Mitchell!

1269
01:35:20,351 --> 01:35:22,051
I told you to stay
the hell out of this shit.

1270
01:35:22,153 --> 01:35:24,052
- [tires screech]
- You can damn me later.

1271
01:35:24,154 --> 01:35:25,992
We gotta get her
the hell outta here.

1272
01:35:27,292 --> 01:35:29,798
[Mitchell]
Damn, I knew
he'd do something wrong.

1273
01:35:32,862 --> 01:35:34,099
Careful there.

1274
01:35:35,634 --> 01:35:37,172
Be safe, son.

1275
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:38,366
[Russell] Get home!

1276
01:35:38,468 --> 01:35:40,803

of that fuckin' gun!

Come here, boy.

01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,825
- Where is my son?
- What happened to you?

1287

1296
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:55,047

1304
01:37:23,206 --> 01:37:24,405
Dad, stop!
Where are you going?

1305
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:27,341
You can't drive like that,
Larry! Come on!

Somebody help us!

- [nurse] What happened?
- She-- she fell. She...

1314
01:37:54,008 --> 01:37:55,738
hit her head.
Her head flipped back.

Hell yeah,
shots fired.

1323

What the hell happened?

1324
01:38:54,871 --> 01:38:58,505
Walked in my place,
Larry was there.

1325
01:38:58,607 --> 01:38:59,833
Had a woman with me,

1326
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:02,939
he hit her over the head
with a crowbar thinkin'
it was me.

1327
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:04,174
Him and I got into it,

1328
01:39:04,276 --> 01:39:07,345
I got ahold of my rifle
and I shot 'im.

1329
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:10,282
Who is she, Russ?

1330
01:39:11,987 --> 01:39:14,385
You know goddamn well
who she is.

1331
01:39:20,025 --> 01:39:22,259
Russ, you gotta tell me.

1332
01:39:22,361 --> 01:39:24,863
What the hell you got
to do with all this?

[woman over P.A. indistinct]

1334
01:39:28,398 --> 01:39:30,633
I'll explain
everything to you.

1335
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:34,568
You gotta promise me
you ain't gonna listen to me
like a lawman.

1336
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:36,306
What do you want me
to listen to you like?

1337
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:38,607
I want you to listen to me
like you're you...

1338
01:39:40,076 --> 01:39:41,511
and I'm me.

1339
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,354
Okay. Okay.

1340
01:39:53,256 --> 01:39:55,492
[indistinct radio chatter]

1341
01:39:59,029 --> 01:40:01,801
[Russell]<i> The pistol</i>
<i>you're looking for</i>
<i>is over in the lake.</i>

1342
01:40:01,903 --> 01:40:03,567
<i>Same one Maben held on me</i>

1343
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:06,735
<i>when I walked out</i>
<i>of the Armadillo</i>
<i>a few nights ago.</i>

1344
01:40:06,837 --> 01:40:10,804
<i>That's when she got to talkin'</i>
<i>about how some deputy</i>

1345
01:40:10,906 --> 01:40:13,981
<i>made her do everything</i>
<i>that he wanted her to do,</i>

1346

Next thing she knew,
he was down, dead,
and she kept on runnin',

1349
01:40:20,782 --> 01:40:23,223
kept on runnin' straight
until she ran into me.

1350
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:27,524
Why the hell didn't you
and her just both
come straight to me?

1351
01:40:29,397 --> 01:40:32,331
Nobody would've believed her
and you know it, Boyd.

1352
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:36,732
She'da lost the kid.

1353
01:40:36,834 --> 01:40:40,273
And I'll be goddamned,
but I believe
everything she says.

1354
01:40:42,475 --> 01:40:44,207
My road's the road
that brought us all here,

I don't know.

1356

But here we are,
and I ain't lettin' this go.

1357
01:40:49,548 --> 01:40:51,479
Shit, I'm only telling you
all this so you know

1358
01:40:51,581 --> 01:40:53,888
when I ask you
just leave her alone.

1359
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:55,849
I ain't tellin' you,
I'm askin' you.

1360
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:00,293
Just let it fall.

Yes, I do.

01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,472
And do you know what the boys
at Parchman would do
to a sheriff's deputy?

Huh? It'd make your time
