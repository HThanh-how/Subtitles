1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,012
Another village destroyed.

2
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,315
Let's go. Soon this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay.

3
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,703
1,000 YEARS AFTER THE COLLAPSE
OF INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION,

4
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,248
A FOREST EXUDING TOXIC VAPORS,
CALLED THE SEA OF DECAY,

5
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,792
COVERED AN EARTH
STREWN WITH RUSTING RUINS,

6
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,293
THREATENING HUMAN SURVIVAL.

7
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,140
An Ohm's tracks.

8
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,399
They're still fresh.

9
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,959
An Ohm's shell.

10
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,264
Amazing.

11
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,392
I've never seen a perfect shell.

12
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,070
Lovely sound.

13
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,829
It chipped my ceramic sword.

14
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,706
The villagers will be pleased.

15
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,960
They'll have plenty
to make into tools now.

16
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,342
What an eye.

17
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,261
I wonder if I can carry it.

18
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,834
It came free.

19
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,671
It's incredibly light.

20
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,770
Mushigo Palm spores.

21
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,039
So beautiful...

22
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,127
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

23
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,462
in five minutes without a mask.

24
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,817
Who is that?

25
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,911
What can it be?

26
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,290
My heart's pounding.

27
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,586
Those are gunshots.

28
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,254
An insect is attacking someone.

29
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,929
Oh, I'm sorry!

30
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,738
Over there!

31
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,324
What a thick spore cloud.

32
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,787
An Ohm! That must have been its shell.

33
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,668
Don't run that way.

34
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,593
Look this way!

35
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,682
They answered! They're coming.

36
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,008
Who's that?

37
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,778
What a magnificent Ohm.

38
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,911
-Go upwind!
-Thank you!

39
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,666
Return to the forest, Ohm.

40
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,044
This is not your world.

41
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,296
Be a good boy.

42
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,635
It's blinded by rage.
I've got to calm him.

43
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,834
The flares stunned it.

44
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,712
An insect charm.

45
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,265
Awaken, Ohm. Return to the forest.

46
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,152
It's awake.

47
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,799
The Ohm's returning to the forest.

48
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,803
She tamed that Ohm
with flares and an insect charm.

49
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,013
Lord Yupa!

50
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,602
Nausicaä. I hardly recognized you.

51
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,021
It's been a year and half.
Father will be glad.

52
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,190
I must thank you.

53
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
You've become a great wind-rider.

54
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,944
Oh no, not according to Father.

55
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,533
Oh, of course.
I'd completely forgotten about him.

56
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,789
A fox-squirrel. I've never seen one.

57
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,793
When a winged insect snatched him,
I took him for a human child.

58
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,879
I had to fire my gun.

59
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,589
That's what enraged the Ohm.

60
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,343
He'd fainted, so was spared the poison.

61
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,055
Better not touch him.
Even young, they're savage.

62
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,223
Come.

63
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,599
Here.

64
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,768
Hey...

65
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,104
You're not scared.

66
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,107
You're not scared.

67
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,154
See... you're not scared.

68
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,075
See...

69
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,794
You were just frightened.

70
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,343
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

71
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,345
Why certainly.

72
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,973
Thank you.

73
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,392
Kai and Kui. Remember me?

74
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,562
A mysterious power.

75
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,732
You must be tired. You ran so far.

76
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,488
Is everyone well?

77
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,284
What's wrong?

78
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,661
My father...

79
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,290
He can no longer fly.

80
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,749
Jihl...

81
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,169
The forest poisons?

82
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,963
Yes.

83
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,674
He says it's the fate of those
living by the Sea of Decay.

84
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,553
I should have come sooner.

85
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,014
Oh no.

86
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,559
Thank you for coming.

87
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,813
Lord Yupa,
there's something I want to show you.

88
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,899
My secret room.

89
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,235
It's a secret. I don't want to scare them.

90
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,195
I'll tell them you're coming.

91
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,489
Come soon!

92
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,159
Lord Yupa.

93
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,621
Would you carry this?

94
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,956
It's hard to fly with.

95
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,138
She certainly reads the wind well.
Not far now.

96
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,384
Oh... Lord Yupa.

97
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,886
-Welcome.
-Are you in good health?

98
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,641
The waters and winds are clear and calm.

99
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,726
Lord Yupa.

100
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
Hello all, you're looking well.

101
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,328
Lord Yupa.

102
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,666
We've missed you.

103
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,921
Princess, he has come.

104
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,131
Wait.

105
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Lord Yupa.

106
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,011
Old Mito, you're hard at work.

107
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,724
Tonight I'll hear tales of your travels.

108
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,435
OK, start it.

109
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,364
-Seems to work.
-Yes.

110
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,370
This is excellent.

111
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,665
Tomorrow,
we'll send people to get the rest.

112
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,751
Come, Toeto.

113
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,047
Lord Yupa,
this is Toeto's baby, born this year.

114
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,174
Oh, let's have a look.

115
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,843
A fine baby.

116
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,429
Reminds me of Nausicaä as a baby.

117
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,766
Please be her godfather.

118
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,477
Name her that a fair wind may favor her.

119
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,812
I will indeed.

120
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,731
I'll find her a fine name.

121
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,733
Thank you.

122
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,986
May she grow up as strong as our princess.

123
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,491
She's as strong as they come.

124
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,868
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay.

125
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,746
But that's where I found the Ohm shell.

126
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,500
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'm responsible for this castle.

127
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,002
She's made me sick with worry.

128
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,466
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells.

129
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,261
Indeed, her presence there saved me.

130
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,297
Saved by the girl?

131
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,802
This is a fine valley.
Being here calms my spirits.

132
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,680
How was your journey?

133
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,432
It was terrible.

134
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,811
The Sea of Decay consumed
two more countries to the south.

135
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,356
It's spreading all the time.

136
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,734
And yet, war and hunger are everywhere.

137
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,820
Nothing but bad omens.

138
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,323
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

139
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,954
The ocean winds protect our valley.

140
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,582
The Sea of Decay can't reach us here.

141
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,667
What do you say, Yupa?

142
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,962
Isn't it time you settled in this valley?

143
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,882
Look at my condition.

144
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,758
It would please everyone.

145
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,469
Don't bother.

146
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,725
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever.

147
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,603
Fate, huh...

148
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,647
Obaba, what's he searching for?

149
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,902
Oh my, don't you know, Nausicaä?

150
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,113
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

151
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,033
I can no longer see it.

152
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,661
The figure in the left corner.

153
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,042
"...clothed in blue robes,

154
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,337
descending onto a golden field,

155
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,008
to join bonds with the great Earth

156
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,638
and guide the people to the pure land,
at last."

157
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,601
Lord Yupa,
I always thought that was only a legend.

158
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,437
You mustn't tease me, Obaba.

159
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,023
It's the same thing.

160
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:38,028
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries.

161
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,698
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

162
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,785
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

163
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,079
That is what I wish to know.

164
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,471
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

165
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,741
Princess, Princess.

166
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,868
What is it, Mito?

167
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,246
A strange scent on the wind.

168
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,249
It's nearly dawn. I'll be right there.

169
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,258
How is it?

170
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,511
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss.

171
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,989
Over there!

172
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,241
Look!

173
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,165
It's a ship.

174
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,250
Why would a ship be here?

175
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,755
-What is it?
-Lord Yupa. It's a ship.

176
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,757
-A ship!
-It's coming closer.

177
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,681
It's huge!

178
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,485
-It's a Tolmekian ship.
-It's not flying right.

179
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,029
It's an emergency landing.

180
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
-Help me up, Gol.
-Okay.

181
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,783
Princess, you must not!

182
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
I'll guide them to the shore.

183
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,289
It's coming about.

184
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,083
Off you go!

185
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,460
Teto!

186
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,156
How dare they!

187
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,283
They must have landed earlier
and killed some insects.

188
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,081
Turn away! You'll crash!

189
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,707
Turn away!

190
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,963
Turn!

191
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,895
The princess.

192
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,314
-The cliffs.
-Let's go!

193
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,025
Everyone to the rescue.

194
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,527
Even the boys!

195
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,013
It's that girl. She's alive.

196
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,867
Where am I?

197
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,243
The Valley of the Wind.
Save your strength.

198
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,219
My name is...

199
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,014
Lastel of Pejite.

200
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,516
My cargo... Burn the cargo...

201
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,018
The cargo...

202
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,020
Please, burn it.

203
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,105
Your cargo, I understand.

204
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,024
Don't worry. It's all in flames.

205
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,028
Thank goodness.

206
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,738
Princess!

207
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,918
That's... The Princess of Pejite.

208
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,056
An insect! An Ushiabu's alive.

209
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,521
Oh no, it's calling its friends.

210
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,982
-It can't fly.
-Bring guns!

211
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,025
No, if you shoot it, it'll call others.

212
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,986
I'll kill it now.

213
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,946
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu.

214
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,365
-Then what?
-Wait.

215
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,575
Mito, bring my glider.

216
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,537
Princess!

217
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,013
Return to the forest.

218
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,472
You're strong, you can fly.

219
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,983
That's a good boy.

220
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,279
-Princess.
-Thanks.

221
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,428
Thank God.

222
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:22,515
No telling how we'd suffer
for even one insect's death.

223
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,116
An Ohm...

224
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,177
Found one! Come!

225
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,262
Here!

226
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,141
So, those were spores stuck to that ship.

227
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,809
They haven't released any toxins yet.

228
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,274
We're almost done.

229
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,443
We can't miss a single one.

230
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,661
What on earth is this?

231
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,955
The fire didn't destroy it...

232
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,459
Leave this mystery for later, folks.

233
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,294
Go and help burn the spores.

234
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,253
Alright.

235
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,964
Be careful, now.

236
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,802
Why did they bring
this bundle of trouble here?

237
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,929
Mito, look here.

238
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,355
It's pulsing. Almost like it's alive.

239
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,233
Lord Yupa, what is this?

240
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,903
On my journey, I heard ominous rumors

241
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,657
that a monster from the old world
that had slept beneath Pejite

242
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,991
had been unearthed.

243
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,494
A monster from the old world?

244
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,497
-Giant Warriors.
-The Giant Warriors!

245
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,084
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire.

246
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,503
This...

247
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,805
The Giant Warriors were all said
to have turned to stone.

248
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:56,521
But a single one slept in the earth
for a thousand years.

249
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,526
In... In a way,
the thing looks almost human.

250
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,989
Tolmekia's a savage military state,
far to our west.

251
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,534
And remember
the Pejite captive who perished...

252
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,831
Keep up the good work.

253
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,010
What's that?

254
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,659
Tolmekian ships!

255
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,869
Everyone to the castle!

256
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,837
To the castle!

257
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,089
Gather in the castle!

258
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,466
The castle!

259
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,761
Father!

260
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,232
Obaba, hide yourself.

261
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,734
I'll stay right where I am.

262
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,504
Princess!

263
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,727
How dare you?

264
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,336
Nausicaä...

265
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,384
Stay where you are!

266
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,929
Move, and this sword
carved of insect shell

267
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,390
will pierce your ceramic armor.

268
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,392
That's Yupa.

269
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,978
I ask you Tolmekian warriors.

270
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,774
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships.

271
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,070
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest.

272
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:56,200
Is this how you Tolmekians
treat such a nation, however weak?

273
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,495
If you would make war,
you must have reasons.

274
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,915
You should first send
a messenger to declare them.

275
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,505
Nausicaä... Be calm, Nausicaä.

276
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,509
<i>If you fight now,</i>
<i>they will slaughter the villagers.</i>

277
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,013
<i>We must survive, wait for our chance.</i>

278
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,808
You... little wench.

279
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,560
Put it down, Kurotowa.

280
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,062
But...

281
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,068
Look at this mess. Killed them all.

282
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,987
Your rebuke stings.

283
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,741
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

284
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,787
We have not come to slaughter.
We wish to talk.

285
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,747
Lay down your sword.

286
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,247
The princess!

287
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,873
Princess!

288
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,878
Listen well!

289
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,423
Her Highness Kushana,
Division Commander

290
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,384
of the Tolmekian Frontier Forces
will speak.

291
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,972
We have come to unify the frontier nations

292
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,392
and build peace in this region.

293
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,646
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay.

294
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,942
Accept our rule, and join our enterprise.

295
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,155
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the Earth!

296
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,698
Burn away the Sea of Decay.

297
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,158
Is that possible?

298
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,953
We have revived
the miraculous skills and power

299
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,415
that once allowed humans
to rule this Earth.

300
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,625
For those who submit to us,

301
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,671
I promise a life free from fear
of the toxins and insects of that swamp.

302
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,886
Wait!

303
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,642
You must not harm the Sea of Decay.

304
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,269
What's that, you old hag?

305
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,189
-Take her away.
-Let her speak.

306
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,318
In the thousand years of the Sea of Decay,

307
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,906
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away.

308
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,493
Yet, each time, herds of Ohms,
blind with rage,

309
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:49,540
have swarmed the Earth like a tidal wave.

310
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,719
Destroying nations, swallowing cities,

311
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,431
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

312
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,517
until they starved to death.

313
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,730
In time, the spores

314
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,441
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh

315
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,570
and engulfed our vast Earth
in this Sea of Decay.

316
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,698
You must not touch the Sea of Decay.

317
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,868
Enough! No more of your ravings.

318
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,787
Ah! What will you do?

319
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,705
Kill me, too?

320
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,417
-You!
-Kill me if you will!

321
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,129
Easy work to murder an old blind woman.

322
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,382
Just as you murdered Jihl.

323
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,424
Not Jihl!

324
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,968
How cruel! He was helpless!

325
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,931
You murderer!

326
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,599
Shut them up!

327
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,934
Show no mercy to impudence!

328
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,688
Wait, everyone! Please listen to me.

329
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,236
I don't want any more sacrifices.

330
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,655
Please.

331
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,199
Princess...

332
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,161
You, too, Obaba.

333
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,622
We must submit to these people.

334
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,973
Step on it.

335
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,979
We're almost there!

336
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,610
Hurry up.

337
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,577
It really is a lovely valley.

338
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,494
I'm against it.

339
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,749
We have orders to send
the Giant Warrior back at once.

340
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,501
An order we can't possibly fulfill.

341
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,672
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight.

342
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,343
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here.

343
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,094
And what if I am?

344
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,182
You expect me to hand over
that monster as a toy for those fools?

345
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,143
You have a point.

346
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,520
I am but a simple soldier.

347
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,439
Such a decision is beyond my position.

348
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,524
You're a sly fox.

349
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,949
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior.

350
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,034
Yes.

351
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,119
Can this gun ship fly?

352
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,996
Yes, we found it here.

353
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,460
Get this straight. I'm not asking you.

354
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,880
But take the princess to Pejite.

355
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,091
Five hostages, the gunship, and food.

356
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,510
You pick the hostages.

357
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,595
Prepare everything for the morning.

358
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,692
Thanks for going as a hostage.

359
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,820
We're fine, but look.

360
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,988
They're taking everything in sight.

361
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,993
I will slip away,
return in secret, and await my chance.

362
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,996
We must prevent
that monster's resurrection.

363
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,081
Yes.

364
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,961
Nausicaä.

365
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,562
Teto, where is she?

366
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,661
Nausicaä! What on earth is this?

367
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,372
These plants are from the Sea of Decay.

368
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,001
I've grown them from spores I collected.

369
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,378
Don't worry, they're not toxic.

370
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,797
Not toxic...

371
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,259
The air here is pure indeed, but...

372
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,264
Why...
with this deadly poisonous plant blooming?

373
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,060
The castle windmill

374
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,270
draws water from deep within the earth.

375
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,024
The sand, too,
comes from the very bottom of the well.

376
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,985
With pure water and soil,

377
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,488
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous.

378
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,491
The pollution lies in the earth itself.

379
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,035
Even the earth of our valley.

380
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,537
Why...

381
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,416
Who made such a terrible mess
of the world?

382
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,044
Did you do this all yourself?

383
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,088
Yes.

384
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,966
To cure my father's illness
and that of others.

385
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,342
But...

386
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,097
I'm closing it down.

387
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,102
I just shut off the water,
and they'll soon wither and die.

388
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,950
Nausicaä.

389
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,452
I frighten myself.

390
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,791
I don't know what my rage will make me do.

391
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,003
I don't want to kill anyone.

392
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,911
Princess.

393
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,165
-We gathered these for you.
-Chiko nuts.

394
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,666
They're for you.

395
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,669
All of you...

396
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,672
So many.

397
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,424
You've worked very hard.

398
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,844
Thank you.

399
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,640
-They're very precious.
-It's not fair, Princess.

400
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,932
All aboard! We're taking off.

401
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,268
There, now.

402
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,062
You mustn't cry.

403
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,440
Don't worry. I'll be home in no time.

404
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,442
Really?

405
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,196
Why, have I ever lied to you?

406
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,197
No.

407
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,699
-Right?
-Yeah.

408
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,201
Promise?

409
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,786
Yes.

410
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,704
Go along, it's dangerous.

411
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,747
OK.

412
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,504
You promised!

413
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,934
Take care of the princess!

414
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,779
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

415
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,531
My back is killing me.

416
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,203
Boy, oh boy, did the princess
ever pick a bunch of losers.

417
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,039
Hey, isn't this strange?

418
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,585
Why do they fly so close together?

419
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,046
Like they're afraid of an attack.

420
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,315
Toxins swirl below the clouds.

421
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,242
Don't move.

422
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,747
A gunship!

423
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,843
Enemy fire! They've hit ship number 2!

424
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,560
I told you so.

425
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,145
Wow, terrifying!

426
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,276
Defense formation!

427
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,820
-That's a Pejite gun ship.
-Pejite!

428
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,210
Damn! They got number 3.

429
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,920
What's the Korvet doing?

430
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,382
Their ships just crumble.

431
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,433
Oh no, he's hit our tail.

432
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,731
The Barge tether snapped.

433
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,155
Hurry, Teto.

434
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,051
Oh no, we're going down.

435
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,761
Princess!

436
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,312
Stop! No more killing!

437
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,822
No more!

438
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,718
Princess.

439
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,312
-Hurry, Mito!
-It burns!

440
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,814
Princess, we're doomed.

441
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,113
-Maybe I can fly it.
-Are you crazy?

442
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:12,949
Hurry, Mito!

443
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,868
What? Right!

444
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,414
-Start the engine! Blast open the door!
-Yes!

445
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,840
Come!

446
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,300
Hurry.

447
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,471
Get inside. Mito, ready?

448
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,473
Ready or not!

449
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,478
-Full throttle when we take off!
-Roger!

450
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,480
-Ready!
-Go!

451
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,743
Put on the toxin mask.

452
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,870
Drop below the clouds to find the Barge.

453
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,300
You're still warm. Don't give up, Teto.

454
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,983
What is this place?

455
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,068
I've never seen such dense toxins.

456
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,113
Keep an eye on the right tail.

457
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,030
It's nearby.

458
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,450
It's still aloft.

459
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,536
Hey! You're right!

460
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:40,787
There it is!

461
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,887
It's the princess! Princess!

462
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,432
Don't give up, everyone.
I'll throw you a rope.

463
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,267
Our hook's broken.

464
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,102
You can't hook us in mid-air.

465
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,856
I don't want to crash
and become insect food!

466
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,608
We'll leap to our deaths!

467
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,111
Don't panic! Ditch your cargo.

468
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,614
-Goodbye.
-Farewell!

469
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,116
Listen to me! Toss your cargo!

470
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,161
-Kill the rear engine.
-What?

471
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,747
-The engine noise is too loud. Hurry!
-Yes!

472
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,373
What?

473
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,464
Princess... What are you...?

474
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,718
Your mask, Princess!

475
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,011
You'll die!

476
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,554
Put your mask on!

477
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,348
I promise you'll be safe.

478
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,099
Trust me and dump that cargo.

479
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,018
We'll do whatever you say.

480
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,604
Please! Put your mask back on!

481
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,570
The princess is smiling.

482
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,822
We're going to be all right.

483
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,448
Hurry! Lose the cargo.

484
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,158
Princess, we're in a nose-dive!

485
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,953
Re-start the engines!

486
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,788
I inhaled.

487
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,584
Hurry, hurry.

488
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,211
Hurry up!

489
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,993
Princess!

490
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,411
Everyone safe?

491
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,163
Don't move!

492
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,417
You!

493
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:34,920
Thanks for saving me.

494
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,923
Why did you save her, Princess?

495
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,758
You're a fool.

496
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,427
You thought I would grovel in gratitude?

497
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,931
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay.

498
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,352
It isn't like the human world.

499
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,272
There's no knowing
what a single gunshot will bring.

500
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,318
That battle hurled ships into this forest.

501
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,903
The insects are furious.

502
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,279
Look up.

503
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,209
The Yamma are sentries.

504
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,169
They'll quickly bring other insects.

505
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,255
We must escape now.
Throw me your extra rope.

506
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,466
-Yes!
-Mito, fix the hook.

507
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,680
Don't move. I give the orders.

508
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,349
What are you so afraid of?

509
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,059
You're just like a lost fox-squirrel.

510
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,936
How dare you?

511
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,729
Don't be afraid.

512
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,191
We just want you to go
back to your own country.

513
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,151
You...

514
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,414
They're here!

515
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,846
Quiet! Don't anger them.

516
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,975
This is an Ohm's nest!

517
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,852
We're surrounded.

518
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,083
They're examining us.

519
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,087
Forgive us, Ohm,

520
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,548
for disturbing your nest.

521
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,635
Please understand, we're not your enemies.

522
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,742
Princess!

523
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,479
He's still alive.

524
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,398
Wait, Ohm!

525
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,955
What's happening?

526
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,166
Their eyes have turned blood-red.

527
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,343
What will you do with the glider?

528
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,847
When the waters quiet,
take off, and wait for me above.

529
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,850
If I'm not back in one hour,
return to the valley.

530
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,477
But...

531
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,562
Princess!

532
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,622
She's gone.

533
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,874
Hand it over.

534
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,671
All right, everyone.

535
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,799
We'll do as the Princess said.

536
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,012
Princess...

537
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:01,955
Damn!

538
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,866
Who are you?

539
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,118
You think only of killing.

540
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,495
My flares and charms won't help now.

541
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,850
It's quicksand!

542
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,066
Damn!

543
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,051
It's been two hours already.

544
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,886
More and more insects.

545
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,472
Princess!

546
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,892
Princess!

547
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,279
Nausicaä.

548
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,241
Nausicaä.

549
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,120
Come here.

550
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,708
Come here.

551
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,919
Father.

552
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,140
Mother's here, too.

553
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,402
No, I don't want to go.

554
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,656
Stay away!

555
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,619
There's nothing here.

556
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,371
I said, there's nothing!

557
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,086
Stay inside.

558
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,298
It's a baby Ohm.

559
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,925
She's being used by the insects.

560
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,262
Give it to me, Nausicaä.

561
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,098
No! It's not doing anything bad.

562
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,935
Insects and humans
can't live in the same world.

563
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,574
Please, don't kill it!

564
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,911
Please!

565
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,347
Teto...

566
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,660
What a strange place.

567
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,207
Hey!

568
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,710
I finally found it.

569
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,712
How are you feeling?

570
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,172
Where are we?

571
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,967
First, let me thank you.

572
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,552
I'm Asbel of Pejite.

573
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,804
Thank you for saving me.

574
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,933
I'm Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.

575
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,311
Where are we?

576
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,356
No wonder you're surprised.

577
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,108
We're beneath the Sea of Decay.

578
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,193
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

579
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,154
Look, we fell from up there,

580
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,156
along with the sand.

581
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,660
We're not wearing masks.

582
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,414
That's right. The air here is pure.

583
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,249
I couldn't believe it myself,

584
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,252
finding this place under the Sea of Decay.

585
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,177
What is it?

586
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,691
Nausicaä, don't wander too far.

587
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,881
What a wonderful tree.

588
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,066
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it.

589
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,228
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well.

590
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:16,365
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above.

591
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,427
Nausicaä.

592
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,349
Are you crying?

593
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,938
Yes. I'm so happy.

594
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,419
Lastel was my twin sister.

595
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,630
I should have been with her.

596
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,175
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

597
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,093
Oh no...

598
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,595
I'm sorry.

599
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,641
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain.

600
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:28,646
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind.

601
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,155
This nut tastes really weird.

602
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,617
It's a chiko nut.
It's really good for you.

603
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:58,008
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

604
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,230
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

605
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,108
You think the strangest thoughts.

606
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:18,779
The trees of the Sea of Decay grew
to cleanse

607
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,365
a world polluted by humans.

608
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,994
They absorb toxins from the earth,

609
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:28,622
generate pure crystals,
die, and turn to sand.

610
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,626
That's what created
these underground caverns.

611
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,006
The insects protect this forest.

612
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:40,759
In that case, we're doomed.

613
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,095
We can't possibly survive,

614
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,806
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years.

615
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:51,520
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading.

616
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,982
You sound just like Kushana.

617
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,236
No!
We don't plan to use the Giant Warriors!

618
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,988
You'll see when you meet
my friends tomorrow.

619
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,407
Let's go to sleep.

620
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,368
We have far to go tomorrow.

621
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,894
All is well.

622
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,565
-On schedule?
-Yes!

623
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,943
The torso is solidifying well.

624
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,637
You're one cute monster.

625
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,431
Makes a poor soldier

626
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,142
think of dusting off old ambitions.

627
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,065
It's grinning.

628
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:22,069
You should've slept
beneath the earth until the end of time.

629
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,238
Counselor!

630
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,700
Her Highness' planes
were attacked by Pejite survivors.

631
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,493
All crashed, except the Korvet.

632
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,495
What about Her Highness?

633
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,707
Her ship exploded in flight.

634
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,335
Counselor.

635
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,048
-The villagers don't know yet?
-No.

636
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,341
OK, we'll head out.

637
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,303
-You stay here and keep working.
-Yes!

638
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:58,397
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

639
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,774
or it's a trap set to destroy me.

640
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,994
Mito and the others have returned.

641
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,746
They're waiting at Acid Lake.

642
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,103
In shame we return without her.

643
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,189
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe.

644
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,236
Releasing me?

645
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,365
Drown the Giant Warrior deep in Acid Lake

646
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,700
and return to your country.

647
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,536
Few of your soldiers remain here.

648
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,083
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

649
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,293
Fire and water are powerless against it,

650
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,505
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk.

651
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:08,092
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back.

652
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,929
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

653
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,098
that another country
had harnessed its strength.

654
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,393
Once its presence here is known,

655
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,521
the great powers will send their armies.

656
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,109
You have but one choice left.

657
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:29,154
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers,

658
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,573
and learn to live with that thing.

659
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:32,991
Look.

660
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,123
An insect did that?

661
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,877
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that.

662
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,588
Burn the Sea of Decay, kill the insects,

663
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,882
and restore the human world.
Why do you hesitate?

664
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:54,513
Steal it from us,
just as we stole it from Pejite.

665
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,394
We shall not give the Giant Warrior life.

666
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,149
-Emergency!
-What's the password?

667
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,276
-I'm in a hurry!
-Wind.

668
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,153
-Valley!
-OK.

669
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,320
Some spores survived!

670
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:11,822
What?

671
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:15,325
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

672
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,710
Hand them over.

673
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,378
Give it to us!

674
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,337
Hurry up!

675
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:29,840
Hurry, or the valley's doomed.

676
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:33,427
-We need our tools back.
-They're spreading as we speak!

677
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,346
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons.

678
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,058
We have no choice.
Release everything but their guns.

679
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,644
The Korvet's taking off.

680
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:43,979
Get through this time.

681
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:47,232
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley.

682
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:47,858
Yes, sir.

683
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,862
Good grief, now this is a real mess.

684
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,072
Hurry.

685
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,365
Hurry.

686
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,786
Find the princess.

687
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,996
Look after the valley.

688
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,373
Be careful until we return.

689
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,547
We're going to the valley.

690
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,940
It's no use, the spores are already here.

691
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,942
And on this side, too.

692
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:32,903
Move!

693
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,071
What are you doing?

694
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,449
Oh no, here, too.

695
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,577
Obaba.

696
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,622
We've no choice but to burn it.

697
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,457
This forest is doomed.

698
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:50,462
If we hesitate,
the Sea of Decay will consume our valley.

699
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,091
Isn't there anything to be done?

700
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:57,553
This forest guarded the reservoir
for three centuries.

701
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,472
Damn! If only they'd never come.

702
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,941
This is getting out of hand.

703
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:12,150
Let's go help them.

704
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,833
Do you think so?

705
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,335
I think it looks the same as ever.

706
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,463
The insects have gone.

707
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:40,220
I wonder why my heart's pounding so hard.

708
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,097
We're almost there.

709
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,017
My friends are just over that mountain.

710
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,997
Pejite looks strange.

711
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,248
What is that haze?

712
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,379
Asbel, your mask.

713
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,885
Insects! All dead.

714
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,887
Head for Pejite.

715
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,890
Be careful,
the Tolmekian army must be there.

716
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,402
Even an Ohm...

717
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,321
It attacked the Great Dome.

718
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,292
Pejite's finished.

719
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,170
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

720
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,298
They wiped out? What do you mean, Asbel?

721
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:45,137
It's a Brig.

722
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,764
My friends' ship!
They're landing. Let's go!

723
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,987
Asbel! You're alive!

724
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,490
What have you done? We can't rebuild it.

725
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,868
You've seen the city.

726
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,495
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away.

727
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,540
But the Giant Warrior isn't here.

728
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:16,001
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind.

729
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,085
How did...?

730
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,464
We haven't exactly been idle.

731
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,257
We've launched our second phase.

732
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,844
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight.

733
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:26,762
What?

734
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,639
What are you going to do?

735
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,266
Who's this, Asbel?

736
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:34,811
Nausicaä from the Valley of the Wind.

737
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:36,521
I owe her my life.

738
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,523
Valley of the Wind...

739
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,525
Tell me, what will happen?

740
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:47,574
You must know, Asbel! Tell me.

741
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,619
They'll provoke an insect attack.

742
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:55,373
So you made them attack Pejite, too!

743
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,754
You're horrible!

744
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:08,011
We simply have to recover
the Giant Warrior before they revive it.

745
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,679
We're doing it to save the world.

746
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:10,639
Please understand.

747
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,683
And so you'll murder
everyone in the valley!

748
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:17,270
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

749
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,647
It's too late.

750
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:21,191
Once they've started,
no one can stop them.

751
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,906
We've lost most of our people
to the Tolmekians.

752
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:30,408
This is the only way.

753
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,377
Let go! Let me fly!

754
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,753
Stop it!

755
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,802
It's horrible now, but the Giant Warrior
will purge the Sea of Decay

756
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:50,387
and rebuild the human world.

757
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:53,348
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians.

758
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,851
No, they want to use it for destruction.

759
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:59,855
You drink water from the wells, too.

760
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,732
Do you know what purifies that water?

761
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:06,570
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

762
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,613
and rivers that humans polluted!

763
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,533
And you want to destroy that!

764
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:13,618
Why did you dig up that Giant Warrior?

765
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:18,582
What choice do we have?
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

766
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:19,958
Never, never!

767
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,420
Tell them, Asbel,
how the Sea of Decay came to be.

768
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,880
How the insects protect this world!

769
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:28,300
Please, Asbel!

770
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,969
What are you doing?

771
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,638
Don't move! Release her.

772
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,016
Calm down, Asbel.

773
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,392
I'm serious.

774
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,060
Release her.

775
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,396
Nausicaä, go, and warn them!

776
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,029
Asbel. Let me go!

777
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:23,313
Fools.

778
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,819
No stopping fighting once it starts.

779
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,613
But he warned us to be careful.

780
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:35,492
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men.

781
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:37,619
Counselor! They got the last man!

782
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,789
-Coming our way?
-I don't know.

783
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:42,749
The whole village is gathering.

784
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:46,920
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

785
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,129
Just as it was with Pejite.

786
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,308
They got our tank!

787
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:03,603
Hurry, get it moving.

788
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,688
Don't panic.

789
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,691
Incoming fire!

790
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:09,734
Forward!

791
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,071
Hurry up!

792
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,614
Maybe this is it?

793
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:17,701
It's moving!

794
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,744
Which way?

795
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,877
Forward, move forward.

796
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,212
I know that.

797
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,017
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks.

798
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,856
She survived.

799
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,983
So much for my dreams.

800
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,193
Your Highness!

801
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,366
We'll hold them off here.

802
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,244
Lead everyone to safety by Acid Lake.

803
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:02,579
All right.

804
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,625
It's just until the princess returns
with the gunship.

805
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,923
Hurry, everyone!

806
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,509
Stop gawking, and help me.

807
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:17,635
My aching back.

808
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,807
The tanks are coming!

809
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,352
-Hurry!
-Faster!

810
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:27,896
I know that.

811
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,997
-Are you sure?
-It's a Pejite Brig.

812
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,833
-I saw it peeking through the clouds.
-OK!

813
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:05,934
Watch out, she's a wild one.

814
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,192
Quickly.

815
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,114
Nausicaä, you may go free.

816
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:20,448
Go warn your valley.

817
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:23,451
Your glider may get you there in time.

818
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,370
It's waiting.

819
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,457
Asbel told me everything.

820
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,460
I'll take your place. Put this on.

821
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,545
You're...

822
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:35,463
Lastel's mother.

823
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,217
Thank you.

824
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,345
I'm so very sorry.

825
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,224
-Everything we've done is wrong.
-Hurry!

826
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,026
-What about her?
-She'll be all right, don't worry.

827
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:04,534
Be careful.

828
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:07,036
We've treated you so badly.

829
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,788
-Over here, Nausicaä.
-Come.

830
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:10,540
Hurry.

831
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,960
Thank you, everyone!

832
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:18,464
Sorry it took so long.

833
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,011
-Can you launch from here?
-I'll try.

834
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,437
A Korvet!

835
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,026
Take cover in the clouds!

836
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:44,199
Stop firing!

837
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:52,332
Idiots!
Nothing but wind and lightning in there.

838
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,340
It's useless! I've lost control!

839
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,934
The ship is breaking apart.

840
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,811
We have to leave the clouds and fight.

841
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,444
They were expecting us.

842
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:31,996
What are they up to?

843
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,666
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us.

844
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,810
Here they come. This is your last chance.

845
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,687
No, I'll stay with you.

846
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,355
I can't abandon all those people

847
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:58,898
and the girl who took my place.

848
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:01,401
Only you can save your people.

849
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,238
Please, go, for our sakes!

850
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,792
The ship is ours.

851
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:19,877
Take no prisoners. Destroy them.

852
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,467
Go, Nausicaä!

853
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,053
Asbel!

854
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,905
Princess!

855
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:30,990
Mito!

856
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,673
Mito! Lord Yupa!

857
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:48,758
Princess.

858
01:29:49,383 --> 01:29:51,761
Hurry, everyone's in!

859
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,472
I'll engage the hook now.

860
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,766
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

861
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,650
This is their last stronghold.

862
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,782
The door won't hold.

863
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:17,036
Anytime. Show them some Pejite pride.

864
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,039
What is that?

865
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:22,083
A bird?

866
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,586
-A ship, a gunship from the valley.
-What?

867
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,430
You...

868
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,816
It's Lord Yupa. Here's a chance for glory!

869
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,119
Surrender. Your Korvet won't be back.

870
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,078
This guy's tough.

871
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:07,086
Princess, you're crazy.
The engine will blow.

872
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,089
Just make it to the valley. Speed up!

873
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,052
Dear God, God of the Wind,

874
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:17,096
please protect my people.

875
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:39,368
They won't budge.

876
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,121
-They're waiting for her return.
-Return?

877
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:45,666
They believe that girl
will return with their gunship.

878
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:49,629
That gunship is a pain.
It's our chance to attack.

879
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,924
Do you know what that ship is?

880
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:55,968
It's from before the Seven Days of Fire.

881
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:59,138
The one they say
went as far as the stars.

882
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,350
It's too strong for our guns,

883
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,268
but bury it in a hole...

884
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,145
I, too, wish to wait.

885
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,650
If she really does return
from deep in the Sea of Decay...

886
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:14,820
I'd like a chance to really talk to her.

887
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,910
Made up your minds?

888
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:24,205
If you'll aid our attack, I'll let you go.

889
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,916
You want to end up like Pejite?

890
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,087
You're a princess, too.

891
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:34,048
You're nothing like our princess.

892
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:35,675
Look at my hand.

893
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,678
That's what King Jihl had.

894
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:42,682
In six more months it will be stone.

895
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,393
But our princess said

896
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:48,271
she liked these hands.

897
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:53,567
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker.

898
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,486
You want to live with the Sea of Decay

899
01:32:55,569 --> 01:32:57,697
even as its toxins ravage you?

900
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:03,703
You use fire. We use it a bit, too.

901
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:06,580
Too much fire, and nothing will grow.

902
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:09,625
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day.

903
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:14,088
Water and wind sustain
a forest for a hundred years.

904
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:17,049
We like the water and the wind.

905
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,845
The sight of our forest
will grieve the princess.

906
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:24,974
Counselor, we await your orders.

907
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,143
-Shut up.
-Yes, sir.

908
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:34,650
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute.

909
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,653
Let them go, Kurotowa!

910
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,156
Huh? You want to wait?

911
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,408
Feed the soldiers.

912
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:44,702
We attack in one hour.

913
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:50,666
Food, huh? Finally, a real meal.

914
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,668
Someone's coming!

915
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:55,671
It's Gol and the others.

916
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,344
What is it?

917
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:03,054
There's no wind.

918
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:04,972
No wind?

919
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:09,060
You're right, the wind's stopped.

920
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,104
Obaba, what is it?

921
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,064
Obaba.

922
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:18,110
Someone... Someone take me outside...

923
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:27,411
The wind's never stopped before.

924
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:44,136
Obaba, my ears hurt.

925
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:48,557
The air...
The very air is thick with rage.

926
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,032
We're close!

927
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:08,244
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
Three minutes to Acid Lake!

928
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:11,247
Idle the engines. Drop beneath the clouds.

929
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,258
What's this glow?

930
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:25,261
Ohms!

931
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:46,782
The Sea of Decay is spreading.
They're headed for the valley.

932
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:49,785
How did they stampede the Ohms?

933
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,793
Someone's baiting them.

934
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,880
Mito! Turn towards Sirius.

935
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:02,381
Yes!

936
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:32,161
It's there. Mito, a flare!

937
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,246
Ready.

938
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:36,582
Fire!

939
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:43,923
What is that?

940
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,144
How cruel.

941
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,813
They're baiting them with a baby.

942
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:01,607
I'll shoot them down!

943
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:03,150
No, Mito!

944
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:07,321
Don't shoot!

945
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:14,453
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

946
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,664
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

947
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:21,001
What can we do?
They'll destroy the valley.

948
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,086
Calm down, Mito.

949
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:24,588
Return the baby to them. Let's try.

950
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,598
What are you doing, Princess?

951
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,225
You go ahead and warn them.

952
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:38,602
Princess!

953
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:39,979
You're not even armed.

954
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:55,119
-That's not one of our flares.
-How far?

955
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,663
Twenty leagues.
The other side of the lake.

956
01:37:58,622 --> 01:37:59,999
Is it a gunship?

957
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:01,041
Probably.

958
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:10,884
That's a distress signal.

959
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,511
It's definitely the gunship.

960
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:15,097
It's been an hour, let's go.

961
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,265
Why not wait?

962
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:18,267
The bloodshed is inevitable.

963
01:38:25,524 --> 01:38:27,359
Infantry advance.

964
01:38:32,364 --> 01:38:33,741
Your Highness, get inside.

965
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:34,700
I'm fine here.

966
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,709
The gunship!

967
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:48,005
Fire!

968
01:38:57,514 --> 01:38:58,682
Hold your fire!

969
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,476
Stop it! Stop!

970
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:05,939
Princess!

971
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,525
Stand by. Don't fire.

972
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:10,361
Your Highness.

973
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,617
-Where's the girl?
-The princess!

974
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,285
She's not here.

975
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,454
The Ohm, a stampede. It's coming this way.

976
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,456
-What?
-The Ohm!

977
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:26,752
The Princess stayed behind to stop them.

978
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,587
This is no time for battle.

979
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:32,508
Everyone run,
find the highest place you can! Now!

980
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,472
Obaba, I see a red glow.

981
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:43,227
It's spreading.

982
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,520
It's coming this way.

983
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,399
You hold on tight.

984
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:52,027
There's no stopping them now.

985
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,321
Don't panic.

986
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,781
-Don't push.
-Calm down.

987
01:39:55,989 --> 01:39:57,449
-It's okay!
-Hurry!

988
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:58,409
There's still time.

989
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:02,413
If I have to die,
I want to die in the valley.

990
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:05,958
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the princess has faith.

991
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,211
Listen, hold them off as long as you can.

992
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:10,462
I'll return soon.

993
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:12,756
Your Highness, not that...

994
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,508
It's not ready yet!

995
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,928
-If not now, when?
-Go!

996
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,310
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

997
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:41,368
Damn! She flies like a bird.

998
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:44,830
She's not an enemy.
She wants to say something.

999
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:47,124
Anyone who interferes is an enemy.

1000
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:51,128
We'd better drop the bait
in the valley soon or die ourselves.

1001
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,134
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire.

1002
01:41:10,814 --> 01:41:12,483
-Now! Fire!
-No!

1003
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,027
-That's Lastel!
-Move!

1004
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:04,076
Ohm...

1005
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:33,772
Don't be angry. Don't be frightened.

1006
01:42:34,147 --> 01:42:35,440
I'm not your foe.

1007
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,403
I'm sorry.

1008
01:42:40,153 --> 01:42:42,990
I'm sorry. I can't ask your forgiveness.

1009
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:45,826
It's too cruel.

1010
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:58,589
Don't move! You'll bleed to death.

1011
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,466
Be good, little one, keep still.

1012
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:12,769
They've found us.

1013
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:14,605
They're coming.

1014
01:43:16,356 --> 01:43:18,901
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1015
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:20,777
The lake is poison.

1016
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:57,189
You...

1017
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:26,510
Good baby.

1018
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:30,597
I'm fine. They're coming for you.

1019
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:40,399
They're turning away.

1020
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:44,444
Ohm! Don't! The valley's that way.

1021
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:50,117
They're lost in their rage.

1022
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:52,494
If I don't calm them, the valley...

1023
01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:09,511
Fools! Drawing them with their own fire.

1024
01:45:09,594 --> 01:45:10,679
We're safe.

1025
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:12,806
We'd better get away. Check the engine.

1026
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:15,642
No, no!

1027
01:45:17,519 --> 01:45:18,729
We can discuss this.

1028
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:20,981
Take us to them.

1029
01:45:21,064 --> 01:45:22,649
I must give them the baby.

1030
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:25,360
What's the point, it's too late.

1031
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:26,403
They'll never stop.

1032
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:33,660
Drop us in front of them, then. Take us.

1033
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:36,163
But you'll die, too.

1034
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,340
Obaba, will we all die?

1035
01:45:48,633 --> 01:45:51,678
If that's our fate, we must accept it.

1036
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:53,930
They don't even waver.

1037
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:57,684
-Let's retreat.
-Idiot! There's nowhere to go.

1038
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:04,316
Don't retreat!

1039
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:06,818
Hold your ground for Her Highness.

1040
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,613
Highness... Your Highness!

1041
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:42,270
Get them!

1042
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:44,231
The Giant Warrior... Giant Warrior.

1043
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:59,121
It's rotting. It's too soon.

1044
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,380
Burn them!

1045
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:10,632
What's wrong?

1046
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:14,136
Are you not descended
from Earth's most evil tribe?

1047
01:47:30,443 --> 01:47:33,989
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire.

1048
01:47:34,322 --> 01:47:36,408
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1049
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:49,546
Destroy them!

1050
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:52,757
What's wrong with you? Hurry up and fire!

1051
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:27,626
We're done for.

1052
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:33,381
The Giant Warrior is dead.

1053
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:35,759
It's for the best.

1054
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:39,554
The Ohm's rage is the fury
of the Earth itself.

1055
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:43,642
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster.

1056
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:49,814
-Princess!
-The princess!

1057
01:49:00,075 --> 01:49:01,701
Not there.

1058
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,078
-It's madness.
-Princess!

1059
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:17,277
The Ohms are changing color.

1060
01:50:39,674 --> 01:50:41,551
Their rage has vanished.

1061
01:50:43,261 --> 01:50:45,555
They stopped. The Ohms stopped.

1062
01:51:03,615 --> 01:51:05,200
Princess!

1063
01:51:12,957 --> 01:51:15,460
The princess is dead.

1064
01:51:16,419 --> 01:51:20,965
She calmed them with her own life.

1065
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:23,593
She saved our valley.

1066
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:25,029
Look...

1067
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:33,037
What is that light?

1068
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:00,773
Teto...

1069
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:17,957
Wonderful.

1070
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,710
Thank you, Ohm.

1071
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:22,712
Thank you.

1072
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:44,943
It's a miracle. A miracle.

1073
01:53:45,568 --> 01:53:49,489
Such friendship and sympathy.

1074
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:52,367
The Ohms have opened their hearts.

1075
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:57,163
Children, watch well, and tell me

1076
01:53:57,247 --> 01:53:58,915
what I cannot see.

1077
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,876
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes.

1078
01:54:03,753 --> 01:54:06,506
It's like she's walking
through golden fields.

1079
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:19,185
"...clothed in blue robes,

1080
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:22,272
descending onto a golden field..."

1081
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:25,817
Obaba...

1082
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:29,946
The ancient legend was true.

1083
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:31,948
Look!

1084
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:34,826
The glider.

1085
01:54:35,159 --> 01:54:37,537
The wind! The wind has returned.

1086
01:56:56,676 --> 01:57:01,097
THE END
