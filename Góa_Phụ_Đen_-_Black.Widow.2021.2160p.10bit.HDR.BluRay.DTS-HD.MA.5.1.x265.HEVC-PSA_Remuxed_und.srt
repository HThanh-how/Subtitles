1
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,608
Girl: Hey, nat!

2
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,670
We're both upside down.

3
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,931
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

4
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,637
No, you will.

5
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,431
You can't hold it much longer.

6
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,848
Told you you'd fall down first.

7
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,314
I told you! I told you!

8
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,942
Told you so!

9
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,408
Mommy!

10
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,497
What happened?

11
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,423
She fell on her knee.

12
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,543
- Oh, you bump your knee?
Young Yelena: Mmm-hmm.

13
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,841
Oh...

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,796
Kiss it better. There we go.

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,928
Oh, come on, little one.

16
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,725
Get up. You're okay.

17
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,895
Come on. You're a brave girl.

18
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,599
Your pain only makes you stronger.

19
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,184
Right, you? Yeah.

20
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,506
Melina: Yeah?
Young Yelena: Look!

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,486
Forest stars.

22
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,778
Melina: Yeah. You know what?

23
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,568
Those are actually
part of the lampyridae family.

24
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,284
And the glow, the glow that you see,

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,916
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

26
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,623
Bioluminescence.

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,712
Come on, time for dinner.

28
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,090
Young Yelena: Bio-goomin-feasants?

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,626
Melina: "Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

30
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,504
Dinner!

31
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,844
Come on, dinner, big girl!

32
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,890
Young Yelena: I want Mac and cheese.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,689
Oh, you want Mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,766
Caviar and champagne.

35
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,768
Grab the napkins.

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,313
You take this. Thank you.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,237
Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for dad?

38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,696
Okay.

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,914
Young Yelena: Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,663
Dad's home!

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,962
Hey, dad.

42
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,544
Hey, baby.

43
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,639
Everything okay?

44
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,899
Alexei: How was everybody's day?

45
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,060
Young Yelena: Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,071
- Alexei: Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,778
- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
Alexei: Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,069
Young Yelena: And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

49
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,121
That was my favorite part

50
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,240
- of the whole day.
- No.

51
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,768
Young Natasha: Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.

52
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,792
How long do we have?

53
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,459
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

54
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,005
I don't wanna go.

55
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,172
Don't say that.

56
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,389
Girls...

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,012
You remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

58
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,891
- Today's the day.
- Yay!

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,858
All right, let's go.

60
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,617
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,817
Melina: Come on, we gotta hurry.
Alexei: Thank you.

62
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,068
- I don't have my shoes.
- Alexeli: Thank you, baby.

63
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,798
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

64
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,210
But I'm still hungry.
Yeah? Guess what?

65
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,753
I got fruit roll-ups in the car.

66
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,770
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

67
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,618
You have it? Yeah.

68
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,822
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

69
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,297
Where are we going?

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Home.

71
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,717
Young Yelena: Mommy, you're silly.

72
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,469
We just left home.

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,645
I want my song.

74
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,109
Bye, bye, miss American pie

75
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,278
drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,824
them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye

77
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,245
singing, "this'll be the day that I die”

78
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,582
"this'll be the day that I die”

79
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,947
Melina: Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

80
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,241
Let's go. Come on, nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

81
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,875
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Come on. Honey, honey.

83
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,327
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

84
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,831
- Melina: Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,052
Melina: Okay. Seat belts.

86
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,983
Okay.

87
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,128
Young Natasha:
Why isn't dad in the plane?

88
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,872
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

89
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,522
Mom?

90
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,783
Mom!

91
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,791
I need you up here.

92
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,245
- Okay.
- Okay.

93
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,289
I need you to pull right.

94
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,049
Mom, you've got blood on you.

95
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,223
It's okay, baby.

96
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,945
Hit the accelerator there.

97
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,161
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,794
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

99
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,302
Let's count together.

100
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,923
Young Natasha and Melina: 45, 50...

101
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,733
Pull back. You can do it!

102
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,936
Pull back. All your strength.

103
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,868
Alexei: Okay.

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,121
Young Yelena: Get up, mommy.

105
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,503
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

106
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,722
The red guardian returns.

107
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,350
The red guardian returns triumphant.

108
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,563
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

109
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,766
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

110
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,941
I wanna get back in it.

111
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,478
General dreykov,
it's been over three years.

112
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,027
Forgive me mom.

113
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,153
I'm scared.

114
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,972
Never let them take your heart.

115
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,621
Did you get it?

116
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,587
And the north institute?

117
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,216
Ashes.

118
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,749
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,959
Dreykov: How is Melina?

120
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,424
Alexei: She'll live. She's strong.

121
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,763
- Young Yelena: Mommy?
- Mom?

122
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,893
- Young Yelena: Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

123
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,679
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelenal

124
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,394
- daddy!
- Get away from her!

125
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,233
Don't touch her!

126
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,940
I will shoot.

127
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,275
Don't touch her!

128
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,941
I will kill you all!

129
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,780
I will shoot.

130
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,327
Don't touch her.

131
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,612
Honey.

132
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,896
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

133
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,039
I don't wanna go back there.

134
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,295
I wanna stay in Ohio.

135
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,176
You can't.

136
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,966
She's only six.

137
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,344
Alexei: You were even younger.

138
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,015
It's okay.

139
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,931
Come here.

140
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,654
You're gonna be all right.

141
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,385
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

142
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:30,034
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

143
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,245
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

144
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,078
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

145
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,351
Dreykov: That one, she has fire in her.

146
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,020
What was her name?

147
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,439
Alexei: Natasha.

148
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,408
Dreykov: Ah... Natasha.

149
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,146
No!

150
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,065
Remove all the defects.

151
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,239
That one

152
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,994
and her.

153
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,583
Young Yelena: No!

154
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,754
Young Natasha: Yelena!

155
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,084
Take it! Take it! No!

156
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,635
No!

157
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,184
Dreykov:
The red room is your home now.

158
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,607
Young Natasha: Get off me! No!

159
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,877
TV reporter:
Undercover spies in our communities.

160
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,713
They took on false identities,
even raised families...

161
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,460
Agent 1: They're topside, sir!
Agent 2: Tier 1 has los!

162
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,303
We've got all exits covered.

163
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,472
All right. Stay alert.

164
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,303
I'm sending in Alpha squad.

165
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,610
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the sokovia accords.

166
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,692
She assaulted the king of wakanda.

167
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,151
Make an example out of her.

168
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,155
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

169
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,543
Do what?

170
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,541
Come after me.

171
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,899
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

172
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,710
Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.

173
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,546
'Cause from my vantage point,

174
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,002
it's the federal fugitive

175
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,260
who's desperate.

176
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,385
Natasha: From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.

177
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,346
What is this, your second triple bypass?

178
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,727
I wouldn't worry about me.

179
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,138
We got barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

180
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,102
the incredible shrinking convict.

181
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,984
Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.

182
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,606
Where you gonna go?

183
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,113
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

184
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,866
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

185
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,531
Romanoff?

186
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,522
Got an empty nest,
secretary Ross.

187
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,648
Her tracker, sir.

188
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,378
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

189
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,880
I have sights on collateral one.

190
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,343
Firing in place of three.

191
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,143
Five, four...

192
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,227
Woman: She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

193
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,935
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

194
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,265
Oksana.

195
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,730
Oh, no.

196
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
What did I do?

197
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,640
Oksana: Free the others.

198
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,238
Yelena, we need a status report.

199
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,616
Yelena, we need a status report.

200
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,796
Converge on team leader.

201
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,056
Ingrid: General dreykov,
we have a deserter.

202
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,644
Permission to activate
taskmaster protocol?

203
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,953
Smile.

204
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,217
After the sokovia accords

205
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,778
the hunt is on
for the remaining avengers...

206
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,495
Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff
are currently on the run.

207
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,661
You're in my bed.

208
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,784
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

209
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,228
Did you get everything on my list?

210
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:03,463
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

211
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,049
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

212
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,838
Fanny Longbottom?

213
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,799
- What?
- What, are you 127?

214
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,557
That is a legitimate name.

215
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,009
We've got a generator outside.

216
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,292
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

217
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,116
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

218
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,063
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

219
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,274
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

220
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,939
Nice.

221
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,861
Are you okay?

222
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,161
Why wouldn't I be?

223
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,241
I hear things. You know, something
about the avengers getting divorced...

224
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,539
Ugh. It's fine.

225
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,326
I'm actually better on my own.

226
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,419
Are you sure?

227
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,171
Yeah.

228
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,949
Because you can tell me, you know.

229
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,809
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

230
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,717
I know. I have friends.

231
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,753
People who have friends don't call me.

232
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,890
And I don't pay you to worry.

233
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,320
Oh, hey.

234
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,617
What's all this junk?

235
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,871
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

236
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,796
Budapest?

237
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,955
Yeah. Budapest.

238
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,293
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

239
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,548
Budapest.

240
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,801
It's "Budapest." Sh. Whatever.

241
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,180
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

242
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,787
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to Chuck it.

243
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,927
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

244
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,608
Hugo drax: You're not
a sportsman, Mr. bond.

245
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,402
Natasha:
Why did you break up the encounter

246
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,506
with my pet python?

247
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,130
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

248
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,660
Moonraker 1
on preset launch program...

249
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,764
Oh, great.

250
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,391
Minus two minutes.

251
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:22,979
Refract crew access...

252
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,780
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

253
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,039
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

254
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,857
You're not here for me.

255
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,089
Oh, shit.

256
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,501
Yelena: I know you're out there.

257
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,271
Natasha: I know you know I'm out here.

258
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,581
Yelena: Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?

259
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,707
Natasha: 'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

260
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,787
Yelena: Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.

261
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,007
Natasha: So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

262
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,712
Is that what we are?

263
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,769
Put it down before I make you.

264
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,024
You put yours down.

265
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,353
Watch your step.

266
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,716
Stay down. Stay down.

267
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,303
Stay down.

268
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,902
Stop.

269
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,447
Truce.

270
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,415
You've grown up.

271
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,336
No shit.

272
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,555
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

273
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,472
I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.

274
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,351
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

275
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,768
Not bullets. Arrows.

276
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,027
Ah, right.

277
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,360
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

278
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,403
You brought it back here?

279
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,601
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

280
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,035
Yelena: It's a synthetic gas.

281
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,576
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

282
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,460
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

283
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,628
from external manipulation.

284
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,000
Maybe in english next time?

285
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,257
It's an antidote to mind control.

286
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,629
Real mature.

287
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,783
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

288
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,922
They can explain it to you.

289
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,590
Tony stark, maybe?

290
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,259
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

291
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,386
Great. Perfect timing.

292
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,647
Where's an avenger when you need one?

293
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,817
I don't wanna be here.

294
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,226
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

295
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,985
Well, what was I supposed to do?

296
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,064
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

297
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,033
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

298
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,572
I kept checking the news,

299
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,164
expecting to see captain America
bringing down the red room.

300
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,342
What?

301
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,877
Taking down the red room?
What are you talking about?

302
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,636
It's been gone for years.

303
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,635
Dreykov's dead.

304
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,184
I killed him.

305
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,434
You don't actually believe that, do you?

306
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,149
You really do believe that.

307
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,730
Dreykov's dead.

308
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,300
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

309
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,051
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

310
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,690
Tell me exactly.

311
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,661
We rigged bombs.

312
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,319
- Who's "we"?
- Clint barton.

313
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,554
Killing dreykov was the final step
in my defection to s.H.I.Le.L.D.

314
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,076
Simple as that?

315
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,167
Yeah, sure, "simple."

316
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,799
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

317
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,927
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian special forces.

318
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,134
Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.

319
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,883
And you checked the body?

320
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,642
Confirmed the kill?

321
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,980
There was no body left to check.

322
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,768
You're forgetting dreykov's daughter.

323
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,858
Natasha: Where are we trying to get?

324
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,873
Yelena: Motorbike! East side
of the building.

325
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,239
They're going east, to the roof.

326
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,298
Copy, in pursuit.

327
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,284
I got you!

328
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,994
No!

329
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,767
Hey.

330
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,981
Don't move. You're hurt.

331
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,358
Let me help you.

332
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,455
I don't wanna do this.

333
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,750
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

334
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,615
Do you believe me now?

335
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,534
How many others?

336
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,074
Enough.

337
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,970
Natasha: Which one's yours?

338
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,468
Black. Brown seat.

339
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,512
Where are my keys?

340
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,430
Ah, bitch.

341
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:20,983
Any day now.

342
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,208
Are you okay?

343
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,267
Fantastic.

344
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,878
You can't just steal a guy's car.

345
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,822
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

346
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,860
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

347
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,559
Okay, you got a plan,

348
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,193
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

349
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,764
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

350
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,188
That's a shit plan.

351
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,088
You're welcome.

352
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,634
Oh, shit. He's back.

353
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,282
Put your seat belt on.

354
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,656
You're such a mom.

355
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,106
Yelena: Natasha, no.

356
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,312
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

357
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,279
No. Not now, trust me.

358
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,835
You okay?

359
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,703
Yeah. Great plan.

360
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,460
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

361
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,426
This is cozy.

362
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,178
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

363
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,922
That must have been fun.

364
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,054
Who the hell is that guy?

365
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,594
Dreykov's special project.

366
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,138
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

367
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,436
It's like fighting a mirror.

368
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,267
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

369
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,106
This doesn't make any sense.

370
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,738
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

371
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,862
What is that supposed to mean?

372
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,993
You didn't say one word
about dreykov's daughter.

373
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,700
You killed her.

374
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,741
I had to.

375
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,706
I needed her to lead me to dreykov.

376
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,648
Barton: We need confirmation
dreykov's in the building.

377
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,702
Natasha: His car is pulling up now.

378
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,562
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

379
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,399
I needed her to be sure.

380
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,184
Barton: Natasha, we clear?

381
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,415
All clear.

382
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,036
And here you are, not so sure.

383
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,709
I needed out.

384
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,022
The red room's still active. Where is 11?

385
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,193
I have no idea.

386
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,105
He moves location constantly.

387
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,740
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

388
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,445
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

389
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,161
Well, it's not smart to attack an avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

390
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,496
I mean, the clue is in the name.

391
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,955
Dreykov kills you,

392
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,872
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

393
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,381
Wait, what are the big ones?

394
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,920
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

395
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,594
Where did you think I was all this time?

396
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,689
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

397
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,101
And you just never made contact again?

398
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,144
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

399
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,856
Bullshit.

400
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,696
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

401
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,670
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

402
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,703
You weren't really my sister.

403
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,581
And the avengers
aren't really your family.

404
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,275
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Natasha: Do what?

405
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,756
The thing you do when you're fighting.

406
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,259
The... like, the...

407
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,175
This thing that you do

408
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,385
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

409
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,015
with the arm and the hair.

410
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,515
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

411
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,141
It's a...

412
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,018
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

413
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,103
I'm not a poser.

414
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,105
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

415
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,942
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

416
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,116
all the time.

417
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,613
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

418
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,200
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

419
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,743
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

420
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,038
Well, then you were fooling yourself

421
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,545
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

422
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,928
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

423
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,305
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

424
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,827
That gas,

425
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,240
the counteragent,

426
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,162
it was synthesized in secret

427
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,991
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

428
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,536
I was on the mission to retrieve if,
and she exposed me

429
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,548
and I killed the widow that freed me.

430
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,299
Did you have a choice?

431
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,257
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

432
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,799
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

433
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,184
They're two completely different things.

434
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,598
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

435
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,391
I'm still not sure.

436
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,868
- Is that all there is left?
- Mmm-hmm.

437
00:47:55,831 --> 00:48:00,040
It's the only thing that can stop dreykov
and his network of widows.

438
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,120
He takes more every day.

439
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,089
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

440
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,539
Just like us when we were small.

441
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,627
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

442
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,171
The rest, he kills.

443
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,139
To him, we are just things.

444
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,557
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

445
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,482
Because there is always more.

446
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,315
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and alexei.

447
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,104
Natasha: Alexei?

448
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,323
Yelena: "Dad."

449
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,920
Yelena: Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?

450
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,753
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

451
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,256
What about you?

452
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,932
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

453
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,064
My parents still live in Ohio.

454
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:08,063
My sister moved out west.

455
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,154
Is that right?

456
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,853
You're a science teacher.

457
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,866
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

458
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,698
Your husband, he renovates houses.

459
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,159
That is not my story.

460
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,039
What is your story?

461
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,001
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

462
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,925
Did you ever wish for kids?

463
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,260
I want a dog.

464
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,934
Where you gonna go?

465
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,693
I don't know.

466
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,448
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

467
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,116
so I guess anywhere.

468
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,458
- Don't.
- Don't what?

469
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,082
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

470
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,173
I can feel it.

471
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,086
Speeches aren't really my thing.

472
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,177
Huh.

473
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,548
It was more like an invitation.

474
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,180
To go to the red room and kill dreykov?

475
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:21,809
Yeah.

476
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,218
Even though the red room
is impossible to find

477
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,349
and dreykov is too slippery to kill?

478
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,565
Yeah.

479
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,566
That sounds like a shitload of work.

480
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:31,938
Yup.

481
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,947
Could be fun, though.

482
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,366
Yup.

483
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,411
I saw where he put the keys.

484
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,003
Top drawer, green cabinet.

485
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,006
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

486
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,592
I've ever bought for myself.

487
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,970
That?

488
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,566
Yeah. You don't like it?

489
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,269
Is that like a...

490
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,354
Is it army surplus, or...

491
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,985
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

492
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,692
But I use them all the time,

493
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,069
and I made some of my own
modifications.

494
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,859
Oh, yeah? Whatever.

495
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,240
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

496
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,703
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

497
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,537
I want to do things.

498
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,501
Natasha: Hmm...

499
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,957
I like your vest.

500
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,836
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

501
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,125
It's good. Yes. I like it.

502
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,670
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

503
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,871
I really don't know where
the red room is, though.

504
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,977
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

505
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,981
But I think I know somebody who does.

506
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,151
Oh, yeah? Who?

507
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,476
We're gonna need a jet.

508
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,612
I said we needed a jet.

509
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,527
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

510
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,283
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

511
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,015
Yelena: I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

512
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,039
Like a real pro.

513
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,446
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

514
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,423
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

515
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,121
- not to your liking?
- Ha!

516
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,876
Natasha: Don't let her wind you up.

517
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,459
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

518
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,467
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

519
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,878
You, too, huh? Tag team.

520
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,139
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

521
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,765
Natasha: Where's the rest?

522
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,599
Voila.

523
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,441
Yelena: Ooh.

524
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,211
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

525
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,481
How is it?

526
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,860
It's dry. It's really dry.

527
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,516
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

528
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,125
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

529
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,831
all my prices go up.

530
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,046
What's that supposed to mean?

531
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,174
Your mate, secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

532
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,307
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

533
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,388
I'm a private contractor.

534
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,395
You are sensitive.

535
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,101
You're a very annoying individual.

536
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,226
- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

537
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,150
That's what you say every time.

538
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,617
So, I have the nuclear code.

539
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:34,249
But there he is.

540
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,962
- Captain America!
- Inmates: America.

541
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:45,257
Finally, the red guardian's time has come!

542
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,634
I grab hold of his shield

543
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:54,512
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

544
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,819
Oh... oh, no.

545
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,689
On...

546
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,195
That guy think he going to beat me.

547
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,861
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

548
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,162
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

549
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,536
and I push him out the window.

550
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,037
And I make my escape. Huh?

551
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,255
What year was this?

552
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,876
I don't know. Like, '83, '84.

553
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,054
I know.

554
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,427
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

555
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,770
Are you calling me a liar, ursa, huh?

556
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,070
Alexei shostakov! Mail call.

557
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,785
Oh, no.

558
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,953
Uh-oh.

559
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,894
Alexei shostakov! Mail call.

560
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,454
Aw, look at the big bear.

561
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,289
Gonna cry, little girl?

562
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:16,060
The famed "red guardian."

563
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,644
When you write back, tell your
fans to use more butter.

564
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,480
Take it!

565
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,605
Come on.

566
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,702
Red guardian forward!

567
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,932
The trumpet is calling!

568
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,151
Today is your lucky day, alexei.

569
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,440
Move to the door on the south wall.

570
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,252
What's up with you?

571
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,587
Can't you read?

572
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,314
Go left.

573
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,809
Just don't make a scene.

574
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,993
The red guardian is escaping!

575
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,244
You made a scene, didn't you?

576
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,882
What now?

577
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,951
Natasha:
We're gettin' you outta here.

578
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,356
Go to the upper level.

579
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,116
Move your ass, super soldier.

580
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,675
He's never going to make it.

581
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,264
Get me closer.

582
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,804
You got a better idea?

583
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,014
Alexei: Natasha.

584
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,197
Such a poser.

585
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,261
Natasha: Seriously?

586
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,854
Whoo!

587
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,724
Sorry!

588
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,103
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

589
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,947
Back up!

590
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,775
Yelena: We're both doing
a really good job.

591
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,914
No.

592
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,714
Okay. Enough of this.

593
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,359
Hal

594
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,238
Whoa...

595
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,411
This would be a cool way to die.

596
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,459
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

597
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,749
Move your ass!

598
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,816
Get us outta here!

599
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,617
Huh.

600
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,409
Wait!

601
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,895
Yes!

602
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,438
I need some help up here!

603
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,369
Farewell, douchebags.

604
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,331
Oh, that was exciting.

605
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,541
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

606
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,132
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

607
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,305
Okay.

608
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,516
Ah...

609
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,145
Wow.

610
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,182
Okay.

611
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,267
Why the aggression, huh?

612
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,528
Is it your time of the month?

613
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,111
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

614
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,490
Or ovaries.

615
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,015
Yeah. That's what happens
when the red room

616
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,559
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

617
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:37,163
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

618
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,795
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

619
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,945
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Alexei: Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

620
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,460
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

621
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,128
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

622
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,464
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
Alexei: No.

623
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:56,846
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

624
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,607
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the red room.

625
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,275
Huh.

626
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,148
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

627
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,732
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

628
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,946
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the western agenda.

629
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,240
I chose to go west to become an avenger.

630
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,363
'Cause they treated me like family.

631
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,373
Alexei: Really? Family?

632
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,830
Well, where are they now?

633
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,667
Where is that family now?

634
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,832
Tell me where the red room is.

635
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,965
I have no idea.

636
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,216
Alexei: Okay?

637
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,852
Come on. You and dreykov were like...

638
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,019
Dreykov? Yeah.

639
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,519
General dreykov, my friend, huh?

640
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,021
Gives me glory...

641
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,187
Soviet union's first
and only super soldier.

642
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,528
I could have been more famous
than captain America.

643
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:54,115
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

644
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,699
Three years!

645
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,832
So tedious, boring me to tears.

646
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,252
No offense, huh?

647
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,748
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

648
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,446
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

649
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,132
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

650
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,950
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

651
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,368
and I say something casually about that.

652
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,392
Maybe, you know,

653
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,513
I want the party
to feel actually like a party

654
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,053
instead of this sourpuss organization.

655
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,393
But instead, no.

656
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,563
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

657
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,853
He just runs off and hides, huh?

658
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,773
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

659
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,784
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

660
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,060
Can we throw him
out the window now?

661
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,062
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

662
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,086
All right.

663
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,582
Why not ask Melina where it is?

664
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,108
Wait, mom Melina?

665
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,123
We thought she was dead.

666
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,005
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

667
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,339
Ew. Alexei: What?

668
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,098
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

669
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,759
She worked directly for dreykov
far more than I ever did.

670
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:03,392
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the red room present day?

671
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,807
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

672
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,733
Uh...

673
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,653
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

674
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,405
No, we're good. We'll make it.

675
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,034
Okay.

676
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,592
You should've brought
the avengers' superjet.

677
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,726
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

678
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,137
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

679
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,814
Alexei: Natasha.

680
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,350
Natasha. Natasha.

681
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,440
Come here, I want to ask you something.

682
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,525
Come, it's important. “What?

683
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,611
Did he talk to you about me?

684
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:01,989
What?

685
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,163
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

686
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,481
Who? What are you talking about?

687
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,746
Captain America.

688
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:14,884
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

689
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,885
Not so much a Nemesis.

690
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,964
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

691
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,495
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

692
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,555
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

693
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,266
and you're gonna ask me about you?

694
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,560
What is with this tension?

695
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,813
Did I do something wrong?

696
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,984
Is that a serious question?

697
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,233
I only ever loved you girls.

698
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,906
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

699
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,911
to achieve your fullest potential,

700
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,894
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

701
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,284
Yes. For you, yes.

702
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,420
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

703
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,966
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

704
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,338
the world has ever known.

705
01:06:56,513 --> 01:07:00,472
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

706
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,598
And Natasha,

707
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:07,646
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

708
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,931
destroying empires from within,

709
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,267
but an avenger.

710
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,154
You both have killed

711
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,697
so many people.

712
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,944
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

713
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,705
I couldn't be more proud of you.

714
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,456
Okay. You can... no.

715
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,371
Let go of me now.

716
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,336
You smell really bad.

717
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,221
So, are we there yet?

718
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,428
You'll know when we're there.

719
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,136
Melina: Slight right.

720
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,688
Straight on.

721
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:52,526
Right.

722
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,148
Slight right.

723
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,485
Oh, very good, my darling.

724
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,821
Yes, very good.

725
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,079
Yes, very good, my darling.

726
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,716
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

727
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,562
Honey, we're home.

728
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,484
Come on, girls.

729
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,296
Welcome to my humble abode.

730
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,712
Make yourself at home.

731
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,928
Let's have a drink.

732
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,437
Natasha: Hey, no funny business.

733
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,857
I am putting away my weapon.

734
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,994
Natasha: Are there
any booby traps around here?

735
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,246
Anything we need to know about?

736
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,910
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

737
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,803
You didn't raise us at all.

738
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,436
Oh, maybe so.

739
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,107
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

740
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,335
Let's drink.

741
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,429
Alexei: Okay.

742
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:22,983
Still fits.

743
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,191
Oh, my god.

744
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,608
Melina: I never washed it once.

745
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,363
Come and drink.

746
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,329
Rise, you workers of salvation

747
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,208
family

748
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,836
back together again.

749
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,634
- Mmm.
- Seeing as our

750
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,881
family construct

751
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,843
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

752
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:57,348
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

753
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,979
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

754
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,266
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

755
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,524
And, uh...

756
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,110
I want to say something
right off the bat.

757
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,401
You haven't aged a day, huh?

758
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:14,695
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

759
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,655
Melina: You got fat.

760
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,950
But still good.

761
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,878
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

762
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,362
- I have a lot of energy.
- Melina: Oh!

763
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,333
Please don't do that.

764
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,429
So, here's what's gonna happen.

765
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,009
Natasha, don't slouch.

766
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,891
- I'm not slouching.
- Melina: Yes, yes, you are.

767
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:38,979
I don't slouch.

768
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,332
You're going to get a back hunch.

769
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,667
- Listen to your mother.
- Natasha: Oh, my god, this...

770
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:42,691
Up, up.

771
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,185
All right, enough. All of you.

772
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,100
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

773
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,840
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

774
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,008
Melina: Eat a little something,
Yelena, for god's sake.

775
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,992
You're gonna tell us
the location of the red room.

776
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,699
That they could stay up late
to catch Santa claus.

777
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,021
What? That was fun. You know,
"he come down the chimney, girls.

778
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,376
"Look out. Where is he?"

779
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,330
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

780
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,373
then you see he's there.

781
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,417
No, no. What? I want them

782
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,232
- to follow their dreams.
- Melina: No good.

783
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,342
Alexei: Reach for the stars, girls.

784
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,007
Finding dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

785
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:22,053
You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.

786
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,099
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

787
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,608
Nor did you.

788
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,482
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

789
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,626
Come in.

790
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,503
Did that pig just open the door?

791
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,759
Yes. It did.

792
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,672
Good boy, alexei. Good boy.

793
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,469
You named a pig after me?

794
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,842
You don't see the resemblance?

795
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,272
See, he sits just like dog.

796
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,687
Amazing. Now, watch.

797
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,262
Alexei: It's a little weird, to me.

798
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:12,812
Stop breathing.

799
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,537
We infiltrated
the north institute in Ohio.

800
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,310
It was a front
for s h.Le.L.D. Scientists.

801
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:26,576
Actually, it was hydra scientists
at that time.

802
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,440
In conjunction with
the winter soldier project,

803
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,331
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

804
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:36,173
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

805
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,757
Was the hub for cognition.

806
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,220
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

807
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,513
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

808
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,524
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

809
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,366
What are you doing?

810
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,155
Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

811
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,536
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

812
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,572
and has no choice but to obey.

813
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,350
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

814
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,286
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
alexei could've survived

815
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,045
11 more seconds without oxygen.

816
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,003
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

817
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,636
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

818
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,051
Good boy, alexei.

819
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,843
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

820
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:29,390
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

821
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,690
And do you know who they test it on?

822
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,108
Melina: Hmm...

823
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,935
No. That's not my department.

824
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,896
Alexei: Ah, come on, come on.

825
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,939
- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.

826
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,574
You're dreykov's architect, hun?

827
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:41,745
Melina: What were you?

828
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,557
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

829
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,683
You were his business partner.

830
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,059
No, no, no. I was patsy!

831
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,369
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

832
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,855
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

833
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,666
Shut up! You are an idiot.

834
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,751
And you're a coward.

835
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,718
You're a coward.

836
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:07,010
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

837
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,804
We're moving on.

838
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,314
Alexei: Never family, hun?

839
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,147
In my heart, I am simple man.

840
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,314
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

841
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,528
I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?

842
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:25,160
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

843
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,992
Who cares? That wasn't real.

844
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,704
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

845
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,618
Don't say that.

846
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,709
Please don't say that.
It was real.

847
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:39,425
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

848
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:42,344
You were my real mother.

849
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,131
The closest thing I ever had to one.

850
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,101
The best part of my life was fake.

851
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,938
And none of you told me.

852
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:58,019
And those agents

853
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,821
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

854
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,445
That was me.

855
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,747
Mmm.

856
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,620
And you, you got out.

857
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,161
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

858
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,042
Are you gonna say anything?

859
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:22,595
No.

860
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,056
Don't touch me.

861
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:29,394
Yelena.

862
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,976
No.

863
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,308
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

864
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,351
I'll go talk to her.

865
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,912
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

866
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,748
Okay.

867
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,918
We, uh... we just sit.

868
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,257
We just sit.

869
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,980
Where are you going?

870
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,487
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

871
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,989
I wish I could believe that you cared.

872
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,988
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

873
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,279
No, you weren't abandoned.

874
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,413
You were selected by a program

875
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,491
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

876
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,128
I was taken?

877
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:51,056
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

878
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,097
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

879
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:57,183
She was like you in that way.
She was

880
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,894
relentless.

881
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,267
What happened to her?

882
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,728
Dreykov had her killed.

883
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,866
Her existence threatened
to uncover the red room.

884
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,324
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

885
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,614
wouldn't warrant an execution,

886
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,373
but, as I said, she was relentless.

887
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,962
I thought about her every day of my life.

888
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:29,386
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

889
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,216
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

890
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:46,854
Then why did you save this?

891
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,711
I remember this day.

892
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,844
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

893
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,464
- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.

894
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:19,474
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

895
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,309
I wanted to open every single one...

896
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,524
So just for a second it would feel real.

897
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,480
Let's stop this.

898
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,531
Why you doing this?

899
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:43,620
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

900
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,413
Do you know I was cycled
through the red room

901
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,090
four times before you were even born?

902
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,671
Those walls are all I know.

903
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,671
I was never given a choice.

904
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,385
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

905
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,013
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

906
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,937
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

907
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,073
Pain only makes us stronger.

908
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,993
Didn't you tell us that?

909
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,414
What you taught me kept me alive.

910
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,124
I'm sorry, I already alerted the red room.

911
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,258
They'll be here any minute.

912
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:39,725
Alexei: So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

913
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,936
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

914
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,388
Cold even for Russia, you know?

915
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,308
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

916
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:48,601
Please stop talking.

917
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,798
- Please wait. Please Walt.
- Please, no.

918
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:50,882
Please, I don't want to talk.

919
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,442
Please. Please.

920
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:55,782
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

921
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:58,447
I am reaching for fish.

922
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,915
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

923
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,001
Splash!

924
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,997
My hands go in the river.

925
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:10,172
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

926
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:14,343
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

927
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:15,628
Oh, my god.

928
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:20,596
Urine is 35 degrees celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

929
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,259
How is this relevant?

930
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,348
You know,

931
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,142
fathers.

932
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,276
No. No.

933
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,439
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

934
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:39,819
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

935
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,490
To me?

936
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,748
To me, you were everything.

937
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:50,788
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

938
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,712
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

939
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,128
as the crimson dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

940
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,635
It's the red guardian.

941
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:06,894
Get out.

942
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,855
Get out!

943
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,859
I can't remember

944
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,868
if I cried

945
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:31,670
when I read about his widowed bride

946
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,917
something touched me deep inside

947
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,255
the day

948
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,218
the music

949
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,471
died

950
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,682
and they were singing

951
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,890
sa 7s Sara

952
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,650
miss American pie American pie

953
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,732
drove my Chevy to the levee

954
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,523
- but the levee was dry
- Was dry

955
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,443
them good old boys

956
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:04,949
drinking whiskey

957
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,868
singing

958
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:12,248
both: "This will be the day that I die”

959
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,455
"this'll be the day..."

960
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,362
Get down.

961
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,201
They think...

962
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,429
I'm sorry.

963
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,527
Let's not keep him waiting.

964
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:33,055
Melina: Request clearance for landing.

965
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,374
Copy that.

966
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,583
You are cleared to land on bay 5.

967
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:36,642
Melina?

968
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,370
We're touching down in one minute.

969
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,106
Then why are we still going up?

970
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,783
Now you'll know how dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

971
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,693
Dreykov: My god.

972
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,407
Look at you.

973
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,375
So, uh,

974
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,575
how was the family reunion?

975
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:22,619
Oh, it was awful.

976
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:23,878
They were clingy,

977
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,081
and too emotional, and needy.

978
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,625
- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.

979
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,210
Yelena belova.

980
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,094
What's the deal with her?

981
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,506
She was the only one affected, right?

982
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,220
As far as I know, yes.

983
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,349
These gasses and antidotes,

984
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,597
it's a pain in my ass.

985
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,151
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

986
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,569
Hmm. I have nine pigs

987
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:48,800
that will require attending to
in my absence.

988
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,032
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

989
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,490
Cut her brain out...

990
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,000
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

991
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,093
This is a much less cool way to die.

992
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,477
Alexel.

993
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,988
Melina: What about Romanoff?

994
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,447
She's a traitor.

995
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:42,415
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

996
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,331
She had nothing.

997
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,293
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

998
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,087
Put that thing in her you do.

999
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,344
You know, uh, chemicals.

1000
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,507
Turn her into one of your pigs.

1001
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:03,641
Can you imagine what I could do
with an avenger under my control?

1002
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,272
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

1003
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:09,856
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

1004
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,400
no mask in the world can hide that.

1005
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:28,457
Welcome home.

1006
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,128
Now, now.

1007
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,589
Don't go breaking my new toy.

1008
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:38,759
Natasha.

1009
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,926
I can't save us.

1010
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,735
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

1011
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:47,764
I pledged my life to a cause.

1012
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,275
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

1013
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,560
Possibly the bravest.

1014
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,229
But I wasn't being brave.

1015
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:55,943
I was coward.

1016
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,196
In Cuba,

1017
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,037
when they came
and took you away from me...

1018
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,917
No cause is worth that.

1019
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,842
You should only sacrifice yourself

1020
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,257
for something...

1021
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,971
How did you do that?

1022
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,016
I designed these cells myself.

1023
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,403
What?

1024
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:38,242
What?

1025
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,110
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

1026
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,872
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1027
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,041
Yelena, it's me. It's mama.

1028
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:52,170
You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.

1029
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,340
What?

1030
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,502
What are you going to do to me?

1031
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:00,888
Melina: Outside right hip.

1032
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,678
Keep her awake

1033
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,555
for the cranial incisions.

1034
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,204
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1035
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,375
Melina: Don't throw a fit.

1036
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,898
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

1037
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:34,162
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1038
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:37,124
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

1039
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:41,966
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

1040
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,552
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1041
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,763
You don't have earpiece.

1042
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,480
What?

1043
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,762
No, she can't hear you.

1044
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,380
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

1045
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,925
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1046
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,521
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1047
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,381
Natasha: So, once we're inside,

1048
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,445
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1049
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:02,654
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1050
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:05,610
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1051
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:10,078
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1052
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,913
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1053
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,498
we can descend within the hour.

1054
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,250
Ah, problem.

1055
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,006
I only have one earpiece set.

1056
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:20,918
I'll give it to Yelena.

1057
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,716
Where did he take the vials?

1058
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,758
Melina: Probably down to cold storage.

1059
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:27,265
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,

1060
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,017
so you have to expose them
to this antidote.

1061
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,145
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1062
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:35,898
Is this your plan?

1063
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,692
My plan is to kill you.

1064
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,272
I'm alive.

1065
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,105
So, what do we do now?

1066
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,491
What was my mother's name?

1067
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,162
Ah...

1068
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,325
Where we buried her,

1069
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,827
there was a tree...

1070
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:57,874
Um...

1071
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,835
A pink blossom.

1072
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,716
Beautiful.

1073
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:03,626
And there was a tombstone

1074
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,421
with her name engraved on it.

1075
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,715
What was her name?

1076
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,300
Ah.

1077
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:16,014
"Unknown."

1078
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,355
You don't feel anything?

1079
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,900
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1080
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:27,317
Is this your haunted past?

1081
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,405
Really?

1082
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:43,629
Thank you, Natasha.

1083
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,473
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1084
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,995
When your bomb exploded,

1085
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,703
it nearly killed my antonia.

1086
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:23,298
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1087
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,800
In the back of her neck.

1088
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,177
Look at her.

1089
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,888
You find it difficult to look at her?

1090
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,140
I do.

1091
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,636
She... she watches everything

1092
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:38,729
and she can do it.

1093
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,311
She's a perfect mimic.

1094
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:46,237
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1095
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,493
Can she hear me?

1096
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,081
What?

1097
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,286
You want to make her feel better?

1098
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,920
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1099
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:11,130
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1100
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,679
But enough of all this bullshit.

1101
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,136
Go to work.

1102
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:20,350
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1103
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,142
Go.

1104
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,329
Well, that was a mistake.

1105
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,081
Was it?

1106
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:42,622
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1107
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:45,382
Try, then.

1108
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,756
Do it.

1109
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,046
Is the safety on?

1110
01:36:58,146 --> 01:36:59,146
No.

1111
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,815
Try your knife.

1112
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:06,775
Dreykov: Ah...

1113
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:14,866
You're in trouble.

1114
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,369
How are you controlling me?

1115
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,575
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1116
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,615
Well, not yet.

1117
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,413
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1118
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:28,169
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1119
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:35,384
I'm very upset with Melina.

1120
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,173
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1121
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,830
Alexei: Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1122
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,685
press buttons and hack computers...

1123
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:42,916
Melina: Yes.
Alexei: I mean, I don't know.

1124
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,043
There's nothing for me to do.

1125
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:46,854
I want to...
I want to break something.

1126
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:47,944
Oh, you do?

1127
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,313
Oh, there is something you can break.

1128
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:09,923
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1129
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,751
Ah, damn it.

1130
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,565
That was disgusting.

1131
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,118
Okay.

1132
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:07,639
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1133
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:12,853
Melina was going to land the red room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1134
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:17,698
Oh, no, no, no.

1135
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:26,541
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1136
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:27,711
Pathetic, huh?

1137
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,540
Yeah, what would you call it?

1138
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:30,941
I would call it...
When was the last time

1139
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,401
that you had a conversation with somebody

1140
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:34,256
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1141
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,385
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1142
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:41,297
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1143
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,057
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1144
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:44,433
You hid in the dark.

1145
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:48,392
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1146
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,978
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1147
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:52,479
You're nothing.

1148
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,777
- Hmm.
- You have nothing.

1149
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:56,862
There are 50 people on this planet...

1150
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:58,273
Oh, stop it.

1151
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,067
Don't tell me to stop!

1152
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:04,157
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1153
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,242
Come on.

1154
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,251
Think I can't take a punch?

1155
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,419
Dreykoqov: On.

1156
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,421
God damn it, you're weak. “Weak?

1157
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,907
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1158
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,546
Dreykov: That's enough.

1159
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:33,266
Dreykov: You wouldn't be so glib

1160
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:37,107
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1161
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:41,323
I own this world. Me.

1162
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,234
You seem desperate to impress me.

1163
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:44,743
I don't need to impress you.

1164
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:47,405
I don't need to impress anyone.

1165
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:51,789
These world leaders, these great men,

1166
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:55,463
they answer to me and my widows.

1167
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,300
Look at them.

1168
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:04,805
These girls were trash.

1169
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:08,017
They are thrown out into the street.

1170
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,767
I recycle the trash.

1171
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,806
And I give them purpose.

1172
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,439
I give them a life.

1173
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,903
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1174
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,282
Melina: I've had a slight setback.

1175
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:34,084
You'll need to get to the widows.

1176
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,188
Dreykov: It's my network of widows

1177
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:58,393
that help me control the scales of power.

1178
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,822
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1179
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:07,076
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1180
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:10,363
My widows can start and end wars.

1181
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:13,332
They can make and break kings.

1182
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,877
You control all of that from here?

1183
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,500
And with you,

1184
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:26,216
an avenger under my control,

1185
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,057
I can finally come out of the shadows

1186
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:35,931
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1187
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:38,891
Girls.

1188
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:51,571
All from that little console?

1189
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,539
Dreykov: Yeah.

1190
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,620
Oh, you find this amusing?

1191
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,460
Why are you smiling?

1192
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,170
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1193
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,554
Thank you for your cooperation.

1194
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:13,225
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1195
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,936
you won't be able to take it from him.

1196
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:19,474
For years, dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1197
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:21,483
in all widows, even me.

1198
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:26,238
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1199
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:28,031
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1200
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:29,658
Not enough.

1201
01:43:29,829 --> 01:43:31,535
This is basic science.

1202
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:34,948
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1203
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,162
you have to sever the nerve.

1204
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:40,335
I can handle that.

1205
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:43,623
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1206
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:46,250
I'll have to finish it myself.

1207
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,381
What are you going to do?

1208
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,634
Sever the nerve.

1209
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:13,938
She's got a gun!

1210
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,450
Melina!

1211
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,415
Melina, stop there!

1212
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:27,508
Drop to the ground!

1213
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:29,483
Precisely what I was thinking.

1214
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,853
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1215
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:47,348
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1216
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,367
Yelena: Fantastic.

1217
01:44:51,535 --> 01:44:53,025
I'm heading to the widows now.

1218
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:55,531
No.

1219
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,741
Melina: We have to go.

1220
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,700
Not so talkative now, are you?

1221
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,460
You took my childhood.

1222
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:49,628
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1223
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,882
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1224
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:06,858
Dreykov: Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1225
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,188
Make her suffer.

1226
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:12,817
I don't wanna hurt you.

1227
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:14,819
You don't wanna hurt me.

1228
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,063
Yelena: Hey.

1229
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:11,762
Are you okay?

1230
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:13,851
That looks like it hurts.

1231
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:16,236
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1232
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,404
I'm sorry.

1233
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,849
What do we do now?

1234
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:26,358
Natasha: Get as far away
from here as possible.

1235
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:28,707
You get to make your own choices now.

1236
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:40,969
We gotta get outta here.

1237
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,283
We need to find dreykowv.
Are you coming?

1238
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:43,513
I'm right behind you.

1239
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:53,520
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1240
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:34,817
Yes!

1241
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,494
Do you see the girls?

1242
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,380
No!

1243
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:11,828
We need to go back.

1244
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:40,766
Melina: We've lost control.

1245
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,295
Antonia.

1246
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:11,297
No!

1247
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:14,307
I'm gonna open the door.

1248
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,934
You're gonna come after me.

1249
01:52:17,105 --> 01:52:19,312
It's okay. It's okay.

1250
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:23,604
I know you're still in there.

1251
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:28,442
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1252
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:43,858
Yelena!

1253
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:46,892
She's on the wing!

1254
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,436
Move! What are you waiting for?

1255
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:51,991
Don't do it!

1256
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:54,612
This was fun!

1257
01:53:54,786 --> 01:53:55,821
No!

1258
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,310
Okay.

1259
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,013
Let's go.

1260
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:04,071
Enough.

1261
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:58,462
I'm sorry.

1262
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,262
Is he gone?

1263
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:08,886
He's gone.

1264
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:28,071
Yelena!

1265
01:57:38,927 --> 01:57:40,212
Yelena?

1266
01:57:46,935 --> 01:57:49,142
We're both upside down.

1267
01:57:57,821 --> 01:58:01,905
Forgive me little sister.

1268
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,596
I should've come back for you.

1269
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:06,780
You don't have to say that.

1270
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:08,156
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

1271
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,288
It was real to me, too.

1272
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:25,556
Yelena: Thank you.

1273
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:41,770
Everybody good?

1274
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,360
I am clearly injured.

1275
01:58:45,785 --> 01:58:47,696
You got something to say?

1276
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:50,073
I'd just mess it up.

1277
01:59:04,429 --> 01:59:06,340
Here comes the cavalry.

1278
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:11,763
Man:
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1279
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:16,437
So, what's our plan?

1280
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,941
You guys go. I'll stay.

1281
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:22,067
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1282
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:24,091
Natasha: I'll hold them off.
Alexei: Natasha, we fight.

1283
01:59:24,115 --> 01:59:25,801
Melina: We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1284
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:27,986
- Natasha: You guys, go.
- Oh, my god.

1285
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:30,903
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1286
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:33,493
there may be some hope for the avengers.

1287
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:34,952
Little bit.

1288
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:39,039
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1289
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:41,751
I know how much you like it.

1290
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,711
Natasha: Shucks.

1291
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:45,042
It does have a lot of pockets.

1292
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,211
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1293
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:50,509
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1294
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:54,983
But you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

1295
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,660
You came back for us.

1296
02:00:16,835 --> 02:00:18,715
We wouldn't leave you behind.

1297
02:00:25,343 --> 02:00:26,799
Yelena: Thank you.

1298
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:33,090
Melina: Hey.

1299
02:00:33,768 --> 02:00:36,555
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1300
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:37,845
Don't worry. I got this.

1301
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,478
I know.

1302
02:00:49,868 --> 02:00:52,780
Melina: Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1303
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:55,782
Come. Come with us.

1304
02:02:30,468 --> 02:02:31,583
You ever not sleep?

1305
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,129
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

1306
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:37,592
Oh, really? Yeah.

1307
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:40,224
What, are you scrapping together
some parts?

1308
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:43,933
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1309
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:51,398
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

1310
02:02:57,412 --> 02:02:59,027
Go on, say it. I wanna hear it.

1311
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,821
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

1312
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,244
I'm impressed.

1313
02:03:04,419 --> 02:03:06,080
Well, yeah.

1314
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:09,329
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

1315
02:03:09,507 --> 02:03:11,998
That's what every man wants to hear.

1316
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:13,962
Where you gonna go?

1317
02:03:15,305 --> 02:03:17,967
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

1318
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:20,302
Turns out I got two, so...

1319
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:22,246
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1320
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:25,057
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

1321
02:03:25,565 --> 02:03:28,056
see if I can't help patch things up.

1322
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:17,241
Come on, Fanny.

1323
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,481
Wow. Sorry.

1324
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:41,909
I'm allergic to the midwest.

1325
02:12:44,415 --> 02:12:47,248
What this woman did,

1326
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:50,251
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1327
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:54,497
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1328
02:12:54,675 --> 02:12:56,165
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1329
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:58,797
I'm just here paying my respects.

1330
02:12:58,888 --> 02:12:59,968
Yelena: Hmm...

1331
02:13:00,389 --> 02:13:02,675
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

1332
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,055
Okay.

1333
02:13:07,229 --> 02:13:08,309
I want a raise.

1334
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:09,812
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1335
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:12,439
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1336
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:15,897
I've got your next target.

1337
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:17,811
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1338
02:13:20,075 --> 02:13:24,865
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

1339
02:13:27,625 --> 02:13:29,581
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
