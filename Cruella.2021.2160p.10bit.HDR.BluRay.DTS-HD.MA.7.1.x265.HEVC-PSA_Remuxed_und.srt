1
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,823
Cruella: Oh, no.
We're starting here? Okay.

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,160
From the very beginning
I've always made a statement.

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,999
Not everyone appreciated that.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,792
That's unfortunate.

5
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,711
Cruella: But I wasn't for everyone.

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,634
Speaking of statements, here's one.

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,637
That necklace is the reason I'm dead.

8
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,768
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

9
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,804
From an early age,
I realised I saw the world

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,043
differently than everyone else.

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,102
Look!

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,337
Well, that's not the pattern.

13
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,588
You have to follow the pattern.

14
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,812
There's a way of doing things.

15
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,591
- That's ugly.
- Cruella: Including my mother.

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,821
That's cruel.

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,819
Your name's estella, not Cruella.

18
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,413
Cruella:
It wasn't her I was challenging,

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,865
it was the world.

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,703
But, of course, my mother knew that.

21
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,958
That's what worried her.

22
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,340
Remember, you belong here
as much as anyone.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,625
They're lucky to have you.

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,043
Agreed.

25
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,380
Hey, what do you say to Cruella
when she tries to get the better of you?

26
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,882
Thank you for coming
but you may go now.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,516
Good. Now say goodbye to her.

28
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,018
Goodbye, Cruella.

29
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,519
And wear the hat.

30
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,597
I don't need the hat.

31
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,651
Well, be polite. And good.

32
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,652
And friendly.

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,606
Cruella: How does the saying go?

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,150
"I'am woman. Hear me roar.”

35
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,570
Well, that wasn't much
of a thing back in 1964,

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,363
but it was about to be.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,452
Hi, my name's estella.

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,710
Look. A skunk's got loose
in the building.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,211
Boy: Nice jacket.

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,373
Hi, I'm Anita.

41
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,757
Estella.

42
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,007
Ignore them.

43
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,465
Just did. But it might not last.

44
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,509
Cruella: "Ignore them"?

45
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,509
Didn't I just say, "hear me roar"?

46
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,287
Students: Fight! Fight! Fight!

47
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,948
Cruella: That didn't sit well
with some people.

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,398
This is a blot on your copybook.

49
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,062
Cruella: Okay, that didn't
sit well with a lot of people.

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,152
Enough.

51
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,858
She deserved it!

52
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,528
Cruella: But I found friends
in unlikely places.

53
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,196
Estella: Hello.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,831
Like this guy.

55
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,163
There's a dog?

56
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,374
Buddy. I found him.

57
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,164
Cruella: And not this guy.

58
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,669
Her. Anita darling.
What a fabulous name.

59
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,138
You could say
I pretty much roared my way

60
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,315
through all of primary school.

61
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,773
Almost.

62
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,950
Well, I think it's clear
what happens now.

63
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,949
Estella, you are expelled...

64
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,079
I'm withdrawing her from your school.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm expelling her.

66
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,396
It's too late because
I withdrew her first,

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,876
so that can't be on her record.

68
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,458
I'd said expelled. I'd already said it.

69
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,168
Hadn't.

70
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,259
Didn't.

71
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,676
And, might I say, your school
seems to turn out horrible children

72
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,008
with no creativity or compassion.

73
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,388
Or genius.

74
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,517
You're out.

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,063
Out!

76
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,222
Cruella: Being a genius is one thing.

77
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,768
Raising a genius, however,
does come with its challenges.

78
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,358
London, here we come!

79
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,272
Well, we don't really have a choice.

80
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,569
You have no school.
It's nothing to celebrate.

81
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,658
Well...

82
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,336
Can't be a fashion designer
in a small town, anyway.

83
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,512
Can we go here?

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,507
Regent's park? Perfect.

85
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,976
When we get to the city,
first thing we'll do,

86
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,513
we'll go to the fountain,
and we'll have a cup of tea

87
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,968
and we'll start planning
how to make this London thing work.

88
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,687
Why are you in your best dress?

89
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,626
I need to make a stop
on our way to the city.

90
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,940
Just ask a friend for a little help
to get us on our feet.

91
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,078
What friend?

92
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,613
Well, a friend because
of the situation that we're in.

93
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,499
I'll be less trouble from now on, mum.

94
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,873
I promise.

95
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,650
Cruella: I meant it when I said it.

96
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,816
When a girl like me
makes a promise like that,

97
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,651
you don't take her to a place like this.

98
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,430
What is this place?

99
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,644
Wear it. It looks good.

100
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,186
Looks better without, I think.
Be yours one day.

101
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,444
It's a family heirloom.

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,656
- Will you mind it for me?
- Really?

103
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,490
Come on, buddy.

104
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,582
Er, estella.

105
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,125
Serious voice.

106
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,416
Stay in the car. I won't be long.

107
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,123
Mum!

108
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,833
I need you to lie low.

109
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,667
Lie low while wearing a hat?

110
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,046
Exactly. Love you.

111
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Love you more.

112
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,398
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

113
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,184
Cruella: I did try to lay low.

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,197
Is that fur and chiffon?
In the one gown?

115
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,658
But, as you can see,
I broke the promise.

116
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,198
Just a little.

117
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,293
Woman: I am. I'm sure
it'll be quite extravagant.

118
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,782
It usually is, isn't it?

119
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,125
John: Go to the east garden.
I'll see what I can do.

120
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,773
Cruella: I figured while mum was busy

121
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,662
seeing her mysterious friena,

122
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,672
I'd just take a little peek.

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,972
The problem was,

124
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,275
that little peek
pretty much blew my mind.

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,358
I had no idea where I was
or what it was.

126
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,112
I just knew that,
for the first time in my life,

127
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,197
I felt like I belonged.

128
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,366
Buddy, unfortunately, did not.

129
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,996
Buddy! No!

130
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,297
Got ya.

131
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,717
Keep the hat on,
before anyone sees that.

132
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,278
Cruella: / could've blamed buddy
for what happened next.

133
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,370
I just need a little help,
just to get us on our feet.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,912
Cruella: But the truth is,
I did escalate things.

135
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,330
Oh, my goodness!

136
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,406
Server: Oh, crumbs!

137
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,072
And I will keep my mouth shut,

138
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,869
and I will never come back here.

139
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,165
- Mum!
- Catherine: She's my life.

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,027
No!

141
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,233
Cruella: There are no words.

142
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,371
Baroness: There's been
the most dreadful accident.

143
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,493
Cruella: It was my fault.

144
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,144
Baroness: Police commissioner Weston!

145
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,701
A woman...

146
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,909
She was threatening me,
demanding money. I...

147
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,251
Cruella: I had killed my mother.

148
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,208
I think they were chasing someone.

149
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,417
Search the grounds!

150
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,736
Cruella: And in that moment...

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,091
Commissioner: Search the grounds!

152
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,844
Cruella: The best I could think to do

153
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,134
was run.

154
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,873
And I ran for a long time.

155
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,288
I made it to London after all.

156
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,875
Regent's park.

157
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,040
But no tea.

158
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,858
It's all my fault, buddy.

159
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,134
No mum.

160
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,134
I never should've gone in.

161
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,224
I was an orphan.

162
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,020
My necklace.

163
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,022
Sad story.

164
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,577
Genius girl turns into stupid girl
who gets her mother killed

165
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,663
and ends up alone.

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,087
But a new day brings new opportunities

167
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,169
or at least a couple of
petty thieves. Horace...

168
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,292
Boy: Sir, please could you
spare some change?

169
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,387
No, sorry.

170
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,837
Cruella: And Jasper.

171
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,562
Morning.

172
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,730
Stay back!

173
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,562
Horace was generally annoying.

174
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,518
Ow!

175
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,108
Go back to your family, little girl!

176
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,443
Jasper was the insightful one.

177
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,698
She has no family.

178
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,189
Cruella: Which was also annoying.

179
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,194
And wink was just plain friendly.

180
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,745
Again, annoying.

181
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,952
Buddy!

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,163
Oil - come on, Horace.

183
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,329
But they were a better option
than being in jail.

184
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,465
Stop!

185
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,841
Police!

186
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,087
Oi, you little scallywags!

187
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,900
That was close.

188
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,648
I think we lost her.

189
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,281
You think?

190
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,573
Where are we?

191
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,780
So, what's your story?

192
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,791
Where are your parents?

193
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,926
My mum's dead.

194
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,254
Cruella: I skipped over the part
where I killed her.

195
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,219
I think you should stay here,
be a part of our gang.

196
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,804
She should what?
What, what, what?

197
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,105
This has not been discussed.

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,482
It's being discussed now.
And we could use a girl

199
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,519
to look innocent and be a distraction.

200
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,110
I wanted to be a fashion designer,

201
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,615
not a thief.

202
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,372
You don't got that many options.
Just us.

203
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,783
Cruella: He was right. I was a fugitive.

204
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,747
Is she crying again?

205
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,756
Her mum died.
You remember what that's like.

206
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,010
And there was one thing
I knew they'd be looking for.

207
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,012
Cripes!

208
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,015
I need to dye my hair.

209
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,515
I don't know, I quite like it.

210
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,194
Cruella: Granted, being a thief
is not exactly a mother's dream,

211
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,564
but she was gone.

212
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,038
Don't worry, we're just getting started.

213
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,603
There's lots more bad things coming...

214
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,707
I promise.

215
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,851
Let's go, buddy.

216
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,192
We're on!

217
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,067
Before I knew it, ten years had passed.

218
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,695
You could even say
we had made a home for ourselves.

219
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,234
Horace! Heads-up!

220
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,066
Two minutes! It's stoppage time.

221
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,472
Cruella: We were like a family.

222
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,407
Horace, let's go!

223
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,868
- A family that's good at...
- Get dressed!

224
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,411
Stealing stuff.

225
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,125
I'm frightfully sorry.

226
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,812
Do you know if piccadilly is the next...

227
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,124
Cruella: Really,

228
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,710
really,

229
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,258
really good.

230
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,631
Oh, this is me.

231
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,066
We expanded our business.

232
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,792
I designed fabulous disguises.

233
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,169
We'd steal.

234
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,297
There you go, madam.

235
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,803
I'd design.

236
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,775
We'd steal.

237
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,100
Not your dog!
We are not coming back here!

238
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,611
Design.

239
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,945
It was a beautiful operation.

240
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,249
I got to do what I love,

241
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,373
and we were reaping the rewards.

242
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,258
But, as good as things were, I felt
I was meant for more in this life.

243
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,544
That my mum would've wanted more for me.

244
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,462
[ Just didn't know what.

245
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,058
Hey! Psst!

246
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,884
What are you doing?

247
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,486
Just bored.

248
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,521
Bored? Are you kidding?

249
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,406
I found a tiny TV.

250
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,114
Japanese fellow asleep on the bed.

251
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,490
Er, excuse me, who are you three?

252
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,668
Run.

253
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,248
Good lord!

254
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,670
Man: Oi! Thieves!

255
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,150
Jasper: Two, three!

256
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,234
Jasper and Horace:
Happy birthday to you!

257
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,357
Happy birthday to you!

258
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,985
Happy birthday, dear estell-la-la-la-la!

259
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,116
Happy birthday to you!

260
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,697
And me and Jasper

261
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,653
and wink and buddy

262
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,748
this is the nicest birthday in...

263
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,626
In a while.

264
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,127
Not for Judy.

265
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,663
- Who's Judy?
- It doesn't matter.

266
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,502
It is not a big deal. She just...

267
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,711
Oh, Judy.

268
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,844
Might be hungry.

269
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,803
- Make a wish.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks, Judy.

270
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,262
What's this?

271
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,182
This is an offer of employment
from Liberty of London.

272
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,725
Entry-level position.

273
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,019
Oh, I hope it's a burger place, right?

274
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,447
No, it's the most fashionable
department store in the city.

275
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,237
How did you do this?

276
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,364
Pulled a couple of strings.

277
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,876
I love Liberty!

278
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,081
Yeah, I know you do.
I see you look at it every time we pass.

279
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,935
Now, I might have padded out
your cv a bit.

280
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,109
As in, completely. Invented it.

281
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,133
We've all done it.

282
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,362
Yeah, we've all done it.
Everyone does it.

283
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,717
Invented a few references.

284
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,253
If they ask you
how you know prince Charles,

285
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,885
you just say it's a Polo thing.

286
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,142
Right.

287
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,394
Happy birthday.

288
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,561
Horace: "Polo thing."

289
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,681
So, what is the angle?

290
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,816
There is no angle,
other than estella living her dream.

291
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,734
Right. Okay. Yeah.

292
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,299
What is it really?
What's the angle?

293
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,279
No, there is...
All right, I'll tell you what,

294
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,568
the angle is that
estella is way too talented

295
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,626
to be doing grifts
with the likes of me and you.

296
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,409
Thanks, Jasper.

297
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,580
It's all right.

298
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,669
Mum, I got my chance.
The one I always wanted.

299
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,752
Trust me, I'm going to keep
my head down and make it.

300
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,421
Cheers.

301
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,894
Cruella: Liberty of London.

302
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,321
It was the pinnacle of fashion
in the '70s.

303
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,240
They carried all the best designers.

304
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,403
And now I worked there.

305
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,921
Now, you mentioned the scarf as well.

306
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,457
Woman: On Tuesday?

307
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,584
I have it right in front of me here.

308
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,965
I told him to be very specific
about what I wrote.

309
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,260
Ah, excuse me, sir.

310
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,141
I had a thought
about the front window...

311
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,438
I gave you your job description.

312
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,022
Don't go outside the boundaries
of your engagement. Please.

313
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,781
Not now.

314
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,319
- Ah! Sir...
- Not now.

315
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,614
No, no, no.

316
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,014
Not now.

317
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,567
Anh!

318
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,612
Sir, I just wanted to say,
I really am a dab hand with a needle

319
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,146
if alterations could use anything.

320
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,870
Why are you talking and not cleaning?

321
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,907
Did you do all the bathrooms
according to the regulations I gave you?

322
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,706
- Soap, water, mop, bleach, Polish?
- I did.

323
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,915
In that order? Yes.

324
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,542
But alterations, you wouldn't...

325
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,083
Regret it.

326
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,304
- Hey.
- Hey!

327
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,726
Hi.

328
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,725
You forgot your lunch.

329
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,439
Thank you.

330
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,393
No.

331
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,487
What?

332
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,564
I'm not letting you in that window,
so you can try and crack the safe.

333
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,830
- That's not the angle?
- No. There is no angle.

334
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,947
There's no angle.

335
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,991
What do you mean, there's no angle?
Come on, wink!

336
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,158
There's no angle.

337
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,288
Jasper: Horace.

338
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,670
Thanks for lunch. Bye, wink.

339
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,719
Really?

340
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,852
Perfect.

341
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,491
I feel sad
that you think that looks good.

342
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,586
What?

343
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,037
I feel sad you think
that looks good.

344
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,932
Afternoon.

345
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,635
Lovely hat.

346
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,474
Whatever covers your neck more.

347
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,111
You have...

348
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:57,694
A circular slice of banana
on your cheek.

349
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,247
Other side.

350
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,411
- My office. Now! Now, now.
- Okay.

351
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,801
Before you fire me,
I have something to say.

352
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,266
Clean my office, top to bottom.

353
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:26,056
And, er, when you come in tomorrow,
try and remember to bring a brain.

354
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,273
That seems uncalled for.

355
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,732
I believe that lurking underneath

356
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,902
that starchy, half-size-too-small,
bum-clencher of a suit

357
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:40,661
lies a kind man who wants
to give a brilliant kid another shot.

358
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,456
Clean, now!

359
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,199
I just can't leave you
looking like that.

360
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,785
It would be cruel.

361
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,016
Why'd you go to sleep in a window?

362
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,430
Who's... what...

363
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,488
Oh...

364
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,862
Oh, but seriously,
how much better do you look?

365
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,989
No! No!

366
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
Hello.

367
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,453
Out! Out!

368
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,750
Oh, farts.

369
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,706
Come with me. Leave the bag.

370
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,445
Thousand apologies.

371
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,584
Horace, no!

372
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,636
I'm calling the police, vandal.

373
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,172
She's coming!
The baroness. She's out front.

374
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
- What?
- The baroness!

375
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,186
She's coming!

376
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,305
No!

377
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,725
Hello. Is there a, er, back way out,
or...

378
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,109
The baroness.

379
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,857
The fashion designer!
I want to see her.

380
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,578
Find the girl.

381
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,296
That's her.

382
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,661
Estella, they're distracted.

383
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,720
Let's go!

384
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,806
Baroness.

385
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,734
Outside. That window display.

386
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,779
I'm so sorry.

387
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,731
I can explain that.

388
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,241
You're right, time to go.

389
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,652
Gerald: Sorry, baroness...

390
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,737
Get her.

391
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,534
She's the vandal who messed up
the whole new window display.

392
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,711
Hello.

393
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,879
We're dealing with it.

394
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,920
All right, easy, easy, easy!

395
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,466
So she works here?

396
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,878
Oh, no, no. She was fired. Yeah.

397
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:27,592
We try to give these wretches a chance,
but, um, breeding.

398
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,469
Need I say more?

399
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,805
So she doesn't work here?

400
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,233
Sorry.
I'm not convinced I know...

401
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,815
You're sweating, and I can smell you.

402
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,152
Brilliant. Thank you.

403
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,355
You. Grubby girl.

404
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,449
Yes?

405
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,649
Jeffrey, card.

406
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,743
Card?

407
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,123
You're hired. This address.
5:00 A.M. don't be late.

408
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,002
Baroness: You're a fool.

409
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,542
That girl put together
a better window display

410
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,968
than I've seen here for 10 years.

411
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,504
Hear, hear!

412
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,468
You were right,
this is a very good shop.

413
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,517
God, it's all so depressing.

414
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:46,042
She liked my window, Jasper.
She liked my window!

415
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,254
I'm happy for you.

416
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,128
It's all thanks to you.

417
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,302
No.

418
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,255
So...

419
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,550
This was the angle, then?

420
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,309
Cruella: It's funny how
those happy accidents

421
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,482
can change the whole direction
of your life.

422
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:06,190
Although, looking back,
"happy" may be the wrong word.

423
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,989
Ah, you.

424
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,957
Quickly, come on!

425
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,282
Right, okay.

426
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,120
Come along. Up here.

427
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,457
Silence!

428
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,017
My last show was a triumph.

429
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,103
Shall I read to you from tattletale?

430
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,651
"Baroness designs stunned
with her reinvention of the a-line

431
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,366
"with a bias cut and higher line...

432
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,585
"That reshapes the silhouette
in such an audacious way

433
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,755
"the audience broke into
rapturous applause at first sight.

434
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,291
"She really is a genius."

435
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,591
I'll read that bit again, shall I?

436
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,554
"She really is a genius."

437
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,010
A triumph.

438
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,725
Take a moment to revel in it.

439
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,691
Oh, that's enough. New show.
We must be perfect. Now go.

440
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,199
Window girl.

441
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,518
Grab a mannequin, some fabric,
and throw something together.

442
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,032
The baroness needs looks.

443
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,452
Looks. Right.

444
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,645
It's foolish.

445
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,860
Unhinged.

446
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,404
Well, you're fired.

447
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,077
Pasty, pasty, pasty.

448
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,205
Hmm.

449
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,205
Why are you speaking?

450
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,086
I think you nicked me.

451
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,998
Just...

452
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,793
Fabrics! Can you get me a red like that?

453
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,838
Oh.

454
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,413
Welcome to second time around,

455
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,124
I'm Artie or art, as in "work of."

456
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,009
Wow! You look incredible.

457
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,511
I hear that all day,
so I guess it's true.

458
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,829
How does that look go on the streets?

459
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,716
Mmm, some abuse and insults, of course.

460
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,225
But I like to say that
"normal" is

461
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,479
the cruellest insult of them all
and at least I never get that.

462
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,689
I couldn't agree more.

463
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,066
Look around, cinderella.

464
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,314
I have everything a girl
or boy could ever want.

465
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,150
If you can dream it, I can dress it.

466
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,366
Dior, 1955, amazing.

467
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,076
Chanel, 1950. Spring collection.

468
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,741
Ah, you know your gowns.

469
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,002
You and I are going to be
very good friends, Artie.

470
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,132
Baroness, '65, in the window.
Winter collection.

471
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,917
I noticed that.

472
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,141
Grubby girl, get me lunch.

473
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,307
Soy salmon, lemon-zest Risotto,

474
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,443
cucumber sliced into two-inch diagonals
at an eighth of an inch width

475
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,987
sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley,
shredded, not torn.

476
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,534
Right.

477
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,200
As the department stores
that stock your range,

478
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,038
we thought perhaps
we could give you some input.

479
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,163
Feedback.

480
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,666
Oh, great. I'll start, shall I?

481
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,417
My feedback.

482
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,212
You're short, you're fat,
you smell like an anchovy,

483
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,098
you're colour-blind
but you pretend you aren't.

484
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,514
You're a man
who can't take responsibility.

485
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,977
Your revenues are down 15%,
your foot traffic by 12 and a half.

486
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,765
Yes, I do my own research.

487
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,151
Your store hasn't been refurbished
since the blitz.

488
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,812
People don't know whether to buy a frock
or duck and cover.

489
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,232
And most of the funds meant for refurbs
are being embezzled by you,

490
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,199
stashing them in Swiss bank
account number 32254766

491
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,030
to be precise.

492
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,659
That's me. Your turn.

493
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,952
I'm all ears.

494
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,921
Good day.

495
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,258
Imbeciles.

496
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,305
Lunch. Now.

497
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,310
Oh. Finally, someone competent.

498
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,155
Whoa!

499
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,692
And someone not.
This is my lawyer, Roger.

500
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,221
Although he spends most of his time
playing piano in a dingy little bar,

501
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,076
actually, he's a good lawyer.

502
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,034
Hi.

503
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,119
Piano's nice.

504
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,335
Yes.

505
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,123
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

506
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,373
Box up my lunch, estella.

507
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,423
It could do with a lining.

508
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,140
You could use tulle to puff it out,
give it some body.

509
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,437
That's what I just said.

510
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,778
Baroness.

511
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,407
Keep up, estella.

512
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,710
Jewels.

513
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,052
And, estella, make the bodice

514
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,846
pencil thin.

515
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,735
Estella, did you make it pencil thin?

516
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,668
All right, how do I look?

517
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,920
- Fabulous.
- Well, I know that.

518
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,041
Show me.

519
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,302
Mmm.

520
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,343
How would you have done it?

521
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,227
Hmm.

522
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,026
I think you're...

523
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,901
Something.

524
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,274
Come along.

525
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,330
I made this.

526
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,582
The baroness said
she thinks I'm something.

527
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,625
I think that's good.

528
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,719
Everything's going so well, mum.

529
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,015
I'm really trying to be
the estella that you wanted.

530
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,515
Mostly. It's working.

531
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,310
I just wish you were here to see it.

532
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,654
Baroness: There's something
about it that irritates me

533
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,410
and I always trust my instincts.

534
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:21,408
I thought maybe
if you tighten the silhouette...

535
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,668
Oh, you thought, did you?

536
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,544
I think it's better.

537
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,001
Actually, it is.

538
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,928
Your necklace.

539
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,094
Oh.

540
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,936
Family heirloom. Funny story, actually.

541
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,230
An employee once stole it.

542
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,317
No, she did not.

543
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,895
Sorry.

544
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,357
Slight tone delivery problem. I meant...

545
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:59,120
"No. She did not."
Did she work for you?

546
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,576
Mmm. Once. Years before.

547
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,867
She stole this,

548
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,536
was stupid enough to come back

549
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,545
and then she fell off a cliff and died.

550
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,418
How terrible.

551
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,613
Yes, it was, actually.
It was during my winter ball

552
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,299
and her death really overshadowed
the whole thing.

553
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,013
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

554
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,435
Who was the woman?

555
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,304
Not really the point of the story.

556
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,065
The story's about how lucky I am,
but anyway, she had a kid.

557
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,895
Kid's a snowflake.
Special, blah-blah-blah.

558
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,860
It was a basic shakedown
situation actually.

559
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,828
Maybe she...

560
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,997
Maybe she just really loved her kid.

561
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,159
Maybe she only had one person
to take care of

562
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,960
and she failed dismally.

563
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,477
Speak.

564
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,937
Baroness, we have that meeting
at the ritz.

565
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,443
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

566
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,026
Necklace. Roger, shoes.

567
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,613
Don't touch the ankle.

568
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,906
Roger: Yes, sorry. It's in.

569
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,084
Baroness: Come along.

570
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,304
Cruella: My mother hadn't
failed dismally. I had.

571
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,508
And I wasn't going to fail her again.

572
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,812
Told you, she always comes here.

573
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,725
Oi.

574
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,194
You all right?

575
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,398
She called my mum a thief.

576
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,783
Said she failed as a mother.

577
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,536
What? Your mum?
She knew your actual mum?

578
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,574
Yeah, it turns out
that was her party we were at.

579
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,951
Mum worked for her once.

580
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,307
I dropped the necklace
as I was running away.

581
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,672
She must've found it.

582
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,711
It's mine. So I'm taking it back.

583
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,379
- Taking it, as in...
- Stealing it.

584
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,509
Yeah.

585
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,934
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the angle.

586
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,103
Her black and white ball,
that's where we'll do it.

587
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,115
It's our biggest job ever.
Oi, Horace, attention.

588
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,864
Estella: We need fo know
their security setup.

589
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,530
Power nap, nine minutes.

590
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,997
Estella: Where the cameras are.

591
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,338
Where the guards are posted.

592
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,794
And what the schedules are.

593
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,681
We need to know every detail
and every blind spot.

594
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,664
Okay,
the toilet's just on the left,

595
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,819
and then go straight down to the end.

596
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,174
Thanks.

597
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,728
Estella: Then, all we need to do
is disable the security system,

598
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,562
bypass the cameras,
open the safe, steal the necklace

599
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,065
during the biggest party of the season.

600
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,026
So many people, her security
will be stretched to the limit

601
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,238
and, just to be sure, a distraction,

602
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,414
where I get the key
to the keypad and safe.

603
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,291
Right, so what is the distraction?

604
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,204
I've discovered she likes to throw women
who offend her sensibilities

605
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,918
out of her parties.

606
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,966
- Old women. Women in gold.
- Ow!

607
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,836
Sad women.

608
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,504
Women who carry poodles.

609
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,012
But also stunningly dressed women
who pull the focus off of her.

610
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,389
What about one of the elderly broads?

611
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,179
Me, Horace. I will be the distraction.

612
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,723
All right.

613
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,768
Besides, wreaking havoc at galas
is my personal speciality.

614
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,359
Well, I don't know about that.
But here's a problem...

615
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,773
Won't she recognise you?

616
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,112
That's a good point.

617
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,430
- I guess.
- And when that happens,

618
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,489
won't you lose your job?

619
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,699
It's not on the board.

620
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,550
- A job I think you love.
- Are you thinking?

621
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,977
I mean, she sees you're talented, right?

622
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,081
Yes. Yes.

623
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,953
Well, maybe...
Maybe you don't need the necklace.

624
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,371
Maybe...

625
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,335
Mate, come on! This is the angle.

626
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,375
- It's just a necklace.
- I want it back!

627
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,841
She's the boss.

628
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:12,891
And you're right.

629
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,055
You're right. She will recognise me.

630
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,270
So estella can't go to the ball,

631
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,529
but I know someone who can.

632
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,585
Horace: Right, let's do it.

633
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,962
Yeah. Let's go and ruin someone's day.

634
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,374
You mean the baroness?

635
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,797
Obviously, I mean the baroness.

636
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,888
Right.

637
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,053
Why? Who did you think I...

638
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,099
No, you said "someone."

639
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,599
- Someone could be anyone...
- Let's just do this, Horace.

640
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,239
Not tonight, son.

641
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,701
Well, you know what?
They said it was an emergency.

642
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,411
This is a private event.

643
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,755
Kind of vermin I deal with,
they don't wait for an invitation.

644
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,084
What they do is they get in,
they bite posh people

645
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,906
who then froth at the mouth,
their eyes spin

646
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,763
in the back of their heads
and then the posh people die.

647
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,344
That's a beautiful story, mate.
I almost welled up, yeah?

648
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,523
Freeze. Freeze.

649
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,026
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

650
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,280
Well, don't just stand there!
Get in and get him out!

651
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,196
I told you not to turn around.
And wash your hands.

652
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,114
Heck of a rat, yeah?

653
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,746
The size of a dog. But it's a rat.

654
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,660
Miss Anita darling.

655
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,162
Anita: Baroness.

656
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,078
I'm so grateful you've given taftletale
an exclusive tonight.

657
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,704
Not apparently grateful enough
to observe the dress code.

658
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,712
No colour.

659
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,923
Well, my pen must have leaked.
Tools of my trade.

660
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,135
Baroness: No one is interested
in what you write, my dear.

661
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,516
Just in how I look.

662
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,900
You look ravishing, baroness.

663
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,941
Master of understatement, as usual.

664
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,329
Here's...

665
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,993
To me.

666
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,621
Guests: To the baroness!

667
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,344
Do you have a light?

668
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,284
Get her.

669
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,368
Come on, wink.

670
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,788
I'm a wee bit nervous.

671
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,487
This doesn't have to be a scene.

672
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,048
It really, really does.

673
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,720
My arm. I think it's broken.

674
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,594
Is there a doctor?

675
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,768
Oh, no, actually it's fine.

676
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,525
I'd like to remind you all
that I'm doing this in heels.

677
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,494
Ratbane! Abort! They can see you
on the cameras. Abort.

678
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,584
What?

679
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:56,213
There are six of you,
so obviously you'll win,

680
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,471
but the first two of you to arrive
are going to get very badly hurt.

681
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,757
Initiate plan b.

682
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,312
No, no, no!

683
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,931
Oh! Oh! Look at that one!

684
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,112
No. Get out! My wires!

685
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,444
So, discuss amongst yourselves
who that is, hmm?

686
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,575
There we are.

687
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,497
No, no, no.

688
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,241
You hideous freak.

689
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,776
I didn't mean that, wink.

690
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,179
Jasper: All right, we're good.

691
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,423
Oh! I'm so sorry.

692
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,510
Hang on!
We haven't started yet, darling.

693
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,051
Is that two? I lost count.

694
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,895
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just bring her to me.

695
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,068
_0i. Shh.

696
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,236
You're supposed to be dead!

697
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,939
That's a bit much.

698
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,367
Nothing to see here.

699
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,919
Horace, how's it going?

700
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,300
How's it going? Well, I...

701
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,505
Well, I'd say badly.

702
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,014
Oh, no.

703
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,097
Who are you?
You look vaguely familiar.

704
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,350
I look stunning.

705
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,060
I don't know about familiar, darling.

706
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,145
Your hair, is it real?

707
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,657
Black and white ball.
I like to make an impact.

708
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,950
Right. What was your name?

709
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,502
Cruella.

710
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,205
Oh. Mmm.

711
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,922
That's quite fabulous.
And you designed this?

712
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,710
You did, actually. 1965 collection.

713
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,548
Oh, no wonder I love it, it's mine.

714
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,722
I fixed it.

715
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,387
Oh, sit. Do, I insist.

716
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,770
I'm intrigued, and that never happens.

717
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,366
Yes. Aren't they gorgeous?

718
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,032
And vicious.

719
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,458
It's my favourite combination.

720
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,970
What do you want?

721
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,469
I mean, you clearly wanted
to get my attention.

722
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,394
I want to be like you.

723
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,765
You're a very powerful woman.

724
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,365
Let me give you some advice.

725
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:14,202
If you need to talk about power,
you don't have it.

726
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,312
Well, I don't have it, which is why

727
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,022
I need to talk about it,
which is why I'm here.

728
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,446
Am I going to have to catch you up
a lot, or can you keep up?

729
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,417
You're funny.

730
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,008
It's not just rats.
There's mice, lizards...

731
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:34,055
Raccoons. There's a whole mess
of different kinds of...

732
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,351
Oh, that's a hybrid.

733
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,485
Where are you from?

734
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,235
Oh. Well, um...

735
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,987
Up...

736
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,533
North. Well, sort of.

737
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,994
It's a bit south, really, of north,
which is basically west.

738
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,458
All right, that's enough.
I've loved our little chat,

739
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,717
but I'm afraid that now I'm going
to have to have you arrested, um, for

740
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,509
trespassing.

741
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,090
Oh. Is that a rat?

742
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,104
Oh, my god! Get it off!
Get it off! Get off!

743
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,815
Someone's stolen my necklace.

744
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,608
Later, boys.

745
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,532
Now it's a party!

746
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,954
That dog. Stop! Thief!

747
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,042
You're the bravest rat I've ever known.

748
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,391
Oh, we need that!

749
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,404
Well, here's hoping there's a plan c.

750
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:52,655
Why, what's plan c?

751
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,546
No, what I'm saying is,
"is there a plan c?"

752
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:55,988
Yeah, but...

753
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,539
Get inl

754
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,829
yeah.

755
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,206
A bit quicker! You're a dog!

756
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,216
Whoa.

757
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,287
Didn't know you knew how to drive.

758
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,463
- Whoa...
- I don't.

759
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,097
Horace: There's a car!

760
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,440
All right. Stop the car!

761
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,194
Jasper: What's going on?

762
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,831
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Where's she going?

763
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,049
The baroness killed my mother.

764
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,887
What? What are you talking about?

765
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,800
Her whistle, she called the dogs on her,
she was...

766
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,806
It wasn't my fault.

767
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,934
She killed her.

768
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,145
Like she was nothing.

769
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,692
Horace: Oh, blimey.

770
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,416
Cruella: They say there are
five stages of grief.

771
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:32,506
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression and acceptance.

772
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,711
Well, I'd like to add one more.

773
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,260
Revenge.

774
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,225
We should lay low.

775
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,137
Yeah.

776
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,929
That was a bit much last night.

777
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,358
You think? I fell into a cake.

778
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,201
Morning, boys.

779
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,656
Morning.

780
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,536
So, let's begin.

781
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,016
You're not gonna kill her, are ya?

782
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,127
It's not part of the current plan,
but we might need to be adaptable.

783
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,340
So, that's a no?

784
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,223
If you heard a "no," it is.
Now, the necklace.

785
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,929
One of the dalmatians ate it.

786
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,640
Not sure which one,
so you'll need to kidnap all of them.

787
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,734
All right, sorry. Slow down.
What? What are we...

788
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,482
Darling, if I'm going to
need to repeat myself a lot,

789
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,267
this isn't going to work out.

790
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,289
Why you still talking like that?
Grift's over.

791
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,778
The necklace went in one end, yes?

792
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:44,115
It's going to come out the other.
That's how it works.

793
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,748
And what about breakfast?
Which is now on the floor.

794
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,688
What's the rest of the plan?
Where are you going?

795
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,168
Need-to-know basis.

796
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,954
Jasper: But that's not how we usually...

797
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,548
- Work.
- That was rude.

798
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,338
Yeah, but it's her mum, innit?

799
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,169
We gotta cut her some slack.
Help her out.

800
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,963
Well,
it's not seeming like a lot of fun.

801
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,786
- My krispies are on the floor.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

802
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,550
Let's just get the dogs.

803
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,769
Anita darling, my darling.

804
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,443
Estella, it's been so long.

805
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,080
You know, I kept staring
at you at the party,

806
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,623
and then it came to me.

807
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,909
That's estella from school.

808
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,498
It's not estella.

809
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,251
That's the past.

810
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,211
I'm Cruella.

811
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:45,715
So, you go to parties
and you take pictures

812
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:49,059
and you print gossip?
That's your job?

813
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,929
Yes, well. Not as fun as it sounds.

814
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,440
Oh, it doesn't sound fun.
It sounds useful.

815
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,444
Oh.

816
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,689
I'd like to start my own label.

817
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:07,119
Why don't we work together
to create some buzz

818
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,325
for this old rag

819
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,748
that you continually fill
with that old hag?

820
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,832
You have that glint in your eye.

821
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,788
What glint?

822
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,633
Well, I'm starting to remember that

823
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,464
you have a bit of an extreme side.

824
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,301
Well, then you remember
what fun that is.

825
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,183
Now, I want you to help me
tell them who I am.

826
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,705
You notice how some dog owners
look a lot like their dogs?

827
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,791
No. I've never noticed that.

828
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,547
What about now?

829
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,860
All right, let's have a bit of
professionalism, please, Horace.

830
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,986
We got a job to do, all right?

831
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,717
Wink is a very likable dog.
I'm not sure this plan will work.

832
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,340
It'll work.

833
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,971
Remember, wink, they can smell fear.

834
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,685
Settle, genghis.

835
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,328
Man: Qil

836
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,161
told you it'd work.

837
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,497
How can you not love this face?

838
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,639
It's you.

839
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,272
It is. And you're reading about me.

840
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,145
And you're in my shop.

841
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,441
It's me, estella.

842
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:11,785
Oh, my. My, my, my.
You look amazing.

843
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,746
You certainly made a splash.

844
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,038
I'm just getting started, darling.

845
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,085
And I need help.

846
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,918
I want to make art, Artie...

847
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:28,085
And I want to make trouble.
You in?

848
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,086
I do love trouble.

849
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,549
Horace: I'm not the enemy!
Stop that!

850
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,389
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, now. It's all right.

851
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:39,305
Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that! Hey!

852
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,802
Hey! Stop! Hey!

853
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,191
Oh, come on! Those aren't yours!

854
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,655
You got them.

855
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,363
Artie, boys. Boys, Artie.

856
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,033
He actually knows something
about fashion.

857
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,207
Dogs are very aggressive.

858
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,661
Cruella: Well, you have to
walk them, feed them.

859
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,163
Get that necklace out.

860
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,171
Yeah, well, can't you walk 'em as well?
There's no "I" in team.

861
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:05,860
Well, there is an "I" in imbecile. Go!

862
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,840
Hey! No, no, no,
you can't talk to us like that.

863
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,087
We're helping you here.

864
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,627
So don't.

865
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,133
Oh.
Mummy and daddy are fighting.

866
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,309
I'll, er, set up downstairs.

867
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,096
Just stop it. Chill. Just chill.

868
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,602
Come on, dogs. Regent's park it is.

869
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,145
You could be more polite is all.

870
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,483
I don't have time.

871
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,360
I have to go to work.
I'm a designer now.

872
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,451
Seriously?

873
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,989
Keep your enemies close.

874
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:39,080
Voila! Cruella was in a box a long time,

875
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,208
now estella can be the one
who makes guest appearances.

876
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,965
Everyone is laughing at me.

877
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,218
Well, they say all press
is good press, baroness.

878
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,548
Although they have focused
rather on the rats.

879
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,724
Did you happen to notice her hair?

880
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,102
Coincidence.

881
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,181
Apparently, all the young people
are doing it now.

882
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,527
Thank you, John.
You're such an enormous...

883
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,775
Help.

884
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,481
- I do my best.
- Mmm.

885
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,902
She wants you, hurry up.

886
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,199
Come on.

887
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,375
Ah. Here she is.

888
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,707
Late. Grab a pad.

889
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,209
Excuse me.

890
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,920
Cruella: Fashion fact.
The pinnacle

891
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,593
of every London fashion year
is the spring collection.

892
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,761
Excuse me.

893
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,175
My spring collection.

894
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:44,062
I need 12 pieces, and I have...

895
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,480
Let me count.

896
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,362
Cruella: I was going
to take the things she loved most...

897
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,735
Her business,

898
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,985
her status...

899
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,114
Zero.

900
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,622
I need ten pieces that work by 3:00 A.M.

901
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,498
Cruella: Her confidence.

902
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,581
Go.

903
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,091
Thank you.

904
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,712
Gratitude's for losers.

905
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,759
Oh. Good advice, thanks.

906
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:16,889
What did I just say?

907
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,065
Er, don't thank you, so...

908
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,427
Got it. Thank you.

909
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:23,218
- Go.
- Going. So, I'll just...

910
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,436
Mmm?

911
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,420
What do you mean, the dogs have gone?

912
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,144
Well, find them!

913
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,106
Horace. Game's on.

914
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,399
Oh, tournaments...

915
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,785
Oh! You're killing me! You animals!

916
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,037
I sleep on that thing.

917
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,665
I'm watching the game. Forget it.

918
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,871
Oh, Tottenham fans.

919
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,082
So, you're not all bad then.

920
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,257
Two minutes. Necklace?

921
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,715
No. But silence. That's a start.

922
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,880
And, of course, "thank you
for doing all my dirty work, guys."

923
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,721
"Hey, don't worry about it.
We're a team."

924
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,858
Reporter: Baroness! Over here!

925
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,402
"Cruella." Cruella.

926
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,317
What sort of a name is that anyway?

927
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,868
Okay. A proper competitor.

928
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,324
I'll just have to destroy her
as we have so many before.

929
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,663
Find her. And, Roger,
find out everything about her.

930
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,044
I'm more a lawyer than a detective, I...

931
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,458
Yes, I'll do that.

932
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,245
We have no signature piece.

933
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:55,916
And this Cruella person is everywhere.

934
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,794
I want ideas.

935
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,961
Estella, what've you got?

936
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:14,893
You seem upset.

937
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:18,276
My dogs are missing,
my necklace has been stolen

938
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,654
and this Cruella creature is...

939
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,865
This show has to be the best.

940
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:28,574
Can I get you some cucumber?
Thinly sliced.

941
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,075
Go.

942
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:38,542
And get your dried-up,
desiccated little brain working.

943
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,714
Of course. And thank you.

944
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,647
Yes, go to lunch, you lazy fools.

945
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:04,864
Hmm.

946
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,289
What? Hey!

947
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,468
Mmm.

948
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,719
Oh, estella, I am surprised at you
holding out on me.

949
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,679
But I was on my lunch break
in a public space.

950
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,264
Yes, I own the alley.

951
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,521
Really? You can own alleys?

952
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,309
Alleys, designs, people, their souls.

953
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,857
Check your employment contract.

954
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,158
Well, I seem to have found
my new signature piece.

955
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,873
How do you like it?

956
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,050
We need to sue her, for defamation,

957
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,682
false imprisonment, vandalism.
Something.

958
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:59,266
Well, having been through the statute
and talked to the police,

959
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,102
I don't know we have a legal Avenue
for...

960
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,392
I need you to stop talking, Roger.

961
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,570
You do?

962
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,566
So I have a gap to fire you.

963
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,944
There's a gap. You're fired.

964
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,822
Cruella: Roger always blamed me
for getting him fired,

965
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,871
but the real reason
Roger was fired is because...

966
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,580
- Hmm.
- He's Roger.

967
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,839
You'll need more than eyeliner,
you plain little thing.

968
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,505
You do, however,
have an eye for a good shot.

969
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,631
Baroness.

970
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,846
Who is she?
And, more importantly, where is she?

971
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,598
I don't know.

972
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,688
Did you just lie to me?

973
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,188
L... no, I...

974
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,690
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

975
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,152
You will.

976
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,850
Jasper: Getting anything?

977
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,017
Come on!

978
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,849
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

979
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,556
You know, I'm worried about her.

980
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,316
What, estella?

981
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:28,688
Yeah.

982
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,649
Oh, she's just playing a part
for the grift.

983
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,984
Rude part. Hey! Stop that!

984
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,489
Where's the beading for the dress?

985
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,326
Ordered. Just waiting
on this idiot delivery man.

986
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,712
Oh, good day to you, missy.

987
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,965
Got some fashion items
that are most fashionable.

988
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,795
Thank you, most handsome delivery man.

989
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,175
It's...

990
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,924
Stunning.

991
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,677
Hmm.

992
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,438
I've done it again.

993
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,392
Let's go make history.

994
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,233
I need a drink. Estella, come.

995
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,420
Give it to me, for heaven's sake.

996
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,337
Go.

997
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,645
Here's to me.

998
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,445
Who the hell else would I drink to?

999
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,444
To me?

1000
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,283
For creating your signature piece?

1001
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,862
You're helpful to me, is all.

1002
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,748
As soon as you're not, you're dust.

1003
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,499
Inspiring talk.

1004
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,456
Thank you.

1005
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:05,091
You can't care about anyone else.

1006
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,184
Everyone else is an obstacle.

1007
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,930
You care what an obstacle
wants or feels, you're dead.

1008
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,973
If I had cared about anyone or thing,

1009
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:15,234
I might have died,
like so many brilliant women,

1010
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:21,570
with a drawer full of unseen genius
and a heart full of sad bitterness.

1011
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,743
You have the talent for your own label.

1012
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:29,411
Whether you have the killer instinct
is the big question.

1013
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,540
I hope I do.

1014
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,295
Hmm.

1015
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,011
Correct response. Well done.

1016
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,720
We just have to get rid of this...

1017
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,720
Cruella person, don't you think?

1018
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:52,851
Hmm.

1019
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,562
I guess you must hate her.

1020
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,231
Honestly?

1021
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,066
I'm conflicted.

1022
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:02,072
She is good.

1023
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,444
Bold and brilliant.

1024
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,078
But she has made it me or her...

1025
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,035
And I choose me.

1026
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,427
Wow, this guy's
a bit of a blanket.

1027
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,176
What about...

1028
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,230
This?

1029
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,944
Really?

1030
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,106
We're gonna
have to get invasive.

1031
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,330
Jasper: I's risky.

1032
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,579
They gotta know we broke in,
Cruella said.

1033
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:58,504
Yeah, she did, didn't she?

1034
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,715
Yeah, I'm getting
a little tired of Cruella.

1035
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:02,966
Oh, yeah.

1036
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,734
What's going on?

1037
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,864
She tried to break in last night.

1038
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,703
Who did?

1039
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,493
Cruella. Well, it makes sense.

1040
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,879
It's a stunning,
ludicrously expensive gown.

1041
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:43,715
Hmm.

1042
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,635
But Cruella has no shame.

1043
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,545
She may steal my creation.

1044
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,599
I mean, that's a very good idea, right,
if you were...

1045
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,225
Her?

1046
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:22,331
Night. Get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

1047
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,308
Play nice, guys.

1048
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,136
Night.

1049
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:47,987
What?

1050
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,243
I miss estella.

1051
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,823
Goal!

1052
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,082
They really would make fabulous coats.

1053
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,288
Jasper: The dogs?

1054
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,801
I'm joking.

1055
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,756
You know what I miss?

1056
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,283
The Jasper who had a sense of humour.

1057
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,307
Right.

1058
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,286
You know, we've all had
bad things happen to us.

1059
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,551
Me, him, you. But we've always
been there for each other.

1060
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,937
That's all I'm asking.
Is it so hard to back me up?

1061
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:24,316
No. Not estella, that's easy.
But to help Cruella,

1062
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,189
it's a nightmare.

1063
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:29,400
And there's that
understatement thing you do.

1064
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,732
Cruella gets things done.

1065
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,491
Estella does not.

1066
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,698
And I have things to do.

1067
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,579
So if you're done chatting.

1068
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,791
And by "if" I mean you are.

1069
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,189
I'll allow it.

1070
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,045
When estella arrives,

1071
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,088
escort her to my office
and hold her there.

1072
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,259
Very good.

1073
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,969
Although I think you're wrong.
It's not her.

1074
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,596
Do I pay you for your opinions
or for your obedience?

1075
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,723
Well, are you asking my opinion?

1076
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,438
I'll see it's done.

1077
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,404
Speak.

1078
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,953
What do you mean, it's stuck?

1079
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,035
The guests are already arriving.

1080
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,245
_oh!

1081
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,130
There's something wrong with the lock,
your ladyship.

1082
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,133
I don't care what you have to do,
get it open!

1083
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,892
That little...

1084
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,960
Horace: Ladies and gentlemen,

1085
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,831
I present to you...

1086
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,970
Cruella!

1087
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,250
It's got a good beat.

1088
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,139
The music.

1089
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,663
She killed my dogs.

1090
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:02,754
And made a coat.

1091
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,326
Policeman: Oil get out! Come on!

1092
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,995
Oh, how lovely of her
to thank us for our work.

1093
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,706
Yeah, real gracious, wasn't she?

1094
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:39,819
After all we've done for her.

1095
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,243
Whatever happened to that cute
little girl crying on a bench?

1096
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,419
She's gone, mate.

1097
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:48,515
We should've left her
on that park bench.

1098
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,607
Madam, welcome.

1099
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,106
- Mmm. Hello.
- Anything I can get you, please?

1100
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,404
- Oh, er, two lamb korma.
- Okay.

1101
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,565
One tandoori chicken,
and rice all round.

1102
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:05,820
No problem. No problem.

1103
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,361
A fashion riot in regent's park
broke out today.

1104
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,285
Cruella, some call her a designer,

1105
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:13,832
- others a vandal.
- Hmm.

1106
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,253
Questions are being raised over
whether her coat was real dalmatian.

1107
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,505
Madam, are you celebrating?

1108
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,917
Oh, indeed I am.

1109
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,642
The queen is dead!

1110
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:40,358
Long live the queen.

1111
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:48,696
Cruella.

1112
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:49,867
Wow.

1113
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,742
You really are a psycho.

1114
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:56,245
Why, how nice of you to say.

1115
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,585
You showed promise,

1116
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,873
as did estella.

1117
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,918
Oh, am I late for work?

1118
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,841
Gee whiz, boss, how was the show?

1119
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,257
This is between us.

1120
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,347
Let Jasper and Horace,
imbeciles that they are

1121
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,976
for letting you follow them,
let them go.

1122
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:22,359
Oh, I shall. They're going to jail.

1123
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:23,644
Cruella: For what?

1124
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,489
Dognapping?

1125
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:26,987
Your murder.

1126
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,401
No one will believe that.

1127
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,201
Well, I'll have to add your
charred body to the mix

1128
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,788
to help the believability factor.

1129
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,588
Almost.

1130
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:46,173
Guard: Come on, you. Come on.

1131
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,709
Oh, that's nice.

1132
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,592
You're going to kill me
because I upstaged you?

1133
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:54,685
Uh-huh.

1134
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:01,564
I know you killed my mother.

1135
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:04,226
You're going to have to be
more specific.

1136
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,769
What?

1137
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,530
Who exactly?

1138
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,276
Just narrow it down for me.

1139
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,704
On a cliff.

1140
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,196
You called your dogs on her.

1141
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,083
Okay. Now I'm with you.

1142
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,369
Oh, that's why you're peeved.

1143
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,501
Hence this little show.

1144
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:31,299
I'm gonna kill you. And your dogs.

1145
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,053
I'm waiting.

1146
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:41,979
Gents,

1147
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,065
will you let me go for a moment?

1148
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,231
Come on.
I'm sure she's a terrible boss.

1149
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,199
Enough.

1150
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,046
Goodbye, Cruella.

1151
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,597
Dogs.

1152
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,686
Bad dog, genghis.

1153
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,097
I'll tip off the press.

1154
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:26,483
I'd love them to know
that you went out in a

1155
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:28,939
Blaze of glory.

1156
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:13,689
Hold it there. Up there.

1157
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,660
Move back!
It's still a dangerous scene.

1158
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,028
Please, I need you to move back.

1159
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,652
Reporter 1: Breaking news,

1160
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:27,411
Cruella, best known for upstaging
the baroness in the fashion world,

1161
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:28,795
has died tonight.

1162
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,443
Reporter 2: London's
fashion provocateur has died.

1163
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,653
Reporter 1: The baroness and Cruella
had been going head-to-head...

1164
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,906
Reporter 2: The baroness' competition
has gone up in flames.

1165
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:38,343
Reporter 3: Cruella, a shining star
in London's west end fashion scene

1166
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,758
has tragically died tonight
in a warehouse fire.

1167
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:55,866
What?

1168
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:01,914
Tea, miss Cruella?

1169
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,573
Why am I alive?

1170
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,646
Because I dragged you
out of the smoke and flames

1171
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:07,705
before they consumed you.

1172
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,624
I have something for you.

1173
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:23,892
You found it?

1174
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,177
In the fire.

1175
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:30,474
I can assure you it's been,
er, thoroughly bleached.

1176
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:33,278
May I show you something?

1177
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,527
I didn't know it had a key.

1178
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:43,324
John: Mmm-hmm.

1179
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,576
What's it to?

1180
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,412
This.

1181
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:07,643
The baroness has a kid?

1182
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:09,808
You.

1183
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:15,022
May I walk you through it?

1184
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,273
The baron was a sweet old guy.

1185
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,242
The baroness, on the other hand,
she's a true narcissist.

1186
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,371
So,
when she found out she was pregnant...

1187
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,657
I'm pregnant.

1188
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:30,242
John: She wasn't exactly thrilled.

1189
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,245
The baron was delighted.

1190
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,210
So much so that he surprised her
by giving her a family heirloom.

1191
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,042
She took the necklace,
but she had other plans for you.

1192
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,137
Cruella: Stop.

1193
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:42,303
You keep saying "you."

1194
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:44,590
John: You are her daughter.

1195
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,057
I was there when you were born.

1196
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:50,402
The baron was away on business and
she ordered me to do the unthinkable.

1197
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,475
You know what to do.

1198
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:54,440
It was a diabolical request.

1199
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:57,978
I knew I needed to protect you. But how?

1200
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,738
Then I saw Catherine,

1201
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:02,656
the sweetest woman who ever lived.

1202
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,359
She saved you.

1203
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,533
The baroness said the child had died.

1204
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,660
The baron, he, er, wasted away.

1205
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,084
The point I'm making is,

1206
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:21,092
you are the rightful heir
to the baron's entire fortune.

1207
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,759
The mansion, the title. Everything.

1208
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:27,640
That psycho cannot be my mother.

1209
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:31,063
No.

1210
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:46,912
Postman: Qil

1211
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:07,649
So, this is a confusing day.

1212
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:12,198
My Nemesis

1213
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,832
is my real mother

1214
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:21,417
and she killed my other mother.

1215
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,294
I guess you were always scared,

1216
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:32,470
weren't you, that I'd be a psycho

1217
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,806
like my real mum?

1218
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,728
Hmm?

1219
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:45,604
That explains all the
"tone it down, try and fit in" stuff.

1220
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:52,111
Love me into shape,
I suppose, was the plan.

1221
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,037
And I tried.

1222
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:06,795
I really... I tried because

1223
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,965
I loved you.

1224
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:16,392
But the thing is...

1225
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,222
I'm...

1226
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:25,727
Not sweet estella,

1227
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:28,738
try as I might.

1228
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,159
I never was.

1229
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,746
I'm Cruella,

1230
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:46,088
born brilliant,

1231
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:48,833
born bad

1232
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,175
and a little bit mad.

1233
01:36:58,021 --> 01:36:59,761
I am not like her.

1234
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,603
I'm better.

1235
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,149
Anyway,

1236
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:11,901
must dash.

1237
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:15,655
Much to avenge, revenge and destroy.

1238
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,085
But I do love you.

1239
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,418
Always.

1240
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:45,144
Commissioner: The boys are locked up,
but we have a problem.

1241
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,604
Baroness: I don't pay you for problems.

1242
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:49,735
We didn't find her body.

1243
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:50,966
What are you talking about?

1244
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,855
It's on the TV, the radio.

1245
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:55,696
Well, someone tipped them off

1246
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,280
and gave them the wrong tip.

1247
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:04,117
Thank you for your time.

1248
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,536
Incompetent as always.

1249
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:26,515
You're in the way.

1250
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,616
I still can't believe she's dead.

1251
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:50,041
Pull it together, h.
You can't cry in prison.

1252
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,207
Yeah.

1253
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:54,091
Let's just remember estella.

1254
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,502
- Estella.
- Estella.

1255
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,715
No crying.

1256
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,379
Forget Cruella.

1257
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,059
Shh!

1258
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:13,648
Did you hear that?

1259
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:16,360
I heard something.

1260
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:45,847
Policeman 1: Oi, come here!

1261
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,807
Policeman 2: Stay behind and
keep an eye on the prisoners!

1262
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
What?

1263
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,290
Hey.

1264
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,043
- Wink!
- Shh!

1265
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,214
Wink!

1266
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:15,210
You ain't barbecued!

1267
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:17,383
What in the bloody...

1268
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:18,925
Thank you.

1269
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:21,212
You're getting kissed
right on the mouth!

1270
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,846
I don't care where it's been!

1271
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:21,449
Want a ride?

1272
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:23,653
Yeah, we'll walk, thanks.
You're alive!

1273
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:24,744
Oil

1274
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,807
yeah, I've had enough
of being treated like a dog,

1275
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:28,662
thank you. No offence, wink.

1276
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,289
You'll get caught by the cops.

1277
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,771
We did fine before you showed up,
we'll do fine without you.

1278
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:33,795
Horace: Yeah, exactly.

1279
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:34,914
I fancy a fry-up.

1280
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:37,401
- Yeah, I fancy a fry-up without her.
- Jasper: Yeah, me too.

1281
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,040
There's no easy way to say this.

1282
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:44,758
The baroness is my birth mother.

1283
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,978
You just blew my mind.

1284
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,105
It does explain a lot.

1285
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,525
She gave me away to die.

1286
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,564
And then killed the sweetest woman,

1287
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:04,073
albeit a liar,

1288
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:05,653
who ever lived.

1289
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,665
Well, thank you for the crumpets
and the crazy story.

1290
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,747
Good luck with that.

1291
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:17,608
- I might take a few of these.
- Cruella: Jasper!

1292
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,463
We're in a kill-or-be-killed
situation here.

1293
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,592
Yeah, and she's a homicidal maniac,
and you're not.

1294
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:25,970
Well, we don't know that yet.
I'm still young.

1295
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:28,047
It's funny.

1296
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,911
Or it would be,
if I knew you were being funny.

1297
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:30,935
No, not funny.

1298
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,430
I'm joking, I'm joking!

1299
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:34,891
The point is, I can't run.

1300
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,773
She'll find me, Jasper.
You know she will.

1301
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:39,270
We have to stop her.

1302
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,322
I went a bit mad.

1303
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:47,862
I'm sorry.

1304
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,325
You're my family.

1305
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,120
All I have.

1306
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,792
- She used the family card.
- Yeah, she did.

1307
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:06,423
It's working.

1308
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,633
Yeah. All right, fine.

1309
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:11,890
So, what's the plan?

1310
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:19,523
The baroness' charity gala
is this weekend.

1311
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:22,798
We're going to need the home addresses
and measurements of all the guests.

1312
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:23,822
Easy.

1313
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,938
Artie's tribe of dressmakers, of course.

1314
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:27,534
I ike him.

1315
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:29,408
A black cape, pots of paint.

1316
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:30,495
Oh, yeah?

1317
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:31,823
Several boned corsets...

1318
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:33,453
Should we write this down?

1319
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,283
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise there'd be company.

1320
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:39,914
John, this is my family.

1321
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:41,879
They'll be staying a while.

1322
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,380
Hiya.

1323
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:45,749
You're out of crumpets.

1324
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:58,520
“We're closed.

1325
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,130
I was just reading about you,

1326
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,815
the puppy killer.

1327
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,025
Oh, well, I do love spots.

1328
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:08,856
You didn't.

1329
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:10,612
I didn't.

1330
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,110
But people do need a villain
to believe in,

1331
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,904
so I'm happy to fit the bill.

1332
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:16,534
Fabulous.

1333
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,497
Small point, aren't you dead?

1334
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:22,878
I am. Yes.

1335
01:44:23,048 --> 01:44:24,413
Sad, really.

1336
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:26,499
But also helpful.

1337
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:30,011
Now, Artie, I have a plan.

1338
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,546
Of course you do.

1339
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:33,260
And you're going to help me with it.

1340
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,015
Mmm. What do I get?

1341
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:39,387
A night of fabulousness
and mayhem and possible death.

1342
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:42,648
Check, check, not quite sure
about the death though.

1343
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:44,058
It won't be you.

1344
01:44:44,236 --> 01:44:45,476
Mmm. I'll get my coat.

1345
01:45:36,622 --> 01:45:37,828
Woman: For me?

1346
01:45:58,394 --> 01:45:59,509
Heya.

1347
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:06,519
Sorry.

1348
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:11,774
Big night.

1349
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:13,363
Indeed it is.

1350
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,156
Sure about this?

1351
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,327
No, I'm being serious.

1352
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:23,911
And you're cute when you are.

1353
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,459
Okay.

1354
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,049
I know you're in pain.

1355
01:46:30,259 --> 01:46:31,419
Mmm.

1356
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:33,216
And I know that she caused it,

1357
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,801
but, you know, killing her
is not gonna make that go away.

1358
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:43,097
I won't.

1359
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,107
I promise.

1360
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:47,601
All right, cool. Groovy.

1361
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,777
Unless I really, really have to.

1362
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:58,909
Thanks for helping me.

1363
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:03,155
Yeah, well, I find it very difficult
to say no to you sometimes.

1364
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:08,167
It's one of the things I love about you.

1365
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:10,538
Thanks?

1366
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,755
Horace: When I fixed it,
I noticed a name.

1367
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,845
Do you know what this car's called?

1368
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,101
A devil!

1369
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:26,853
It's deville, mate.

1370
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:28,726
Deville.

1371
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:31,851
I like that.

1372
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,149
Come on. Stand to attention.

1373
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,817
Stand up straight.

1374
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:40,912
Good.

1375
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:41,996
It's time.

1376
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:51,628
Psst!

1377
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:00,338
When I said, all those years ago,
"take care of it,"

1378
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:02,598
what did you think I meant?

1379
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,925
Well, I was a little confused.

1380
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,849
I hardly thought you meant

1381
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:10,014
you wanted me to kill your only child.

1382
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,609
And I thought

1383
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,813
we knew each other.

1384
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:20,650
Well?

1385
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:22,784
I hope, for your sake,
she's hidden in your coat.

1386
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:24,414
No, baroness.

1387
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:30,117
George, come here.

1388
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,253
She'll be here tonight.

1389
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,880
I want her caught before she's seen.

1390
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,715
Everyone thinks she's dead.

1391
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:42,809
She'd better be that way
by the end of the night.

1392
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:45,512
I've got a special treat for her.

1393
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:48,177
It'll put a shock through her
and leave her incapacitated.

1394
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:50,141
Give it to me.

1395
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,816
Hmm.

1396
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:57,478
That's marvellous.

1397
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:02,195
Oh, I could do that all day!

1398
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:04,610
Oh! Just find her, you idiots!

1399
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,878
Why am I the only one who's competent?

1400
01:49:16,008 --> 01:49:17,214
Must be very tiring.

1401
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:21,676
Should be a memorable night tonight,
baroness.

1402
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,587
Indeed it should.

1403
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:40,613
All right, boys, look alert.
First vehicle arriving.

1404
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:49,284
Blimey, it's her.

1405
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,876
- Oh.
- I beg your pardon?

1406
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,378
It's not her.

1407
01:49:58,634 --> 01:49:59,965
Here she is, here.

1408
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,673
That's not her.

1409
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,432
- How dare you touch me!
- Sorry, ma'am.

1410
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,264
What's going on?

1411
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:14,267
Time for my entrance, my dears.

1412
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:15,931
- Baroness, I...
- Is she here?

1413
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,550
Well, that's the problem, see, er...

1414
01:50:20,405 --> 01:50:21,565
Police. How can I help?

1415
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,732
There's a robbery planned
for hellman hall this evening.

1416
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,571
Constable: Who is this?

1417
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,403
Jasper:
All teams, baroness requires

1418
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:44,133
everybody in the library now.

1419
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,760
She's angry, boys.

1420
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:14,323
I was just looking for the loo.

1421
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:16,871
Shh.

1422
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,377
_oh.

1423
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,847
Thank you all for coming.

1424
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:16,768
What a great tribute to our dear friend

1425
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:22,357
who shall never return.

1426
01:52:23,528 --> 01:52:24,813
Sadly.

1427
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,404
Touching.

1428
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,819
To Cruella. All: To Cruella!

1429
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,449
Bravo!

1430
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:58,477
That dog is like a son to me.

1431
01:52:58,563 --> 01:52:59,563
You're dead!

1432
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:04,312
I had him.

1433
01:53:04,486 --> 01:53:06,442
Did you, though?

1434
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:20,543
Where is she?

1435
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,326
Didn't you just toast her death?

1436
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:50,862
Where are my guards?

1437
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:30,227
She's here. I can feel it.

1438
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,238
Find her.

1439
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:54,464
Push!

1440
01:56:03,123 --> 01:56:04,158
Get her!

1441
01:56:12,549 --> 01:56:13,880
Sit.

1442
01:56:34,613 --> 01:56:37,275
Hello, Cruella.

1443
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:41,862
I hate to ruin your party,
but I've come to evict you.

1444
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:45,571
Don't be absurd.

1445
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,162
This is the key that was in the necklace

1446
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:52,999
that unlocks the box
my birth certificate was in.

1447
01:56:56,218 --> 01:56:59,176
Hello, mother.

1448
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:06,140
It all makes sense now.

1449
01:57:06,603 --> 01:57:07,603
What?

1450
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:11,305
That you're so extraordinary.

1451
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:13,940
Of course, you're mine.

1452
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:18,733
I've longed for someone in my life

1453
01:57:18,907 --> 01:57:21,319
who was as good as me.

1454
01:57:22,911 --> 01:57:25,072
You left me to die.

1455
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:27,453
A mistake.

1456
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:31,917
And one we can get past. I know it.

1457
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,252
I disagree.

1458
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:36,045
Good evening.

1459
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:38,085
The baroness asks that you join her

1460
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,256
- on the terrace.
- Lovely.

1461
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:42,134
Gentlemen, the baroness would like
to invite you outside, please.

1462
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:44,671
You're not here for revenge.

1463
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:47,557
You're here because
you're a brilliant designer

1464
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:48,929
and a wicked genius

1465
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:53,438
and you need to be among your own kind.

1466
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:55,440
Me,

1467
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:57,897
your real mother,

1468
01:57:59,155 --> 01:58:00,895
who made a mistake

1469
01:58:01,866 --> 01:58:05,984
and let something extraordinary go.

1470
01:58:08,665 --> 01:58:12,499
We are very alike, I suppose.

1471
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:20,749
Good evening,
madam, ravishing as always.

1472
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:23,885
The baroness requests
your presence outside.

1473
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:32,135
I'm sorry.

1474
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:37,776
You are?

1475
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:40,860
I am.

1476
01:58:46,536 --> 01:58:48,242
Can I hug you?

1477
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:54,036
Yes.

1478
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:13,931
You're not going to push me
off the cliff, are you?

1479
01:59:14,522 --> 01:59:16,979
You're so funny, dear.

1480
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:19,599
So funny.

1481
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,029
I love it.

1482
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:37,503
Idiot.

1483
01:59:48,223 --> 01:59:49,554
She jumped.

1484
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:51,886
Did you see? She jumped.

1485
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:59,355
She tried to drag me with her.

1486
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:01,562
She jumped, she jumped, she jumped.

1487
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:05,983
Why are you looking at me like that?

1488
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,655
Oh.

1489
02:00:09,244 --> 02:00:10,404
She jumped!

1490
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:15,322
What are you doing with those handcuffs?
She jumped!

1491
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:22,753
Cruella: So I told you I died.

1492
02:00:22,924 --> 02:00:25,085
Estella, that is.

1493
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:28,418
Poor thing.

1494
02:00:28,513 --> 02:00:31,095
She couldn't even get anyone
to come to her own funeral.

1495
02:00:34,769 --> 02:00:37,351
That seemed like an unhappy ending.

1496
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:40,814
Murdered tragically

1497
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:43,649
by her very own mother.

1498
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:44,900
Idiot.

1499
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:46,819
A few things.

1500
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:48,608
Before she dieq,

1501
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:51,112
estella willed her fortune
to her dear friend...

1502
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:52,863
Cruella de vil.

1503
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:04,871
Can't you idiots see?

1504
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:08,337
That estella person, it's a trick.

1505
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:09,671
She's really Cruella.

1506
02:01:09,846 --> 02:01:11,427
Cruella: Cruella de vil.

1507
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:16,099
It's spelled "devil,"
but it's pronounced "de vil."

1508
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:19,720
You Walt, I'll get even.

1509
02:01:20,899 --> 02:01:22,855
Cruella: The good thing
about evil people is

1510
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:27,315
you can always trust them
to do something, well,

1511
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,692
evil.

1512
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:32,069
Estella would die like her mother did.

1513
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:33,824
But not quite.

1514
02:01:39,918 --> 02:01:42,910
A well cut skirt is a lifesaver, girls.

1515
02:01:53,932 --> 02:01:57,095
She'd go to prison
for throwing someone off a cliff.

1516
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:00,097
Wrong someone,
but there's something about

1517
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:03,100
poetic justice that's just so

1518
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:06,065
poetic.

1519
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:09,443
Goodbye, estella.

1520
02:02:15,954 --> 02:02:18,036
She was with her mother now.

1521
02:02:18,206 --> 02:02:20,117
I'll take it from here.

1522
02:02:20,708 --> 02:02:23,120
But Cruella was alive.

1523
02:02:23,294 --> 02:02:25,535
All right, we should put on
some music or something.

1524
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:27,078
Lighten the mood.

1525
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:31,416
She's not actually dead, mate. She's...

1526
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:39,891
How can you not get choked up
at all this?

1527
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,016
Oh, man.

1528
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:47,895
Cruella: And I call that a happy ending.

1529
02:03:51,132 --> 02:03:53,965
Has, er, genghis put on a bit of weight?

1530
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:19,607
So, what now?

1531
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:27,623
I've got a few ideas.

1532
02:04:37,053 --> 02:04:41,296
Cruella de vil Cruella de vil

1533
02:04:41,683 --> 02:04:43,890
she's born fo be bad

1534
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:46,468
so run for the hills

1535
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:51,147
Cruella de vil Cruella de vil

1536
02:04:51,275 --> 02:04:53,516
the fear on your face

1537
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:56,235
it gives me a thrill

1538
02:04:56,739 --> 02:04:58,775
who wanis fo be nice?

1539
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:01,069
Who wanis fo be tame?

1540
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,025
All of you good guys

1541
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:05,282
y'all seem the same

1542
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,997
original, criminal

1543
02:05:08,501 --> 02:05:10,241
dressed to kill

1544
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:13,874
just call me Cruella de vil

1545
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:19,258
call me crazy, call me insane

1546
02:05:19,345 --> 02:05:21,836
but you're stuck in the past

1547
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:24,217
and I'm ahead of the game

1548
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,433
a life lived in penance

1549
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,761
it just seems a waste

1550
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:33,519
and the devil has much better taste

1551
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,359
and I tried to be sweet

1552
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:38,186
I tried to be kind

1553
02:05:38,281 --> 02:05:41,398
but I feel much better now that I'm

1554
02:05:41,492 --> 02:05:48,159
out of my mind

1555
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:55,203
oh, there always line
at the gates of hell

1556
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:58,040
but I go right to the front
'cause I dress this well

1557
02:05:58,134 --> 02:06:00,546
rip it up, leave it all in tatters

1558
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:03,423
beauty is the only thing that matters

1559
02:06:04,849 --> 02:06:10,469
the fabric of your little world is torn

1560
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:14,514
embrace the darkness

1561
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:18,268
be really blind

1562
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,646
Cruella de vil

1563
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:24,073
the fear on your face

1564
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,446
it gives me a thrill

1565
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:48,847
Roger: Hello, pongo.

1566
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:02,562
Roger: Cruella de vil

1567
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:06,199
Cruella de vil

1568
02:07:06,369 --> 02:07:09,327
if she doesn't scare you

1569
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:12,534
no evil thing will

1570
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:17,668
to see her is fo take a certain chill

1571
02:07:19,173 --> 02:07:23,291
Cruella, Cruella de vil
