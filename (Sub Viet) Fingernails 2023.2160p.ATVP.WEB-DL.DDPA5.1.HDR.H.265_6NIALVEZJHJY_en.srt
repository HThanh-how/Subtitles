1
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,516
<i>I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark</i>

2
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,403
<i>Forever's gonna start tonight</i>

3
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,738
<i>Forever's gonna start to--</i>

4
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>Once upon a time
I was falling in love</i>

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,953
<i>Now I'm only falling apart</i>

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,541
<i>There's nothing I can do</i>

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,045
<i>A total eclipse of the heart</i>

8
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,882
<i>Okay. That was
a dedication from George to Angela</i>

9
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,634
<i>after their negative result yesterday.</i>

10
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,180
<i>I'm really sorry, guys. But
you know that you are not the only ones.</i>

11
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,017
<i>And next, we're going to a dedication
from Emma to Craig.</i>

12
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:46,732
<i>And we're gonna hear from the Only Ones
the song "Why Don't You Kill Yourself?"</i>

13
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,983
<i>Okay.</i>

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,909
I was sorry to hear about
St. Leonard's closing down last month.

15
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,785
- It was such a good school.
- Yeah.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,080
Yeah, it was unexpected.

17
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,709
So you've worked mainly
in the third grade.

18
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,170
Yeah. Plus a year in the fifth
and a couple in the fourth.

19
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,850
Can I help?

20
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,648
Okay. Could you write "versatile"?

21
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,653
Versatile.

22
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,324
How'd it go?

23
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,704
Sorry. That's really personal.

24
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,707
No. It's okay.

25
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,628
It didn't go so well actually,
but it's fine.

26
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,338
I'm used to it by now.

27
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,634
What about you? Have you tested?

28
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,013
Yeah. My boyfriend and I are positive.

29
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,432
You're one of the lucky ones.

30
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,032
"And she looked at the tree
and said, 'Wow.

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,537
Those apples look so tasty.'

32
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,165
And he looked at her,
and he said, 'Yeah, they do.

33
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,959
We should eat one together.'

34
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,129
So they picked the apple off the tree,

35
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,550
split it and shared it while gazing
into each other's eyes."

36
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,510
And then this is word for word,

37
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,054
"It was peaceful in paradise,

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,516
for there were no animals around
to disturb them

39
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,810
or their love for each other."

40
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,021
That's what the poster says?

41
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,273
Yeah. It was at the principal's office.

42
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,233
Can you imagine
what they're teaching these kids?

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,985
I think that's gone too far.

44
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,447
I don't think they should
change a story that old.

45
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,451
Why? Did it even really happen?

46
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,288
I'll get it.

47
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,507
Hello?

48
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,675
Yes, this is she.

49
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,636
Yes.

50
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,347
I came by and left my CV a few times.

51
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,642
At the Love Institute?

52
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,519
Great.

53
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,689
At noon? Great.

54
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,901
Okay. Have a nice evening.

55
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,155
- Another interview?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,657
That's great. Where is it?

57
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,284
Pinewood Elementary School.

58
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,371
Is that good?

59
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,122
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

60
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:54,294
Yeah. Yeah, they have, like--
a lot of famous people studied there.

61
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,964
Really? Like who?

62
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,009
Ginger Spice.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,303
- Wow.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,181
She's my favorite.

65
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,850
I know.

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,396
Andy here is a great cook.

67
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,941
Thank you. Yeah, it's a Spanish recipe.

68
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,653
We've been trying to save up
for a vacation,

69
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,446
and we were thinking of going to Spain.

70
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,826
Carrie's been there once.
It was before she met me.

71
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:31,832
Yeah, I went to Madrid
with one of my exes,

72
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,834
a thousand years ago.

73
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,714
How did you guys meet?

74
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,632
It was at a friend's wedding.

75
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,093
We were both sitting at the singles table.

76
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:49,349
It was us, an 80-year-old fireman
and a nerdy biology student.

77
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,934
So, tough choice.

78
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,062
And how long have you been together?

79
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,108
- It's been 94 days.
- Three months.

80
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,276
Nice.

81
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,737
And have you thought
about taking the test?

82
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,410
I mean, you know my opinion.

83
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,495
We don't believe in it.

84
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,250
The whole crisis overreaction thing,
it's pretty stupid.

85
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,614
- Really good.
- Yeah, great.

86
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,327
We could take some dance classes.

87
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,538
Yeah.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,959
I gotta use the restroom.

89
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,300
Can I ask you something?

90
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,095
Have you guys taken the test?

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,847
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,976
Yeah, it was about three years ago.

93
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,060
We were positive.

94
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,478
- Nice.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,065
And how did it feel?
I mean, when you got your results.

96
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,985
Yeah, I think more than anything it felt
kind of like a relief.

97
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,029
You know, it was like
a weight had been lifted.

98
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,032
You know,
Garth doesn't believe in taking the test.

99
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,995
He says he doesn't need a certificate
to tell him if we're in love.

100
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,290
And he also thinks
losing a nail is ridiculous.

101
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,168
And you? What do you think?

102
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,546
You know, more and more
of my friends have taken it,

103
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,007
and I thought maybe we could too, but--

104
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,721
You know, Anna wanted us to go and,
go to the institute

105
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,140
just do the exercises,
you know, last summer,

106
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,309
but I thought it was
completely unnecessary.

107
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,896
You know, we had tested positive
without the extra help, and--

108
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,483
and even if sometimes
our relationship settles into routine,

109
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,611
we don't need to question that.

110
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,222
- All right. This is for you.
- Great.

111
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,307
Just fill this out,
and Duncan will be with you shortly.

112
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,018
Thank you. Excuse me.
Can I ask, is it raining?

113
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,188
No. No, they just pump that
through the entire building.

114
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,191
Rain makes people feel romantic.

115
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,903
{\an8}Yeah, it does.

116
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,823
{\an8}I keep asking them to turn it down.

117
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,992
{\an8}It just makes me need to pee.

118
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,842
<i>I often put his happiness before my own.</i>

119
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,010
When we have rib eye for dinner,

120
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,721
I know that he likes
the fatty bits of the steak.

121
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,057
So that-- Well, I cut them off mine
and give them to him

122
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,894
and pretend that I don't like them,
but actually I love them.

123
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,855
They're my favorite part.

124
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,899
And may I ask you something personal?

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,443
Do you still have strong feelings for him?

126
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,321
Yes. Yeah.

127
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,741
Yeah, I love him.

128
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,497
You do have your love certificate,
so that's not a problem, but--

129
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,251
Well, most of our recent applicants
have all been in an institute as clients.

130
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,546
So they know what it's like
to do these exercises as a couple.

131
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,132
Yeah. Well, they weren't around yet, but--

132
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,596
I really wanna learn how the exercises
help you connect more, you know?

133
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,473
And you guys, you're the best.

134
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,852
Well, it's not easy, but we try.

135
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:07,566
Now, Anna, as a teacher,
I have to ask you,

136
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,694
you wouldn't prefer to work in a school?

137
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,365
No. I really want to work here.

138
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,419
- Hey!
- Hey.

139
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,506
Made you dinner to celebrate the new job.

140
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,926
How do you know that?

141
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,345
They called a couple hours ago.

142
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,138
I said you were out,
so they left a message,

143
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,184
and the school secretary wants
to talk to you tomorrow about the details.

144
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,561
Fuck. I didn't realize
you were talking about

145
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,230
the interview the day before yesterday,

146
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,899
'cause today I went
to Pinewood Elementary School,

147
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,484
and they hired me on the spot.

148
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,153
That's great. Did you take it?

149
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,822
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

150
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,534
- Yeah.
- Great.

151
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,163
- Congratulations. Come on.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,991
Excuse me. This would not make Amir happy.

153
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,621
I was just about to say

154
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,584
that the reason they come to us is
to take the risk out of love.

155
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,169
No more uncertainty.

156
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,255
No more wondering
if you've chosen the right partner.

157
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,424
No more divorce.

158
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,051
Now, you know that five years ago,

159
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,180
the test was developed
in order to define love relationships

160
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,807
because there was concern
people weren't falling in love.

161
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,059
However, what they couldn't
have anticipated was

162
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,147
the fact that 87% of the couples
that took the test

163
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,607
received a negative result.

164
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,734
It was a staggering statistic.

165
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,361
Couples broke apart.

166
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:21,200
And people suffered a great deal.

167
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,870
And you're all aware
of the crisis that followed,

168
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,040
the insecurity that this created
in most couples.

169
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,709
And that's why I founded this institute.

170
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,504
We were the first to buy the machines
to conduct the test,

171
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:38,592
and I created the program
to make the bond of love stronger.

172
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,428
We're not here
to try to teach people to fall in love.

173
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,971
That would be insane.

174
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,183
We're here to try to bring them
closer together.

175
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,145
Now, yes,
the success rate, it's still low.

176
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,148
But thanks to this institute
and others who imitate us,

177
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,816
the numbers are slowly increasing.

178
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,986
At this point, the test,
it's more popular than ever.

179
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,864
So that shows that
people are searching for an answer,

180
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,408
even if
it's not the one they want to hear.

181
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,661
Now, I hope that,
as new employees, you'll--

182
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,663
- Sorry, I'm late.
- You'll--

183
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,415
- That's okay. Hi.
- Hey.

184
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,000
I--

185
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,337
Anyhow, what I was gonna say was,

186
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:20,759
in the past, I think we prioritized
seemingly more important things over love

187
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,219
when the truth is...

188
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,640
we're all achingly lonely.

189
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,436
And we're endlessly searching
for ways to fill that void.

190
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,524
Anyhow, each month, we change the courses

191
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,235
so the couples, they don't know
the structure of the program.

192
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,945
And Amir, one of our instructors,

193
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,949
he's been kind enough to design
and build these maquettes

194
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,994
to help illustrate
what's included in those materials,

195
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,537
if you'd like to come take a look.

196
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,340
The first one, it's--
well, it's kind of a domestic scene.

197
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,385
You'll see that when one leaves,

198
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,097
the other one may give themselves
a small electroshock

199
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,683
with the equipment
we will have provided them with.

200
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,977
The person must associate the two pains.

201
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,062
The loss of one manifests itself in--

202
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,940
in actual physical pain
for the one left behind.

203
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,650
Do you understand?

204
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,488
The second, it's kind
of a sporting scene designed by Amir.

205
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,367
Couples engage in a series
of pair-based competitive activities

206
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,828
in the hopes
that they'll be bonded together.

207
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,747
And this is one we've just talked about

208
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,916
but haven't yet
had the chance to implement.

209
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,628
We want to create
a fake fire in a movie theater,

210
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,046
where the clients are gathered.

211
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,131
Now, they'd be unaware
that it's a simulation.

212
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,468
Right now, what we do is
we have them watch romantic movies,

213
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:48,096
but with the fire,
we'd really be able to--

214
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,809
to gauge their reaction and see just how
protective they are of their other half.

215
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,772
We've also recently acquired
the rights to a compilation--

216
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,607
Alexandra?

217
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,152
Compilation of classic love songs
in their French version

218
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,655
to be used in our musical exercises.

219
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,490
If you'd queue that up, please.

220
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,689
Do you have any other questions?

221
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,276
How often do people get 50%?

222
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,488
Not a lot. Not a lot, but sometimes.

223
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,408
And those are often the hardest cases

224
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,869
when only one person is in love.

225
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,453
Especially when the machine,

226
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,915
it can't identify
which member of the couple is in love.

227
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:03,213
You see, the results,
they can range anywhere from 100% to 0%.

228
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,716
Do they ever come back to retest?

229
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,510
Sometimes.

230
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,307
But it really depends on them,
whether or when they will retest or not.

231
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,685
And one more question I've been wondering.

232
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,354
What do we do
if someone doesn't have arms?

233
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,775
To be honest...

234
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,446
well, I have no idea.

235
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,088
Yeah.

236
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,592
Hey.

237
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:51,970
Sorry.

238
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,517
- Hey.
- So, you'll be shadowing Amir.

239
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,018
He's only been here for a few months,

240
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,312
but he's already
one of our most successful instructors.

241
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,522
Great.

242
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,612
Here. We give this to all of our clients.

243
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,281
This one explains the exercise
where they need to draw one another.

244
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,160
Interesting. Can I ask you something?

245
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,246
Why are the songs in French?

246
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:25,127
<i>Il Français est
la linguage plus érotique, non?</i>

247
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,256
<i>Oui.</i>

248
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:39,852
Hi.

249
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,603
Hi.

250
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,272
- I'm Amir.
- Hi.

251
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,065
I'm Anna.

252
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,442
I'll be shadowing you this session.

253
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,527
Cool.

254
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,445
Just so you know, you're my first trainee,

255
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,197
so I'll do my best.

256
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,369
Great. Well, we're gonna be spending
our first week doing intake interviews.

257
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,497
You know, new couples.
So, I'll get the files.

258
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,707
Okay.

259
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,213
Is that your partner?

260
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,091
Natasha.

261
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,803
- You guys look great together.
- Thank you.

262
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,974
It's our two-year anniversary
in a couple of weeks.

263
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,767
How did you meet?

264
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,064
We met at a video store.

265
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,151
We both wanted to rent
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

266
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,321
There was only one copy left,
so we watched it together.

267
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,948
That's amazing.

268
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,785
No, I'm joking. No, we just met normally.

269
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,212
So you've been together for six months?

270
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,172
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,802
And you both work together
at the accounting office?

272
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,013
- Yes.
- Yes.

273
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,599
It's nice to have similar interests.

274
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,602
Accounting.

275
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,941
Okay. John, I'm gonna ask you first.

276
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,901
What's the one thing you love most
about Maria

277
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,071
that makes you certain
she is the ideal partner for you?

278
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,493
That's the first question?

279
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,162
I'm supposed to answer that now?

280
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,042
Take your time. And reply from the heart.

281
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,921
Sorry, is-- What is-- Is that--

282
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,673
Isn't it a little bit early
for that question?

283
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,508
- No, that's a--
- Well, it's just 'cause--

284
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,970
I love her hair. It's soft.

285
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,682
And her...

286
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,687
voice.

287
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,147
Yes, her voice even more.

288
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,441
It soothes me.

289
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,281
- That's a nice answer.
- It's nice.

290
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,285
Rob is also a great dancer...

291
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,164
but he never dances with me at parties.

292
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,668
He feels embarrassed
in front of other people.

293
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:16,550
But it's fun, 'cause at home he puts on
music and dances alone for hours.

294
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,635
And you, Rob?

295
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,970
I think I'm a good dancer.

296
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,929
No, h--

297
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,348
How does Sally make you feel?

298
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,561
Well, when we're together,

299
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,941
I feel as if I'm... invisible.

300
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,071
So what do you mean by that?

301
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,784
I feel like, normally,
people are always looking at me,

302
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,787
and I'm always aware of that feeling.

303
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:50,083
Outside. Apart. But I--

304
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,170
I don't have that when I'm with her.

305
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,340
I just blend into her.

306
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,264
Okay.

307
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,851
I think that's good for today.

308
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,452
Do you think they're lonely together?

309
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,708
I don't know. Or-- Maybe.

310
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,420
I know you can't really tell
from one image,

311
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,256
but I don't know,
there's just something really--

312
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,424
Should we order drinks while we wait?

313
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,385
<i>Oui. D'accord, mon amour.</i>

314
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,387
What?

315
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,222
Nothing.

316
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,351
"Spaghetti carbonara." Yum.

317
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:53,146
Actually, I wanna have
the "rib eye with caramelized onions."

318
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,356
Yes.

319
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,860
Are you sure? You always only eat half.
Why don't you go ahead and get the--

320
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,987
- Sorry for being late.
- Hey.

321
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,488
Hi.

322
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,707
What's that?

323
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,253
Andy-- We took the test again.

324
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,172
I need a drink.

325
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,467
Hey.

326
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,221
Could I have just a glass of red wine?

327
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,683
- Just make it three glasses, please.
- We'll make it a bottle.

328
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,230
It was positive.

329
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,857
Fuck you.

330
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:38,984
That's not funny.

331
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,946
- That's great. Great.
- Yeah.

332
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,406
Yeah, yeah. Congratulations.

333
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,699
Thank you.

334
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:52,331
Why did you guys
take the test again though?

335
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,708
We've been having some arguments,

336
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,544
and Andy thought it would be
a good idea to know again.

337
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,714
Even if I told him
there would be a lot of risk.

338
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,966
But I hope there's no need to do it again.

339
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,846
I really don't get it.

340
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,892
So many couples would kill
to have a positive result.

341
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,560
Why would they risk it?

342
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,941
What's that?

343
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,485
Probably nothing.

344
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,948
No. No, we should get it booked
for a service.

345
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,292
<i>With you I'm in real danger.</i>

346
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:43,298
<i>It seems like a perfect situation,
apart from that foul temper of yours,</i>

347
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:50,222
<i>but my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not recover,</i>

348
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:57,020
<i>if I was, once again, cast aside
as I would absolutely expect to be.</i>

349
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,940
<i>There are just too many
pictures of you, too many...</i>

350
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,777
<i>You know, you'd go and I'd be--</i>

351
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,989
- <i>well, buggered, basically.</i>
- Wait.

352
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,285
<i>That really is a real no, isn't it?</i>

353
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,956
<i>I live in Notting Hill.
You live in Beverly Hills.</i>

354
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:21,211
<i>Everyone in the world knows who you are.
My mother has trouble remembering my name.</i>

355
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,339
<i>Fine.</i>

356
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,355
The fire was such a good idea.

357
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,649
Yeah, the cinema owner got cold feet.

358
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,235
It wasn't even that dangerous.
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

359
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,987
We've always had movies in the program.

360
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,323
Duncan thinks it's crucial.
I just don't see it.

361
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,908
Everything's too simple in films.

362
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,285
Besides, watching a love story feels safe.

363
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,703
Being in love doesn't.

364
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:00,417
No, I prefer doing exercises
based on the movies, you know?

365
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,461
Like <i>Titanic</i>?

366
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,798
Do you like romantic movies?

367
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,052
Nah, I like horrors.

368
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,934
That's all right.
Yeah. Don't worry if you're tired.

369
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,937
Can watch a movie at home. Okay.

370
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:23,023
I'll see you later. Bye. Love you, bye.

371
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,369
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

372
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,328
Are you leaving?

373
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,997
I'm just going. Sorry.

374
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:40,749
- Oh, Anna?
- Yeah?

375
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,126
Y-- Really great job this week.

376
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,587
Thank you.

377
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,673
- Okay.
- Bye.

378
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,757
Bye.

379
00:25:55,264 --> 00:26:00,185
<i>Each year, caribou undertake
a long and perilous journey,</i>

380
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:04,523
<i>migrating from their wintering grounds
to their summering grounds.</i>

381
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,775
<i>The journey begins in winter</i>

382
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,571
<i>when the caribou leave their
wintering grounds in the boreal forest.</i>

383
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,073
<i>They travel south,</i>

384
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:17,703
<i>following the snowmelt, until they reach
their summering grounds in the tundra.</i>

385
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,622
These things always make me cry.

386
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,165
<i>...a thousand miles long.</i>

387
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,794
<i>And it takes the caribou
several months to complete.</i>

388
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:26,879
Can I--

389
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:31,258
I'm running an art project at school where
everyone draws a member of their family.

390
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:32,926
That's nice.

391
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:35,554
Can I draw you?

392
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,807
- Really?
- Yeah.

393
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,559
It'll be fun.

394
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,520
You mean, like, now?

395
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,523
Yeah. You don't have to do anything.

396
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,360
I can keep watching the documentary?

397
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,071
I really wanna see what happens
to the caribou.

398
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,282
That's fine. I'm gonna get my things.

399
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,077
<i>And their hooves are sharp and pointed.</i>

400
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:09,379
<i>It is a reminder that even in the harshest
of environments, life can thrive.</i>

401
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,800
<i>The caribou's journey is also important
for the arctic ecosystem.</i>

402
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,095
- Do you wanna draw me after?
- <i>The caribou are a keystone species.</i>

403
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,639
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,100
Why?

405
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,770
<i>...source for many other animals.</i>

406
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,773
I don't know. It'd be nice.

407
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,401
That's part of the project or...

408
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,530
No. Don't worry.

409
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,015
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

410
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,600
Did you want milk and sugar?

411
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,726
No, it's okay.

412
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,228
It has both.

413
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,190
Excuse me. Sorry to bother.

414
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,235
I just had a question.
Is this task based on a movie?

415
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,862
It reminds me of something.

416
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,071
It is.

417
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,365
It's based on the opening scene
of a movie named <i>Jaws</i>.

418
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,449
Heard of it?

419
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,744
I'm joking. It's--
I don't think it's based on a movie.

420
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,038
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,924
They seem so good together.

422
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,306
I don't know. I-- Maybe--

423
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,057
I think they've got something real.

424
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,227
Don't get too carried away.

425
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,273
You know, it's difficult to make
your first big love last. People change.

426
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,942
I know. They're only 21.

427
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,821
You never know.

428
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,908
I mean, it's possible
for people to change together.

429
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,120
- I think it's time to start.
- Okay.

430
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,293
Okay. As I told you, main thing
to watch out for is, are their eyes open?

431
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,379
And then how much are they moving around?
How much are they still?

432
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,714
Basically, have they drowned?

433
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,759
Ideally, we don't want anyone dying on us. Again.

434
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:22,888
Yeah.

435
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,568
Remember, the aim is to hold eye contact
underwater for one minute.

436
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,656
Okay? Three, two, one. Let's go.

437
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,283
- Hi.
- Hey.

438
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,659
- You okay?
- Yeah.

439
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,786
This is just stuck.

440
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,874
Let me help you.

441
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,417
Thank you.

442
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,003
All right. One, two...

443
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,839
Oh, my God, it really is stuck.

444
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,640
God, it really--

445
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,475
Sorry.

446
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,604
I actually think it looks cooler
like that.

447
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:54,980
- Yeah.
- I might leave it.

448
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,734
Yeah. It looks great.

449
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,405
Yeah, I'll just take it
to the garage tomorrow. Thank you.

450
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,199
Okay.

451
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,368
- Okay, bye. See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

452
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,123
Bye.

453
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,188
Ryan?

454
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,386
Okay, Rob.

455
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,570
Sally, step back.

456
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,114
And let's go.

457
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,169
Okay.

458
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,886
Two, three. Okay.

459
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,471
Go.

460
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:57,644
- Oh, God.
- Easy. Easy there.

461
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,272
Gently, please. Sorry about that.

462
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:28,050
Rob, that's a wall.
Yeah, everybody's kind of back this way.

463
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:48,070
No t-- No touching, Rob.
No touching. Thank you.

464
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,505
I think I found her.

465
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,675
Let's find out. Take off that blindfold.

466
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,637
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

467
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,138
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

468
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,806
What was that?

469
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:20,268
It means "wonderful." It's--

470
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,271
What? Okay, I haven't heard that before.

471
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,982
Okay. Thank you, everyone.
Well done, and let's take a break.

472
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:30,362
- Can I try something? I've got an idea.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

473
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:31,947
That was really great.

474
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,116
I know we asked you not to shower
for a few days

475
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,951
in preparation for this exercise,

476
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:39,580
but I was wondering maybe if you wanted
to try and take a shower together?

477
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,208
It can be very intimate
to wash each other's bodies.

478
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,503
It might help deepen your connection.

479
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,964
Okay.

480
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we'll do it.

481
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,802
- Okay. Good work.
- Great. Great.

482
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,679
Thank you.

483
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,769
That is a really good idea.

484
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:04,646
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

485
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,816
Yeah. Really, really... It's great.

486
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,237
Seriously.

487
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,365
Thank you.

488
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,203
Yeah, well, it's-- I don't-- It's--

489
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:21,121
Ryan and I bathe together all the time.

490
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,539
- Yeah.
- Right.

491
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,541
Don't-- you and Natasha?

492
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:30,255
I think it could help them
deepen their connection.

493
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,634
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
- You know? That's what you said.

494
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,065
Fuck.

495
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:55,489
F--

496
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,505
- You want a coffee before you go?
- No, thank you.

497
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,466
Hey, how are you gonna get in today?

498
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,511
- Taking the bus is really easy.
- Yeah?

499
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,388
Straight to the school gates.

500
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,098
That's great.

501
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,105
Hey, have you met any kids
you think could become famous yet?

502
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,110
Yeah.

503
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,113
There's a boy
who's very good at Ping-Pong.

504
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,574
- Ping-Pong?
- Yeah.

505
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,910
Are there any famous Ping-Pong players?

506
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,995
Yeah.

507
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:44,788
Yeah?

508
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,917
No. I d-- Let me think.

509
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,129
I mean, there's gotta be
someone famous in Ping-Pong.

510
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,463
Right?

511
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,217
You look really nice today.

512
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,302
Really?

513
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,555
I mean, these pants don't really fit.

514
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,433
I think they...

515
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,354
I think they make your butt
look really nice.

516
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,106
Really?

517
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,484
I think it looks normal.

518
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,743
How would you feel
about being a little late to work?

519
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:27,581
I have a team meeting first thing.
I'm sorry.

520
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,498
Okay.

521
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:30,876
Hey.

522
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,088
I'll see you, okay?

523
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,592
- Love you.
- Love you too.

524
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,769
Bye.

525
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:16,839
Fuck!

526
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,846
Oh, fuck.

527
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:27,683
Oh, my God.

528
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,077
- Ouch.
- Here you go.

529
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,245
Thank you.

530
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,206
It's the one-year anniversary
of the institute today.

531
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,458
So, I thought we'd have
a party here Saturday.

532
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,294
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

533
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:58,297
I know it's short notice,
but I hope you can be there.

534
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,842
I usually spend the weekends with Ryan.

535
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,553
Great. Bring him along.
I'd love to meet him.

536
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,930
Well, he's actually
at a conference this weekend, so--

537
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,849
Yeah. And I'm going with him, you know.

538
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,934
Trying to be a supportive partner.

539
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,895
Well, that's nice.

540
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,147
Thank you.

541
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,481
You're welcome.

542
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,775
- I-- Yeah, I better go.
- Okay.

543
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,485
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Bye.

544
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,596
Sorry.

545
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:49,932
- Duncan held me up.
- It's all right.

546
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,394
At least they seem
to be enjoying the singing.

547
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,146
Yeah.

548
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,989
Can I ask you something?

549
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,741
What?

550
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,160
Do you know any famous Ping-Pong players?

551
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:13,413
Not personally.

552
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:18,794
No. I mean what about Forrest Gump?

553
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,881
- Forrest fucking Gump.
- Does that count?

554
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,259
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

555
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,141
Did Duncan tell you
about the reallocation?

556
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,312
No, he just told me about the party.

557
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:43,068
Well, he's had an idea.
Thinks that we should specialize more.

558
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,656
So he wants each instructor
to be an expert on a particular age group.

559
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,825
We're gonna be handling couples
in their 30s.

560
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:57,875
What about Rob and Sally?

561
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,294
- What about them?
- Well, we won't work with them anymore?

562
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,503
No.

563
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,713
Fuck.

564
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,175
I thought they had a really good chance.

565
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:10,012
I mean, I thought we were
doing really good work with them.

566
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:14,141
I agree, but Duncan's made up his mind.

567
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,601
Be too complicated now.

568
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:18,478
I'm sorry.

569
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,213
Feels very sticky.

570
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:02,189
Why are we doing this?

571
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,905
I don't know. I thought it'd be fun.

572
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:13,909
No. It's okay.
It's just messy. That's all.

573
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,206
I don't like it. I'm sorry.

574
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,216
Fuck.

575
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,844
It's horrible.

576
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,936
- Should we wait for it to stop?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:52,865
Are you okay?

578
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,951
Yeah.

579
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:01,039
Excuse me.

580
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,549
I need to tell you something.

581
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:11,967
I...

582
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,181
I haven't been very honest
with you recently.

583
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,601
I didn't take the job at the school.

584
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:24,229
I've been--

585
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,233
I've been working at the
Love Training Institute downtown.

586
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,990
Why didn't you tell me that?

587
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,455
I don't know. I didn't wanna worry you.

588
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,666
Why would that worry me?

589
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,836
I don't know. I was stupid.

590
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,797
I thought if I told you, you would think
there was something wrong with us.

591
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,133
I don't know-- It was stupid.

592
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:55,886
Okay.

593
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,850
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I should've.

594
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:18,492
Don't you wanna say anything?

595
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm gonna take a shower.

596
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,061
Do you wanna go first?

597
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,189
No. I'm gonna watch some TV.

598
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,149
Okay.

599
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,601
- Hey.
- Hey.

600
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,395
- Come in?
- Yeah.

601
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:46,872
Did you lie to me because
that training program is nonsense?

602
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:50,667
Yes.

603
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,377
Yeah?

604
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:53,795
Well, I thought if I told you,

605
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,507
you would encourage me
to take the job at school instead.

606
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:58,634
I wouldn't do that.

607
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:05,974
I know.
I just really wanted to work there.

608
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,519
I understand that, but it still is--

609
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,815
- Anna, that's fucking serious.
- I know.

610
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:26,286
Have you ever hidden anything from me?

611
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,584
Nina Simone bores me to death,

612
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,671
but I listen to her songs
because I know you like them.

613
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,174
Okay.

614
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:45,180
Hey, there's a party
at the office on Saturday.

615
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,266
I told them I couldn't make it,

616
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:51,311
but if you want to, we could go together.

617
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:55,440
It'll be nice for you to see where I work.

618
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:58,944
- You wanna go in?
- Yeah.

619
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:29,975
<i>Only you</i>

620
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:38,775
<i>Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game</i>

621
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,696
<i>And I need you</i>

622
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:46,241
<i>Listen to the words that I say</i>

623
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,369
<i>It's getting harder to stay</i>

624
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:53,457
<i>When I see you</i>

625
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:58,212
<i>All I needed was the love you gave</i>

626
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,674
<i>All I needed was another way</i>

627
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:08,430
<i>And all I ever knew
Only you</i>

628
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:13,727
We're ready.

629
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,522
Okay.

630
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,157
So, I--

631
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,744
I clamp down and pull?

632
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,330
Yeah. Just press down hard.

633
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,749
When you pull, you pull out, not up.

634
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:37,417
Okay. Yeah.

635
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,545
This. Not this.

636
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:40,879
Exactly.

637
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,923
You'll be great.
You've got very steady hands.

638
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:44,842
Thank you.

639
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:46,343
- We're ready.
- Yeah.

640
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,220
- Okay. Could you grab that?
- Yeah.

641
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,388
Thanks.

642
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:53,642
Okay.

643
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,396
Okay. So, you know how the test works?

644
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:58,730
- Yes.
- Yes.

645
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,857
So, how you feeling?

646
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,025
I think we're feeling pretty confident

647
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:04,194
- after all those exercises.
- Great.

648
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:06,572
We have been having sex
every night this week

649
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,574
for at least an hour each time.

650
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:12,160
Lucky you.
Well, this will be quicker than that.

651
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:14,371
Shall we?

652
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,249
Here you go.

653
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,586
They usually don't scream
if you wanna-- No.

654
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,088
- Okay. You're gonna bite down.
- You ready?

655
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:26,592
- Great. Okay, just bite down on that.
- Thank you.

656
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,386
Have you chosen which nail?

657
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,388
- Yeah.
- That's a good nail.

658
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,227
Ready?

659
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:40,105
Okay. Three, two, one.

660
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,200
It'll pass.

661
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,869
- Happens every day. Okay?
- You're doing great.

662
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,497
You're doing great.

663
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,710
Okay. Let me have a look at that.

664
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,545
- That looks fine.
- Keep your fingers straight.

665
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,630
You're doing good.

666
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:04,982
Do you want some?

667
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,150
Thanks. I can't.

668
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,363
I'm gluten intolerant. Yeah.

669
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:13,657
So, if I have any, I'll die in pain.

670
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,909
- Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
- It's okay.

671
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:19,454
It means it's--
I have to eat more healthily, and--

672
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:22,082
I mean, I miss the taste
of some things, but it's fine.

673
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:24,835
Yeah.

674
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,809
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

675
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,771
To what?

676
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,773
To all the zero percents.

677
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,485
Did you think they would get
a positive result?

678
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,700
No. No, not at all, really.

679
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:00,162
You know, but even when
you know they're not going to get there,

680
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:01,622
at least they're trying.

681
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,417
And it gets worse than that.

682
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:08,337
The worst is when you think
they're perfect for each other and still...

683
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,843
Look, I know you're sad
because we've lost Rob and Sally too,

684
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:19,473
but I promise you, next time,
we'll nail it.

685
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,000
This is my girlfriend, Gina.

686
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,002
- Hi. Ryan. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi. Anna.

687
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,004
- Thank you so much for coming tonight.
- Of course.

688
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:54,174
- It's a pretty exciting evening. One year.
- You look amazing.

689
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,180
I know, right?

690
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:03,100
Now, I understand you're in sales?

691
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,060
- Hey, everyone. Hey. This is Natasha.
- Hi.

692
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,939
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

693
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:11,316
- Hi. Hey. Ryan. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

694
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:13,652
- I'm with Anna. Yeah.
- Hi, there. Duncan. Nice to meet you.

695
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:14,820
- Hey.
- Hey. Ryan.

696
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,280
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

697
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,948
- Hey. Nice to meet you. Ryan.
- Ryan?

698
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,074
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

699
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,450
I've heard a lot about you.

700
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,869
- Yeah?
- From Anna. Yeah.

701
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,704
We've been working together, haven't we?

702
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:25,622
- Last few weeks.
- We have.

703
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,416
Sorry, your name was...

704
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,876
- Amir.
- Amir. Right.

705
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:30,669
No, I've heard about you too. Yeah.

706
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,713
- Cool.
- Nice.

707
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:35,507
- Oh, yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

708
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:37,801
It's been very exciting
having him on the team, so...

709
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,803
Congratulations. I just wanted to say.

710
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,013
- Yeah, I mean...
- Thank you.

711
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,934
Hey, I spoke to Duncan,
and we can keep Sally and Rob.

712
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,227
- What?
- Yeah.

713
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,606
That's amazing.

714
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,776
- Yes.
- Thought you'd like it.

715
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:03,387
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

716
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,806
Are you enjoying the party?

717
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:07,224
Yeah, everyone's so nice.

718
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,518
Well, you and Amir are such great dancers.

719
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,770
Well, we have fun.

720
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,525
- Can I get you a slice?
- Yes, please.

721
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,987
And one for Amir too, if you don't mind.
Thank you.

722
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,200
I think it might have gluten.

723
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:27,744
Why is that a problem?

724
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:32,958
Well, I mean,
Amir will die from pain if he eats gluten.

725
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:35,002
His allergy?

726
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,755
Right. That's right.

727
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,049
He is gluten-free. I just-- I forgot. So...

728
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,968
- Don't tell him I forgot.
- No.

729
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,596
- So just-- I'll take the one. Thank you.
- The one?

730
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,690
Great. Great. Thank you.

731
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,942
See you out there.

732
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:33,495
- Hey.
- Hi.

733
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,873
I'm just gonna go grab some beers.
We're all out.

734
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,624
You leaving?

735
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,418
Yeah.

736
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:42,504
Ryan, he forgot his scarf.
He's just gone inside.

737
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:46,049
All right. I'll wait with you.

738
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,384
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

739
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,974
Where's Natasha?

740
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:56,685
She's gone home. Yeah. Early start.

741
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:12,242
What?

742
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,121
Sorry.

743
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:19,458
Sorry, I was just-- I was thinking.

744
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,085
Yeah.

745
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:28,967
What's the purpose
of the underwater exercise?

746
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,512
You know, with the staring?

747
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,347
I knew it.
You never looked at the materials.

748
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:34,890
I could tell.

749
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,267
- Just making it all up as you went along.
- Yes, I did.

750
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:41,813
It's supposed to simulate
the feeling of breathlessness.

751
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,067
And the action of staring
into each other's eyes.

752
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,611
It can create-- I don't know-- intimacy.

753
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,825
It's a nice idea. They all are.

754
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:56,036
I mean, once you're reminded of it

755
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,789
you realize how little any of us
look each other in the eyes anymore.

756
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,293
Yeah.

757
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,797
We're so fucking stupid.

758
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,677
- Well, not you. Well, not just you.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

759
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,930
And I am fucking stupid.

760
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:31,071
- Hey.
- Hi.

761
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:33,031
- Got it.
- Great.

762
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,409
- You set? Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

763
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,119
Hey, man, so nice meeting you.

764
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,371
Have a good night.

765
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,290
- See ya.
- Night.

766
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,345
What time
did the party finish on Saturday?

767
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,096
Next.

768
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,806
About 5:00 a.m.

769
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:41,975
I liked your dancing.

770
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:45,729
Thank you.

771
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:55,531
How are you two doing?

772
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:59,076
I'm excited! I've never done this before!

773
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:03,038
I'm a bit scared,
but we'll do it together.

774
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,169
Yeah!

775
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,171
All right, it's our turn now.

776
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,632
- Yeah, we can do this. Okay?
- No. I--

777
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:16,343
- I can't-- No, I can't do this.
- We got this.

778
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:19,179
- We can do this.
- I can't-- I can't fucking do this.

779
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,347
Is everything okay?

780
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:24,935
We were just wondering
if this exercise is really necessary.

781
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:28,480
Well, we have found that the adrenaline,

782
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,109
you know, and having your lives in
each other's hands, it's pretty effective.

783
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:35,237
It's just that my partner, Andrew,

784
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:37,698
he just told me that
he has a deathly fear of heights.

785
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,658
It's, like, deathly.

786
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:44,955
What if we go with,
like, an instructor or someone?

787
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,668
What if one of you
falls in love with the instructor?

788
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:57,217
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to, okay?

789
01:01:57,217 --> 01:01:59,052
Just have a seat.
We'll work it out for later.

790
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,137
Thank you.

791
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,056
Next.

792
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,229
- You good? All right.
- I'm good.

793
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:11,815
Don't forget to pull the cord, okay?

794
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:12,900
- Okay.
- Yeah.

795
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:46,558
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

796
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,528
Look out. Watch out.

797
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,700
- We'll be right there!
- Hello?

798
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,370
We're here. Over here.

799
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,436
You think this red light's
gonna last forever?

800
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,442
Do you have a change of clothes
at the office?

801
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:39,862
Yeah, I'm wearing it.

802
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:44,491
Well, do you wanna go by your place
and pick up some? I don't mind.

803
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:50,581
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll be quick.

804
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:05,804
All right. I'll be quick.

805
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:07,472
Do you mind if I come up?

806
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,183
I'll be two minutes.

807
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:12,811
Oh, yeah.
Just to wash the mud off my hands.

808
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:15,105
- Right.
- Unless I'll bother Natasha.

809
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,274
Oh, no. Nat--

810
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:19,860
Natasha's at work. It's just messy.

811
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:23,697
I haven't had a chance to--
You know. It's gross.

812
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,658
Oh, yeah. Okay. No, I'll stay here.

813
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:31,663
You know what? Come up.

814
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:33,582
Yeah?

815
01:04:33,582 --> 01:04:36,710
Yeah, I'll make you a coffee.

816
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:39,796
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

817
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:21,964
Hey.

818
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,425
You can sit here.

819
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:26,510
Yeah.

820
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,637
And this is for you.

821
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,641
Yeah. And...

822
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,061
if you get bored,

823
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:39,064
then this is...

824
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:43,026
interesting.

825
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:48,490
Okay. Yeah. Quick read.

826
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:50,284
Yeah.

827
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:53,954
I'll be quick.

828
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:20,624
Anna.

829
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:24,878
Yeah?

830
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:35,389
Nothing.

831
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:42,646
- I'll just be ready in a minute.
- Okay.

832
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:44,917
- Anna.
- You okay?

833
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,462
I don't wanna lose him.

834
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:51,798
Don't worry, Sally.

835
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,594
But what if it's--
I mean, what do we do then?

836
01:08:55,594 --> 01:08:58,221
Hey, it's gonna be fine. Okay?

837
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:00,682
Why don't you sit down?

838
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:03,393
Here, take a seat.

839
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:06,188
I don't think I like this.

840
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:08,148
That's okay. Don't worry.

841
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,901
No, I really don't like this.

842
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:14,571
Rob, it's just a brief, little
moment of pain, and then it's done. Okay?

843
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,323
I don't wanna do it.

844
01:09:17,323 --> 01:09:18,783
Okay. Hey.

845
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,332
Close your eyes.

846
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,919
Open your mouth. Bite down. Okay?

847
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,173
I'm not doing it.

848
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,091
Rob. Rob, look at me.

849
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:39,263
It's gonna be okay.
We've waited a long time to do this.

850
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:42,515
I'm sorry, Sally.
I'm just fucking freaking out.

851
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,268
You know how I feel about blood.

852
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,770
There's really not a lot of blood.

853
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:50,607
Look, I'm scared too.
But it'll be quick. Right?

854
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,234
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

855
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:53,819
Look, you guys have been so nice to us,

856
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,113
- but I'm not in the right place for this.
- Rob, look at me.

857
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,407
Look at me. Listen, I know you're afraid.

858
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,367
And more than that,
I know you feel vulnerable.

859
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:02,744
I know exactly how that feels.

860
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:06,290
I've done this before.

861
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:08,625
It's not as bad as you think.

862
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,335
- Look at it. Look.
- I don't care.

863
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,173
You don't have to do it right now.
I have to. Not you.

864
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:18,218
Rob, look-- Just sit down and do it.
I want you to do this.

865
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:20,470
Sally,
do you realize this is a form of torture?

866
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,223
- My God. You really--
- What do you think?

867
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:27,186
I just didn't expect him
to behave like that.

868
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:30,147
Why did we do all these exercises?
Just sit down.

869
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:32,482
- Look, I'm--
- Just sit down and do it.

870
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:33,942
Do you think they're gonna leave?

871
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:35,485
Sally, you realize this
is a form of punishment?

872
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:36,570
I'll do it.

873
01:10:37,571 --> 01:10:38,572
What?

874
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,283
I'll do it.

875
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:43,744
- Please, Rob--
- Just-- Come on.

876
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:46,455
- Rob, look at me. It's not that bad.
- We can go right now. Please.

877
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:48,916
I'm gonna show you. Okay?

878
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,711
If I do it, will you do it?

879
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:54,213
- Are you doing it?
- What?

880
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,298
If I do it, will you do it?

881
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:58,175
Wh-- I mean--

882
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:00,677
I don't know. I mean...

883
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:03,680
maybe.

884
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:08,894
Okay. Then I'm gonna do it,
and you're gonna see it's not that bad.

885
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:12,064
And-- But then it's your turn.

886
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:16,527
Okay.

887
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:21,198
- No. Whoa. What are you doing?
- Okay. Okay.

888
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:23,408
We can just reschedule.
This isn't a big deal.

889
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:24,618
We can just reschedule.

890
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:31,917
Oh, my God.

891
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:34,962
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

892
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,463
Oh, my God.

893
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:39,049
It's just a little scratch.

894
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,136
Just a little scratch.

895
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,264
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

896
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,142
- Okay. You're up next.
- You're gonna do it, right, Rob?

897
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,980
- Look up there.
- No, no. It's all right.

898
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:57,526
You think you can do it?
You're gonna do it, Rob?

899
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:58,610
Thank you.

900
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:04,491
Hey, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

901
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:05,659
I'll be okay.

902
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,513
- You did really well.
- Thank you.

903
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:29,558
- We're almost... Done.
- Hey. You did great.

904
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:30,642
Thank you.

905
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,395
Okay. Coming back soon.

906
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:35,147
Yeah.

907
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:06,970
Thank you.

908
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,868
Can you just take one step to your left?

909
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,372
Yeah-- Split the difference.

910
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:35,999
- Yeah, perfect.
- Okay.

911
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:44,299
Well, congratulations.

912
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,094
- Thank you.
- Well done. Of course.

913
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:49,555
- Thank you.
- Good job.

914
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:57,813
{\an8}Okay, great. If I could just
get you looking here, please.

915
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,399
Perfect. Okay.

916
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,985
We'll do one more.
Just gonna make a slight adjustment here.

917
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,070
{\an8}Thank you for your patience.

918
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,865
{\an8}Looks great. Looks great.

919
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:09,783
{\an8}Okay, ready?

920
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:36,930
- Hi.
- Hey.

921
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:45,314
How was your day?

922
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:46,940
Difficult.

923
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,442
Why? What happened?

924
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,776
It was Ronan again.

925
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,405
He came in completely unprepared and--

926
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:57,451
I don't know, he just made me
look like an idiot in the presentation.

927
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,038
What happened?

928
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:05,709
I tripped in the street
and sprained my fingers.

929
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:07,461
Did you go to the hospital?

930
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,296
No. It's fine. It's just in case.

931
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:12,007
- You sure?
- It's fine. Yeah. Are you hungry?

932
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:14,218
Yeah. Starving.

933
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:18,639
Do you want some leftovers from yesterday?

934
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:19,723
Sure.

935
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,227
You sure you're okay?

936
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:25,479
Yeah.

937
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,373
Hi. Is Duncan busy?

938
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,083
- No. Go ahead.
- Okay. Great.

939
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:51,338
Do you have a moment?

940
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,422
Of course.

941
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:58,929
What's the--

942
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:04,685
I was with my son, Milo, yesterday,

943
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,520
and we were playing with these.

944
01:18:07,771 --> 01:18:09,940
He made them fly through space.

945
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:12,985
Then he was trying to make them kiss.

946
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:16,572
I didn't know you had a son.

947
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:20,284
I do. He's nine now. A great kid.

948
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:22,369
He's from my previous marriage.

949
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:25,247
His mother and I divorced three years ago.

950
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,499
We had a negative test.

951
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:31,211
And-- Well, that's why
we're no longer together.

952
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:37,217
Anyhow. What can I help you with?

953
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:40,929
I was wondering if it was possible that

954
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:43,390
one person could be in love--

955
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:47,519
I mean, have a positive result
with two people at the same time?

956
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,397
Yeah. Sadly, it's not possible.

957
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:52,065
It'd be like--

958
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:54,860
It'd be like a six-months-pregnant woman

959
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,362
suddenly becoming pregnant
with another child.

960
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:59,573
Biological impossibility.

961
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:02,409
Yeah. That's what I thought too, yeah.

962
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,457
So, he's singing about his mother?

963
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:13,212
No. "<i>La mer</i>" means "the sea."
So, he's singing about the sea.

964
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:15,130
Which sea?

965
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:19,718
Good question.

966
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,637
Not any particular sea.

967
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:25,766
But just more the sea in general.

968
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:28,977
All the seas?

969
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:35,442
You know, it's more like-- more--

970
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,946
more the sea as a kind of idea.

971
01:19:39,863 --> 01:19:41,615
You know? And the idea is...

972
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:47,162
It's love.

973
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:50,290
Yeah, the sea is love.

974
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:53,627
And what about the rest of the lyrics?

975
01:19:56,505 --> 01:20:01,051
He's singing
about white sheep and white birds

976
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:05,180
and angels and little, rusted houses.
It's--

977
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:09,268
- And how is any of that romantic?
- It just is. It's--

978
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,312
There's a feeling that just--

979
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:17,484
The music is very romantic.
It almost doesn't matter what he's saying.

980
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:19,862
Should I sing now?

981
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:21,864
Please.

982
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:19,922
- Oh, shit.
- Not again.

983
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:30,641
Okay, wait.

984
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,100
I think it's--

985
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:37,856
- Take it.
- Can I?

986
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:20,983
Thanks for the lift.

987
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:23,569
No worries. Try not to hurt yourself.

988
01:22:24,278 --> 01:22:25,279
Yeah, I'll try.

989
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:27,698
Can I ask you something?

990
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:31,243
Why do you work at the institute?

991
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:36,874
- I mean--
- I like pulling out people's fingernails.

992
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,502
What? I'm trying to open up here.

993
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:48,886
I just wanted to be there. You know?

994
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,848
Maybe understand love a little better.
Thought I did.

995
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,810
But I don-- Lately--

996
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,273
Especially lately, I'm not so sure.

997
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:04,985
Yeah.

998
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,116
Thanks.

999
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:13,744
You're welcome.

1000
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:17,289
I'll see you tomorrow.

1001
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:19,625
See you tomorrow.

1002
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,770
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>

1003
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:43,190
<i>what holds the planets
in orbit around the sun?</i>

1004
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:48,028
<i>Or what keeps us
from floating off into space?</i>

1005
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:51,156
<i>The answer is gravity.</i>

1006
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:55,160
You remember
it's Carrie's birthday tomorrow?

1007
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,162
Yeah. I got her a present yesterday.

1008
01:23:58,664 --> 01:24:00,207
I didn't see it. What did you get?

1009
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,793
Sorry. I forgot to tell you. An album.

1010
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:04,336
Which one?

1011
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:06,380
<i>The Best of Nina Simone</i>.

1012
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,259
I hope you got the gift receipt.

1013
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,847
I think it's kind of cool
that they retook the test. Don't you?

1014
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:19,685
I was thinking since I work there
and get a discount,

1015
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:22,479
that we could take advantage
of it and do it again.

1016
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:26,942
Yeah. You know, just for fun.

1017
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,781
No way. That's not my idea of fun,
having my fingernails ripped out.

1018
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:34,825
I know, it's just--

1019
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,537
You know, the institute has got
such a good reputation,

1020
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:39,663
and with the discount--

1021
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:42,416
Yeah, we've already passed the test.
Why would we take it again?

1022
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:45,335
Well, 'cause, like,
Carrie and Andy took it.

1023
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:47,129
I don't care what other people do.

1024
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:49,840
<i>...that we still don't fully understand.</i>

1025
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,594
<i>But it's one of the most important forces
in the universe.</i>

1026
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:55,387
<i>And it's what makes life</i>

1027
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:57,014
<i>on Earth possible.</i>

1028
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,935
- <i>Without gravity the planet...</i>
- Do you think that we should...

1029
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:03,645
<i>...would fly off into space.</i>

1030
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:06,190
...do it? To retake the test?

1031
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,109
And have your feelings changed?

1032
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:12,237
No.

1033
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,327
Yeah, 'cause my feelings haven't changed.

1034
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:24,750
You know, if anything, I feel like
my feelings have only gotten stronger.

1035
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,668
- Yeah, but it's not about that.
- What's it about?

1036
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:27,753
It's--

1037
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,758
I don't know. It's--

1038
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:40,307
I don't wanna have this conversation.

1039
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,901
I'm sorry, what do you want?

1040
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:56,240
Yeah, I think it's normal to get
into a bit of a routine.

1041
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,368
Right? I think
that's the nature of a relationship.

1042
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:01,078
You can't take it for granted.

1043
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,250
I think a relationship should be worked on
every day. All the time.

1044
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,334
Okay.

1045
01:26:09,795 --> 01:26:10,796
And?

1046
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:15,133
Nothing. Forget it.

1047
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:57,342
Why aren't you sleeping?

1048
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:03,098
Can't sleep.

1049
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,858
Okay. Let's go and do it now.

1050
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,197
What? Now?

1051
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:19,698
Yeah.

1052
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:56,360
Do you wanna come
and see the results together?

1053
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:30,853
I don't know
how I'm gonna explain this at work.

1054
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,523
It was positive.

1055
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:37,776
Why do you need to explain it?

1056
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:44,700
We're never doing this again.

1057
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:48,579
Yeah.

1058
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:09,725
Morning.

1059
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:13,729
Amir. I--

1060
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:17,441
I need to talk to you about something.

1061
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,028
I--

1062
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:24,156
I--

1063
01:29:25,324 --> 01:29:28,911
Hi, excuse me.
So, Marcus, he's out sick today.

1064
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:31,288
But he had two clients
that were due for testing right now.

1065
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:34,124
Would you two mind stepping in?
I'm sorry for the late notice.

1066
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,876
Yeah. Sure.

1067
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:38,086
Yeah, it's fi-- I don't think
we have any tests booked this morning.

1068
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:40,964
Great. There's his file.
Just take a quick look at it.

1069
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:42,257
Thank you.

1070
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:48,138
What were you gonna say?

1071
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:51,099
Nothing.

1072
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:00,150
Okay.

1073
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:02,528
I'll go set up the tests.

1074
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:04,112
Okay.

1075
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:40,899
Amir, would you mind
taking a look at something?

1076
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,402
- Sure.
- What? Is everything okay?

1077
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:44,736
Yeah.

1078
01:30:44,736 --> 01:30:46,905
I think there's
something wrong with the machine.

1079
01:30:48,323 --> 01:30:49,324
Won't be a minute.

1080
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,457
There was a strange sound,
and then it just stopped.

1081
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:59,376
Oh, shit.

1082
01:31:05,883 --> 01:31:07,092
Shit.

1083
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,095
Okay.

1084
01:31:17,603 --> 01:31:18,604
Okay.

1085
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:28,113
Okay, what are we gonna tell 'em?

1086
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:39,541
I need to tell you something.

1087
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:41,877
What?

1088
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,378
I tested our fingernails.

1089
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,842
What? Wait, whose fingernails?

1090
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:51,178
Ours.

1091
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:55,182
What do-- How did--

1092
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:02,439
Look, I know you're not with Natasha.

1093
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:05,984
She doesn't know anything about you.

1094
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:12,908
She's my neighbor.

1095
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:16,537
What were the results?

1096
01:32:17,538 --> 01:32:18,622
Fifty percent.

1097
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:23,669
So I...

1098
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:31,718
I retested with Ryan last night
and it was 100%.

1099
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:37,266
Excuse me? Is everything okay in there?

1100
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:46,817
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know what it means.

1101
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:52,447
I mean, maybe that-- I don't know.
Maybe that you're in--

1102
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:57,494
you're in love with me, and...

1103
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:00,914
I'm not in love with you.

1104
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:03,709
Hello?

1105
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:13,844
Yeah, I think it does.

1106
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:20,392
I just gotta--

1107
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:43,123
Thanks. Okay.

1108
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:48,629
- Take care. All right.
- Thanks.

1109
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:49,671
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1110
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:51,548
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1111
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:56,386
It's a shame
they got a negative test result.

1112
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:59,014
But I am glad
we got the machine fixed quickly.

1113
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:01,725
Make sure to send them vouchers
for a free test, all right?

1114
01:34:03,894 --> 01:34:04,978
Where did Amir go?

1115
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:06,897
I have no idea.

1116
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:08,815
He called me.

1117
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,069
He had to leave urgently.
He said he wasn't feeling well.

1118
01:34:12,611 --> 01:34:14,655
He might have to miss a few days of work.

1119
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:17,991
Maybe it's the same thing that Marcus had.

1120
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:20,327
I guess we'll get it figured out tomorrow.

1121
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:59,533
- Hey! Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1122
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:49,750
I'm gonna go and grab something to eat.

1123
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:52,377
It's past midnight.

1124
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:54,379
I know. I didn't eat much at the party.

1125
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:56,965
I think we have something in the fridge.

1126
01:35:56,965 --> 01:36:00,052
I feel like chicken soup.
Do you want some?

1127
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:03,514
No. I'm tired.

1128
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:07,434
Okay.

1129
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:10,437
Okay.

1130
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:50,602
Hi.

1131
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:53,564
Hi.

1132
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,274
I brought you some soup.

1133
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,402
You were sick, so I brought you some soup.

1134
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:03,323
Yeah.

1135
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:12,457
Do you want to eat it now?

1136
01:37:19,047 --> 01:37:20,799
- Now, now?
- Yeah.

1137
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:48,076
Soup's really bad.

1138
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:50,287
I know.

1139
01:37:51,538 --> 01:37:53,332
I'm sorry.

1140
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:57,419
It was the only place that was open.

1141
01:37:57,419 --> 01:38:00,839
It's fine. Just don't ask me to eat it.

1142
01:38:00,839 --> 01:38:01,924
Okay.

1143
01:38:08,347 --> 01:38:09,723
I think I--

1144
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,355
I think I wanna kiss you.

1145
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:41,690
You have a scar just there.

1146
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:50,324
Yeah. Yeah, I had my appendix out.

1147
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:51,658
Think I was eight.

1148
01:39:53,035 --> 01:39:54,786
Looks like a tiny train track.

1149
01:40:00,209 --> 01:40:01,210
It does.

1150
01:40:03,504 --> 01:40:04,338
Tickles.

1151
01:40:12,054 --> 01:40:13,055
What about Ryan?

1152
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:28,403
I don't know.

1153
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:33,575
Sometimes...

1154
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:40,874
I don't know. Sometimes being in love
is lonelier than being alone, you know?

1155
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:50,551
So, I've tested many times.

1156
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:55,931
I've never been positive till now.

1157
01:40:58,141 --> 01:41:02,479
And-- Yeah. So, I just wanted to know
what was wrong with me.

1158
01:41:05,983 --> 01:41:07,192
What's wrong with me?

1159
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:13,240
I don't wanna go back.

1160
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:18,704
As in you wanna stay the night?

1161
01:41:20,497 --> 01:41:21,707
Yeah, I wanna stay here.

1162
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:42,644
I would love that.

1163
01:41:47,482 --> 01:41:48,942
I would really love that.

1164
01:41:59,661 --> 01:42:00,913
But you saw the test.

1165
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:04,917
I don't care.

1166
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:08,170
You tested positive with Ryan. Twice.

1167
01:42:15,219 --> 01:42:16,345
I'm thirsty.

1168
01:42:32,903 --> 01:42:34,446
Maybe it's better if you leave.

1169
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:38,617
Is that what you want?

1170
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:40,244
No.

1171
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:44,540
But what are we gonna do?

1172
01:42:49,169 --> 01:42:50,170
I don't know.

1173
01:42:56,009 --> 01:42:57,261
I'm tired.

1174
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:11,984
Okay.

1175
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:15,904
Hey.

1176
01:43:17,656 --> 01:43:18,657
Just stay the night.

1177
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:22,744
I'll take you home in the morning.

1178
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:13,832
Anna?

1179
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:17,669
Anna, What are you doing?

1180
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:19,171
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

1181
01:46:20,672 --> 01:46:21,924
What have you done?

1182
01:46:24,009 --> 01:46:25,219
Why would you do this?

1183
01:46:26,178 --> 01:46:28,347
- I don't--
- Look at me. I'm here.

1184
01:46:28,347 --> 01:46:30,891
- I don't want them anymore.
- I'm right here with you.

1185
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:34,478
- Okay.
- I'm here with you. Okay?

1186
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:37,940
Okay? Okay.

1187
01:46:42,194 --> 01:46:43,862
Shouldn't have done this.

1188
01:46:45,864 --> 01:46:47,074
I'm here with you, Anna.

1189
01:46:49,701 --> 01:46:50,994
It's okay.

1190
01:47:25,863 --> 01:47:27,072
This is gonna hurt.
