1
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,052
-Are you going fishing today?
-No, not today.

2
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,471
I see. Take it easy.

3
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:12,698
What's that?

4
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,511
Hello?

5
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,679
A car is on fire!

6
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,806
Please hurry!

7
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:38,808
Hello?

8
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,651
Next, in the red corner,
from the Tabata Boxing Gym,

9
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,196
it's Ran Tachibana.

10
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,742
She's won three of her fights by KO

11
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,203
in two years since she started fighting.

12
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,705
She is such a fearsome rookie.

13
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,501
Yes, she's still a newcomer,
but from what I've seen,

14
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,629
she seems to me like a boxer
with no flaws in her fighting.

15
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,297
True.

16
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,675
They're both aggressive fighters.
This'll be good.

17
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,885
Yes. The start should be good.

18
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,053
Stay calm.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,019
The fight between Ran Tachibana,
from the red corner,

20
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,397
and Sachiko Rokuouin,
from the blue corner has begun.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,524
They both are aggressive.

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,026
Rokuouin has her back to the wall.

23
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,278
Tachibana's on the attack.

24
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,154
Oh, that one landed!

25
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,156
She's on the attack.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,575
-Back off!
-She's pretty good.

27
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,911
Tachibana's another blow landed!
Repeated blows! Rokuouin strikes back!

28
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,164
Tachibana's punch landed!
Rokuouin's having trouble.

29
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,083
Tachibana's on the attack!

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,501
And another body blow!

31
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,379
This could be a pushover.
There's another body blow.

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,591
She landed another. Another! Another!

33
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,009
She's not over yet. That hurts!

34
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,302
What a shot! She's got it!

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,392
Tachibana won all four matches by KO.

36
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,019
Well done.

37
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,814
-Great job. You did it.
-She remains undefeated.

38
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,693
-She's got an incredible fighting spirit.
-Thank you.

39
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,281
It would be a shame to let her just box.

40
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,744
-Why not train her in mixed martial arts?
-No, it's too soon.

41
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,954
I want her to be a better boxer first.

42
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,999
Thank you for your interest.

43
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,295
Today's main event is about to start.

44
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,422
Please return to your seat...

45
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,342
You haven't removed
the taping or changed yet?

46
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,552
The atmosphere in the locker room
was too tense.

47
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,305
All right.

48
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,101
President Tachi had high praise for you.

49
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,855
My gym just might produce a champion.

50
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,817
Hey, it hurts.

51
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,361
Okay.

52
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,552
FIGHTING SPIRIT

53
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,032
Hey, Yuzuki!

54
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,618
Stop ignoring me.

55
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,788
Are you mad at me
because I didn't contact you sooner?

56
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,543
I finally made it to the 8th round.

57
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,137
I'll be the champ next.

58
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,266
I'll be the champion.

59
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,728
Right. Go harder.

60
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,567
Okay!

61
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,777
Go, go! Harder!

62
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,821
Thirty more seconds. Keep it up.

63
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,163
Hey, you should take a little break.

64
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,878
INVOICE

65
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,088
Electricity bill's pretty high.

66
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,634
Hey, I put up with these worn-out gloves.

67
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,386
Quit your complaining.

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,891
You sure are picky for an amateur.

69
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,434
-Huh?
-Here.

70
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,233
HIDETOSHI TABATA, MANAGER

71
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,651
Hello?

72
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,988
Yeah, she's here.

73
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,074
Okay.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,117
For you.

75
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,664
Hello?

76
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,343
Ran.

77
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,096
Yuzuki...

78
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,806
Auntie, where's Yuzuki?

79
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,474
-What'll we do?
-What happened?

80
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,021
When the fire department arrived,
it was already too late.

81
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,525
If it hadn't been
for this student ID that survived,

82
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,695
it would have taken
a long time to identify her.

83
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,540
The car was abandoned in a parking lot.

84
00:06:55,332 --> 00:07:00,212
According to forensics,
the car was filled with deodorizing spray.

85
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,215
Then it was lit on fire.

86
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,177
That makes no sense.

87
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,932
Are you saying Yuzuki killed herself?

88
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,185
According to the evidence,
that's the logical conclusion.

89
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,604
That's impossible.
She never gave off any signs.

90
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,647
Ms. Tachibana.

91
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,609
All families say the same thing.

92
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,571
"Are you sure it's the right person?"

93
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,698
"Isn't there some mistake?"

94
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,659
However, Ms. Tachibana...

95
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,873
I'm afraid that's your sister.
Her cell phone was also found in the car.

96
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,458
We ran a DNA test too, and it was a match.

97
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,213
Let's end this fast and prep the funeral.

98
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,592
The police say it's suicide, so it is.

99
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,635
Are you done?

100
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,976
Wait a second!

101
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,273
This isn't Yuzuki.

102
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,901
Yuzuki has a double tooth
on the top right.

103
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,694
This person doesn't. Look.

104
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,114
-There it is.
-Now, listen.

105
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,619
The DNA test says there's
a 99.9% probability this is her.

106
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,412
No. This isn't her.

107
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,164
Handle this.

108
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,166
I'm not finished.

109
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,168
I'll put this to you straight.

110
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,380
Your sister was young,
but she'd had a tough life.

111
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,840
Keep your hands off me!

112
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,803
You people don't understand
a thing about Yuzuki.

113
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,144
I'm terribly sorry.

114
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,396
Ran!

115
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,358
Hold on. Where do you think you're going?

116
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,569
I was just going to talk with them.

117
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,779
There's no need.

118
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,908
Handle this as a suicide.

119
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,745
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,498
Why didn't you tell me about the DNA test?

121
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,460
They explained it to me,
but I didn't understand it well.

122
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,171
I thought they'd call us again.

123
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,717
-I was going to call after that.
-You should have called me first.

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,513
There you go again
talking like a big shot.

125
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,725
If she'd died in a car accident,
we'd have gotten the insurance money.

126
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,436
She was a troublemaker
until the day she died.

127
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,273
I told you, that's not Yuzuki.

128
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,066
Why the hell can you tell?

129
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,819
You left her behind
and sent almost no money.

130
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,696
So quit acting like the protective sister.

131
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,324
Left her behind?
You have no right to say that.

132
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,826
Yes, I do.

133
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,454
I'm the one who fed her
after you took off.

134
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,665
You just wanted
the child welfare payments.

135
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,293
Then you spent it all on gambling.

136
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,377
Shut up!

137
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,632
You act like a big shot,
but what did you ever do for your sister?

138
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,346
Hey!

139
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,225
I overheard.

140
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,395
I was worried.

141
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,483
Not long ago,

142
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,611
Yuzuki showed up unexpectedly.

143
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,871
Dang, you look so cool.

144
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,498
You scared me.

145
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,542
Why are you here?

146
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,712
I got these when I gave blood at school.

147
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm supposed to be dropping weight,
but just this once is okay.

148
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,561
Hey, how'd you get this?

149
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,772
I fell.

150
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,358
Did he throw something at you again?

151
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:54,196
At least our uncle doesn't hit us
like Dad did, so I don't mind.

152
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,615
It's only when he drinks.

153
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,119
Sorry.

154
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,747
I'll get us an apartment
when I've saved the money.

155
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,542
It's all right. You focus on your fights.

156
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,171
It hurts?

157
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,089
Not at all.

158
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,968
Good. I'll put a band-aid on it later.

159
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:17,969
Thanks.

160
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,183
-This thing stinks.
-Leave my stuff alone.

161
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,768
So much dust.

162
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,145
Can I stay here tonight?

163
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,024
-If you don't mind the filth.
-Really?

164
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,736
Just leave it there.

165
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,616
That stings.

166
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,952
Deal with it.

167
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,787
FIRST AID KIT

168
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,082
You're really pretty, Ran.

169
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,167
What? Cut that out.

170
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,961
You should wear makeup.

171
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,171
No way. Removing it is such a pain.

172
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,590
-Don't you dare.
-Just try it.

173
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,259
-I'm serious. Don't.
-Just try it.

174
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,260
Seriously...

175
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,471
Yuzuki...

176
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,183
She stopped answering
her phone after that.

177
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,398
Would things have been different
if I'd been with her more?

178
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,986
What if the body is really hers?

179
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,903
Ran.

180
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,198
In life as well as in boxing,

181
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,410
if you don't learn to pace yourself,
you'll always be an amateur.

182
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,997
A real pro knows when to attack
and when to retreat.

183
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,585
Forget everything for now
and take a break.

184
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,433
Next, we have more on the incident
involving the car that exploded and burned

185
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,227
in a parking lot in Kawasaki, Kanagawa.

186
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,562
BURNED BODY FOUND IN THE CAR

187
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,607
At 6:00 a. m. on the 21st,

188
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,319
at the edge of a small fishing port
in Kawasaki, Kanagawa,

189
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,281
a car in the parking lot
suddenly exploded and caught fire.

190
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,702
Inside, the burned body
of a female was found.

191
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,914
According to investigators
from Hama-Kawasaki Police Department,

192
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,209
the female was identified as
Yuzuki Tachibana, age 17,

193
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,004
-who attended high school in Kawasaki.
-You haven't been eating much lately.

194
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,672
-The police have confirmed.
-Yum.

195
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:22,636
Authorities determined the cause of death
was suicide and have closed the case.

196
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,192
Ran. What are you doing?

197
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,985
I came to get Yuzuki's things.

198
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,239
Forget about that stuff. Leave it there.

199
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,782
Let her do whatever she wants.

200
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,451
Now we won't have to toss it out.

201
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,087
Junin?

202
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,035
Excuse me.

203
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,788
Excuse me.

204
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,670
Excuse me.

205
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,382
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

206
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,801
How'd you get in?

207
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,971
I'd like to ask you something.

208
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,557
Sorry, but we're not open.
You'll have to leave.

209
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,226
-Sorry.
-I'm looking for my sister.

210
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,937
-Take her away.
-I want some information.

211
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,314
Let go of me.

212
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,858
-I'm looking for my sister.
-What's going on here?

213
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,903
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

214
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,114
-Who's that woman?
-She's nobody.

215
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,115
Hey!

216
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,202
This is my sister, Yuzuki.

217
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,538
I think she's been to this club.
Have you seen her?

218
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,250
Not just anyone can come here.

219
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,920
Come with us.

220
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,505
Hey!

221
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,464
Hey!

222
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,015
Then why'd I find this
in my sister's room?

223
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,063
Why're you looking
for your dead sister here?

224
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,733
If you have time for that,
then go back home and crawl into bed.

225
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,695
I never said she died.

226
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,900
Go back to cleaning.

227
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,240
Quit stickin' your nose
into business that's settled.

228
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,079
Hey, take her away.

229
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,227
Yuzuki...

230
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,091
You're awake?

231
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,055
Thanks goodness.

232
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,853
That's the side effect of the antidote.
Deal with it.

233
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,063
Antidote?

234
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,941
You were drugged.

235
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,568
If I hadn't done anything,
you'd be dead by now.

236
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,622
Who are you?

237
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,582
I'm Naruse.

238
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,961
Have something to eat.

239
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,298
Who the heck are you?

240
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,851
You're looking for Yuzuki, right?

241
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,901
I did some hacking, and got videos
from the security cameras

242
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,361
in the Junin building lobby.

243
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,117
That's Yuzuki!

244
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,578
It's three days after
she apparently killed herself.

245
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,165
This man here is Azuma,
an executive in the Junin Group.

246
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,792
Three days later...

247
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,255
-Then Yuzuki is still alive?
-Probably.

248
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,340
Since they faked her suicide,

249
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:38,511
Yuzuki must be very important
to the Junin Group.

250
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,347
Hold on.
What is this Junin you're talking about?

251
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:42,849
GANG ARRESTED

252
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,267
It's a very famous corporation.

253
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,435
SHIRAISHI, VP

254
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,313
The top executives are from
old Japanese aristocratic families.

255
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,273
That club in Yokohama is

256
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,651
an exclusive club
that only select people are allowed into.

257
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,908
For the last month,
Yuzuki has been visiting that club.

258
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,993
Azuma brings her.

259
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,833
So, how come you're telling me this?

260
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,635
Though it may look like
an ordinary company,

261
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,513
they are raking in
by running a place called "The Garage. "

262
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,600
The Garage?

263
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,312
They have rogues from Japan
and abroad fight there.

264
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,399
You could call it a modern-day Colosseum.

265
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,070
My father ran a gym that went under.

266
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,990
The Junin Group provided him funds
in exchange for fighting there.

267
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:46,454
He was once
a Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion.

268
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
But then he died.

269
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,046
The police say he drowned
when he got drunk and fell into a river.

270
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,091
My father didn't drink.

271
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,969
I'm sure he died in a fight.

272
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,473
I swear I'll destroy the Junin Group.

273
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,160
It's something to behold, isn't it?

274
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,829
That's right.

275
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,956
He sure is late.

276
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,918
-Shall we begin?
-Yeah, why don't we?

277
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,547
About the selection
of a successor to our late president,

278
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,590
Vice President Shiraishi will explain.

279
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,764
I don't have anything in particular
to tell all of you.

280
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,352
I trust all the members
of the board of directors.

281
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,896
That's all I want to say.

282
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,111
Though the usual person
still isn't here, let's make a toast.

283
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,738
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

284
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,364
You sure have learned...

285
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,369
how to smoke with style, haven't you?

286
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,416
I envy you.

287
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,795
You'll never be a candidate for president.

288
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,880
It must feel nice.

289
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,012
Not really.

290
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,311
Whenever I see that samurai painting,
it reminds me.

291
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,566
I really do feel sorry for them.

292
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,611
They took up swords
to defend the nobility.

293
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,447
They became fearless warriors.

294
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,452
And they walked the path
of certain destruction.

295
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,050
You're the last fighter
who'll rise to the position of director.

296
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,563
At the very least,

297
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,692
make stacks of money for us
with that playground of yours.

298
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,449
Look at these.

299
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,328
I think this man is involved
in Yuzuki's disappearance.

300
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,955
Disappearance, huh?

301
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,332
Playing detective now, aren't you?

302
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,461
This is a surveillance video
from the Junin Group lobby.

303
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,215
This date here is three days
after that car explosion.

304
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:27,758
You can't be serious.

305
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,178
How'd you get this?

306
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,054
This can be used as evidence, right?

307
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,891
Evidence obtained illegally
can't be used as evidence.

308
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,351
And it could be faked.

309
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,853
Even if they weren't,

310
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,148
there's no proof that the person
in this photo is your sister.

311
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,858
This is Yuzuki. I am sure of it.

312
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:48,863
Even if I got it illegally, it'd be insane
not to investigate such clear evidence.

313
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,115
The report we filed
has already been certified.

314
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,534
You'd need
a lot of evidence to overturn it now.

315
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,536
I told you, this is the evidence.

316
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,788
Then bring the original files.

317
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:01,417
-It's the cops' job to find it.
-What'd you say?

318
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,460
Now, now.

319
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,004
Calm down, both of you.

320
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,174
-Handa, don't write that down!
-Sorry, sir.

321
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,260
I've had it with you.

322
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,804
I'll find her myself.

323
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,325
-Not going home yet?
-No.

324
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,869
-Good night.
-Good night.

325
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:19,996
Good night.

326
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,001
-Handa.
-Yes?

327
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,339
Did anything fishy happen
in forensics regarding this case?

328
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,385
I'm not sure.
The person in charge was transferred.

329
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,724
-Handa.
-Yes.

330
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,517
Here.

331
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,980
Can I ask you a favor?

332
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,690
Sure. What is it?

333
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,111
-Now, cross!
-Yes!

334
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,447
-Right there!
-Yes.

335
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,541
IF I COME BACK, YOU CAN GIVE THESE
TO ME THEN. SORRY. THE AMATEUR

336
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:10,880
Darn her.

337
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:20,222
Kito! Kito!

338
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,399
Kito!

339
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,692
Here you are, sir.

340
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,736
Kito! Kito!

341
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,780
She's Yuzuki's sister.

342
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,865
Before she started boxing,

343
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,326
rumor is that nobody
was a match for her in a fight.

344
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,995
She's a professional boxer now.

345
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,582
Kito shouldn't have done that.

346
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,220
Bets have been decreasing lately.

347
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,184
They've decreased
over the last three fights.

348
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,230
Tell Kito I want to talk to him.

349
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,440
Certainly, sir.

350
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,613
There's too much blood.

351
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,323
Don't drop him.

352
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,286
Good evening, sir. Put it away now.

353
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,330
Hey, you can leave now.

354
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,124
-Yes, sir.
-We gotta go.

355
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,336
You're as invincible as ever.

356
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,093
But you need to get the spectators
on the edge of their seats.

357
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,845
I'm sorry. I can't help myself.

358
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,142
You've still got energy.

359
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,811
Fight me.

360
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,231
No. I couldn't do that.

361
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,403
Why are you laughing?

362
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,992
I'm very sorry.

363
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,584
You've got ten seconds to come at me.

364
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,253
If you don't, I'll kill you.

365
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:17,798
Ten.

366
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,135
Nine.

367
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,721
Eight.

368
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:25,890
Seven.

369
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:27,850
Six.

370
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,728
Please allow me.

371
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,739
The cops have already settled
Yuzuki Tachibana's case as a suicide.

372
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,034
What if they find her sister's body?

373
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,578
What'll happen then?

374
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,960
Sir, the Vice President is on his way.

375
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,178
It stinks.

376
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,938
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

377
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,611
Good evening.

378
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,324
Don't be so harsh on Kito.

379
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,329
The company handled the cops
who showed up at the club.

380
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,665
I appreciate it.

381
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,420
Originally, we were going to build
a logistics center here.

382
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:44,677
Who'd have thought
it would turn into such a money maker?

383
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,637
Nobody imagined it.

384
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:53,352
However, this repulsiveness is a problem.

385
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,734
Why have you come to this repulsive place?

386
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,946
I heard you've gained
an interest in property recently,

387
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,658
and that you bought
a large plot of land in the suburbs.

388
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,869
Isn't that allowed?

389
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,204
No, it's fine.

390
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,124
You can do as you like.

391
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:20,337
But if you're planning
on opening another Garage there,

392
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,548
you'd better not.

393
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,055
Thank you for the warning.

394
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,101
I hadn't ridden it in a while,
but I thought it was okay.

395
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,229
You should have ridden it.

396
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,857
Oxygen in the air still causes decay.

397
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,111
Hey!

398
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,237
Huh?

399
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,408
Excuse me for a moment.

400
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,245
Excuse me.

401
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,332
How much will you pay for this?

402
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,125
A Honda Forza, huh?

403
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,047
-It's in good condition.
-Yeah.

404
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,388
Usually I'd pay 200,000 yen.
But not for this one.

405
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,015
Huh? How come?

406
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,893
It's stolen, right?

407
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,395
The anti-theft GPS tracker is busted.

408
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,900
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Yeah.

409
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,444
Now, now. What's the hurry?

410
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,946
I was just about to call the cops.

411
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,864
Hands off me!

412
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,870
You bastard!

413
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,206
Hey, get out of my way.

414
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,296
Damn you!

415
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,340
There!

416
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,929
Hey, where you going? Clean this mess up!

417
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,348
Hey, listen up!

418
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,437
Sorry. I get people like that sometimes.

419
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,772
Let's get back to business.

420
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,036
Yuzuki is?

421
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,874
Yeah. So, I'm trying to trace her
through the guy in the photo.

422
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,337
Can I stay here until I find Yuzuki?

423
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,799
For our first conversation in three years,
this is brutal.

424
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,593
What about the boxing gym?

425
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,679
I quit.

426
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,557
How can you be so reckless?

427
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,018
Why are you sure it wasn't her?

428
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,146
Her double tooth.

429
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,315
The body the police showed me
didn't have it.

430
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,319
Why the heck would the police lie to you?

431
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,447
How should I know?

432
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,825
I'm telling you this
because I once was madly in love with you.

433
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,495
This is a job for the cops, not you.

434
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,666
And I'm only asking you to help
because I was madly in love with you too.

435
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,045
If you mention the cops again,
I'll let you have it.

436
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,008
Good evening.

437
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,343
Good evening.

438
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,013
The shop's doing well?

439
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,474
Well, it's kinda out-of-the-way.

440
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,518
I live here, so the rent is cheap.

441
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,233
Here.

442
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:29,860
This?

443
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,361
Don't complain.

444
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,364
I'm not.

445
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,792
Tell me if you need anything.

446
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,127
Okay.

447
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,211
I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN SOON

448
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,142
Don't even try it.

449
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,562
If you wear these,
you'll backslide into crime like I did.

450
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,773
Can't you at least say
you'll give me a hand?

451
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,902
You're like a child.
Why are you getting so emotional?

452
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,236
Emotional?

453
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,324
Are you telling me you could remain
rational in this situation?

454
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,034
I can't.

455
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,036
Fine.

456
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,623
Let's go outside. Go on.

457
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,710
Here.

458
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,087
So, how will you look for Yuzuki?

459
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,925
I've got someone gathering info for me.

460
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,135
I'm waiting for his call.

461
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,639
-Really? A guy?
-Yeah.

462
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,183
But it's not what you think.

463
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,811
I'm just asking.
I don't care if he's your boyfriend.

464
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,023
I see.

465
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,862
-That's my burger.
-Really?

466
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,130
NARUSE

467
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,055
Hello?

468
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,058
I've located Azuma. I'm tailing him now.

469
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,103
I'll be there in a second.
Give me the address.

470
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,020
Okay.

471
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:58,735
Hey, Ran.

472
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,696
-I'll be back.
-What?

473
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,454
Azuma is inside.

474
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:15,419
I believe he's buying the drugs
they give out to the VIPs at the club.

475
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,837
What a douche.

476
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,174
Wait. You can't just walk right in.

477
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,762
Let's tail Azuma
after he finishes the drug deal.

478
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,265
I'm not waiting until then.

479
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,483
Hey, are you done yet?

480
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,861
Yes.

481
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,696
You're kidding.

482
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,574
I'll go check it out. You stay here.

483
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,493
-It's too dangerous.
-We need to gather evidence.

484
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,996
Over here.

485
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,456
Hey.

486
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,739
Thank you.

487
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,785
Here's a sample.

488
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,792
100,000 yen per gram.

489
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,128
That's expensive, you rip-off drug addict.

490
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:45,383
By the way, what happened
to that stand-in you've got?

491
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,676
She's a high schooler, right?

492
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,386
Shut up.

493
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,806
You're just a drug addict.

494
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,811
-You always talk way too much.
-Cut that out!

495
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,360
Beat it.

496
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,237
-Tell me...
-It should be fun.

497
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,572
What's that girl like?

498
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,741
Where did you get her?

499
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,661
-Hey, tell me.
-Shut up.

500
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,829
Listen up.

501
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,581
I can get her some work
after you're done with her.

502
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,876
We could make a lot of money with them.

503
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:28,593
By the way, that stand-in,
her name was Yuzuki, wasn't it?

504
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,637
Shut your fuckin' trap or I'll kill you!

505
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,891
Hey, what are you doing?

506
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,478
Hey, don't just stand there.

507
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:39,437
-Get her!
-Yes, sir.

508
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,647
-Go!
-Get her!

509
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,656
Who the hell is she?

510
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,513
Hey, this way.

511
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,514
Everyone spread out.

512
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,584
Hey!

513
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:01,978
He's above you!

514
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,450
Oh...

515
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,911
I missed.

516
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,792
Now, it's time for the real deal.

517
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,629
Huh?

518
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,401
You're the sister of the chick
who burned up, right?

519
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,529
I heard she was turned to a crisp.

520
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,161
Shut up, you bastard!

521
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,300
We've got to run.

522
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,469
-Naruse!
-You go on ahead.

523
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,636
Let's go, Ran.

524
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,447
We're almost there.

525
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,949
It's not that deep. I'm okay.

526
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:22,327
You've been stabbed. You're not okay.

527
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,371
Hold on.

528
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,422
I wish you'd stop doing
this kind of thing.

529
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,467
Join that gym you were invited to.

530
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,511
I'll be fine.

531
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,891
I could never be a boxer.

532
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,812
If you died, Ran,

533
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,856
what would I do?

534
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,527
I can't live without you.

535
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,680
HAMA-KAWASAKI POLICE STATION

536
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,806
Mr. Suzuki.

537
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,434
Thanks.

538
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,103
I had my friend in forensics
check it out secretly.

539
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,439
Just like you suspected,

540
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:36,526
the results showed that the corpse
wasn't that of Yuzuki Tachibana.

541
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,240
DNA TEST RESULTS

542
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,617
PROBABILITY OF IDENTITY MATCH: 5.3%

543
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,329
Then how come the results
were different before?

544
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,915
Either the sample was contaminated,

545
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,128
or the DNA sample was switched.

546
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:01,968
Actually,

547
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:05,889
I heard Yuzuki Tachibana
has a very unique blood type.

548
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,852
It's called Rh-null.
Only a few people in the world have it.

549
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:15,023
It's also known as "golden blood. "

550
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,943
-"Golden blood"?
-Yes.

551
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,446
Morning.

552
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,989
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

553
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:32,499
Are we really going to investigate
this case again?

554
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,670
Yes, I plan to.

555
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:41,049
There are so many suspicious points.

556
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,511
It's not something we can handle.

557
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,307
But if I don't do anything about this,

558
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,311
what was the point of becoming a cop?

559
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:02,028
I'm sorry, but this is
as far as I can go with this.

560
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:07,992
I'm getting scared.

561
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,662
How'd you find us?

562
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,374
Motorcycles nowadays have
anti-theft GPS trackers on them.

563
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,751
You're taking this too far.

564
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,503
He was gonna kill you.

565
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,882
I'm more afraid for Yuzuki
who's been kidnapped by those assholes.

566
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,975
Thank goodness.
Looks like Naruse got away.

567
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,104
-Is that the guy?
-Yeah.

568
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,941
Naruse found the lead on Yuzuki.

569
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:44,904
Can you trust him?

570
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,489
What's with you?

571
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,450
Why are you so bothered by him?

572
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,911
It's not what you think.

573
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:59,335
You've become a real boxer
just like Yuzuki wished.

574
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:03,840
Is this really something
worth abandoning all that for?

575
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,302
What? You want me to give up on Yuzuki?

576
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,511
That's not what I mean.

577
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:13,141
You could go to the cops again
or spill it to the press.

578
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,019
There are better ways to do this.

579
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,438
How often are you going to mention that?
I've had it.

580
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,525
-I'm worried about you.
-Butt outta my business!

581
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,028
You're injured, you know.

582
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,826
Beaten by three?

583
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,049
-Mr. Oishi.
-Yes?

584
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,344
How much...

585
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,599
have I paid you all this time?

586
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,228
If you couldn't do the job,

587
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:03,274
then I'll get the chief of police
to find someone else for me.

588
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:05,985
I'm sorry.

589
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,662
Mr. Oishi, if you'd gotten
a proper stand-in,

590
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,458
this never would have happened.

591
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,799
Her sister, that brat, Ran Tachibana,

592
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,219
came snooping here.

593
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,850
How will you take responsibility?

594
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,271
Huh?

595
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:46,901
Mr. Nikaido, I will handle everything.

596
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,528
Then...

597
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,324
I want you to kill Ran Tachibana.

598
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,246
Where's your answer?

599
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,583
Answer me.

600
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,170
I had all the records revised
to make it look like a gang conflict.

601
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,175
You just don't get it.

602
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,804
What's with all this fat?

603
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,181
Pretty pathetic for a cop.

604
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,687
Do you think
Ran Tachibana will believe that?

605
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,608
Mr. Oishi, you just don't understand

606
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,278
what humans are like.

607
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,096
"Knuckle Girl, " huh?

608
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,269
Get Ran Tachibana into the ring.
She'll fight Kito.

609
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,731
What? Are you serious?

610
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,859
Make sure you bring me Ran Tachibana.

611
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,070
Naruse.

612
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,157
I brought Azuma's cell phone.

613
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:22,246
With all this evidence, there's no way
the police can turn a blind eye.

614
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,667
Of course,
they can't act just on this alone.

615
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,170
Isn't this some kind of hacking program?

616
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,589
You know how to use that stuff?

617
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:36,135
Yes. Just how do you think I got my hands
on that security camera footage?

618
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,933
CALLER ID WITHHELD

619
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:48,856
Ran.

620
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,528
Hello?

621
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,238
Ran Tachibana.

622
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,907
I'll let you see your sister.

623
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:03,079
Only on the condition that you
hand over my phone and photos you took.

624
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,875
Give it to the cops
and Yuzuki will be dead.

625
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,045
I'm here. Where are you?

626
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:12,880
Open up.

627
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,223
Where's Yuzuki?

628
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,271
Yudai Kito.

629
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,690
You know him, right?

630
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,610
I heard he put you down
with a single punch at our club.

631
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,366
I bet that was frustrating.

632
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,285
That's none of your business.

633
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,245
What is it you want?

634
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,670
It's really quite simple.

635
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,717
Fight Kito at the Garage.

636
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,761
If you win,
we'll give you back your sister.

637
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,555
If you lose...

638
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:06,309
I think you get the picture.

639
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,520
You can bring a cornerman.

640
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,731
I don't care what you're planning.

641
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,107
Let me see Yuzuki!

642
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,444
Oh, that's right.

643
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,696
That's pretty important.

644
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,325
Turn around. Have a look.

645
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,954
Ran! Ran!

646
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,998
-Yuzuki!
-Ran!

647
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,334
Wait! Yuzuki!

648
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,337
-Wait!
-Ran!

649
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,339
-Ran!
-Yuzuki!

650
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,799
Wait!

651
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:39,717
Come back!

652
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:41,594
Yuzuki!

653
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:53,856
Open up!

654
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:59,695
Come to Junin Club in two weeks.

655
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,199
I'll let you use brass knuckles.

656
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,912
If you tell the cops
or cause any other trouble,

657
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,165
we'll deliver you Yuzuki's head in a box.

658
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,630
-Drive.
-Hey! Wait!

659
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,966
-See you later.
-Hey. Wait!

660
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,521
There's no way you can win.

661
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,191
Let's call the cops now.

662
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,527
We've got plenty of evidence.

663
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,278
No cops. Don't you dare.

664
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,531
They won't kill Yuzuki that easily.

665
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,701
They went so far as to fake her suicide.

666
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,411
How can you know that?

667
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:53,290
I mean, she was right in front of me
just a little while ago.

668
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,127
Ran.

669
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,340
I'm telling you these things aren't easy.

670
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,177
This Garage or arena or wherever it is,

671
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,179
there's no way I can let you go there.

672
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,306
Accept the fight at the Garage.

673
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,603
From Azuma's phone,
I found out that the servers

674
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,773
at the Garage had records
of all the spectators' names and bets.

675
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,361
If we can steal that data,
we could use it to negotiate.

676
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,202
Don't you get it?

677
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,249
If she fights in an illegal match,

678
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,378
Ran may never be allowed to box again.
Can you live with that?

679
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,132
Is anything more important
than her sister's life?

680
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,593
Isn't Ran's life also important?

681
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:52,099
Can't you see we don't have the power
to do anything about this?

682
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,392
That's enough, Shun.

683
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,730
Without Yuzuki,

684
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,733
there's no point in me boxing.

685
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:07,573
That's why I'm going to fight
no matter what.

686
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:27,593
This is where Ran stayed.

687
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,722
-Here?
-Yes.

688
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:37,478
She left this note and disappeared.

689
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:43,651
Officer, she's got talent.

690
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,194
Please find her.

691
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,780
-Please don't bow.
-Okay.

692
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,372
Investigating privately sure must be hard.

693
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,295
I'd like to speak with you...

694
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,465
about the Yuzuki Tachibana's case.

695
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,985
I can't ignore this.

696
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,295
You think you can beat that fat pig

697
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,298
just by punching him?

698
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,467
Cut that out! What's your point?

699
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,803
You need a way to win.

700
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:56,640
In boxing, there are refs and rules.

701
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,058
But this is a different story.

702
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,812
Then, lend me a hand.

703
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:02,855
That's why

704
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,317
I'm helping you train like this.

705
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,445
Here comes a bigger one.

706
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:12,448
Dodge it!

707
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,285
KAMIYA GARAGE IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED

708
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,495
It's not going up.

709
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,872
You're lifting it now. Go!

710
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,332
Hang in there. Keep it up!

711
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,833
Give it all you've got!

712
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:26,337
-Don't give up.
-Shut up.

713
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,799
There's only one way to defeat
a giant who's over 6.6 feet tall.

714
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,845
Speed. With that as your weapon,
tire out your opponent.

715
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:37,389
One more.

716
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:41,227
Hold on a little longer.

717
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:42,394
Twenty-six!

718
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,146
Don't attack uselessly.

719
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,147
Okay!

720
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,858
-That's still 26.
-What?

721
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,827
Dodging is the best attack.

722
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,914
If you get caught,
you'll be at a disadvantage.

723
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,709
If this happens,
you'll get strangled to death.

724
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:12,091
One more!

725
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,721
If you confuse your opponent
with unexpected moves,

726
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,015
regardless of how big or small they are,

727
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,726
they'll start thinking
that they just might lose.

728
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,856
The moment they suspect they might lose,
they'll start tiring.

729
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,694
Whether it's Ali or Tyson,
when they tire, they lose.

730
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,880
The most important thing of all
is maintaining balance.

731
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:56,343
The moment you lose the balance,
everything starts falling apart.

732
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:06,812
Hi.

733
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,239
Wow.

734
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:24,246
Wear that during the match.

735
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:27,458
Thank you.

736
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,021
It's the anesthesia.

737
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,315
There's no need to worry.

738
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:08,082
When her special blood is used
for biometric authentication,

739
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,460
only Mr. Nikaido can unlock the account.

740
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:15,714
The test of the account security system
was a success.

741
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:30,521
I found the layout of Junin Club.

742
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,065
This will be plenty.

743
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,235
I can convince my superiors with this.

744
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,530
-I'll go to the station--
-Will going to the station solve this?

745
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,031
Huh?

746
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,828
Don't you realize that they got
contacts inside the department?

747
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:52,793
Even if you get a warrant,
they might still kill Yuzuki.

748
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,883
-You want us to sneak inside?
-Yes.

749
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:01,927
Just the two of us?

750
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:13,564
Watch my back.

751
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,805
You must be Knuckle Girl. How cute!

752
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,683
-Oh, I'm sorry. Welcome.
-It's Knuckle Girl.

753
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,101
-You're so cute!
-You're so cute!

754
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,146
You're scaring me.

755
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,689
-Coming through!
-Excuse us!

756
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,441
Come on.

757
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,446
Ran.

758
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,701
-Hurry up, Mr. Suzuki.
-Okay.

759
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:11,371
Mr. Azuma. She's here.

760
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,000
We brought her.

761
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:16,919
Come with me.

762
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,145
It's ready.

763
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:47,282
Lay a single finger on Yuzuki,
and I swear I'll kill you.

764
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,412
Dang. You're scarin' me.

765
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:56,959
But I wonder how long
you can stay so cocky.

766
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,086
Shut up, asshole.

767
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,304
This way.

768
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:23,777
Excuse me.

769
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,238
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

770
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:29,741
Today's fight should be
more exciting than we expected.

771
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,787
It's a great story.

772
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,793
The Garage is on this floor.

773
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,048
It's no good. There's no signal.

774
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,467
All means of communication
have been blocked.

775
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,886
-Let's go.
-Right.

776
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:56,810
Hey!

777
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,228
Who the hell are you?

778
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,829
I think that's the server room.

779
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,415
-Okay. Let's go.
-Right.

780
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,210
Wear these even though
they might impede you.

781
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,467
If you lose, use of your elbows,
it'll be fatal.

782
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:33,430
Ran.

783
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,058
I know you can win.

784
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,147
Thanks.

785
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:47,319
Any bets on Knuckle Girl
will pay out at an amazing 30-to-one.

786
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:53,784
And the payout for Coins
is the highest in history.

787
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,204
What? Is it because Knuckle Girl is cute?

788
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,540
I'm looking forward to seeing
her face get tattered.

789
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,335
It is so annoying that she's so tall.

790
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:06,880
-Tear her legs off too, Mr. Kito!
-Mental.

791
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,131
Mental.

792
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,174
Everyone...

793
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,468
Here's the main server.
I'll make a quick copy of it.

794
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,390
Got it. I'll look for things
that could be used as evidence.

795
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,780
Start the countdown.

796
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,574
Countdown, start.

797
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,914
Okay, everyone, it's been a long wait,

798
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,959
but the match is about to begin.

799
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:53,093
Unbeaten during
his eight years of fighting,

800
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,179
this invincible colossus
is the undefeated champion.

801
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,306
Giant Kito!

802
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:08,567
He'll be facing the woman who's come
to save her imprisoned sister,

803
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,610
the indomitable female boxer,

804
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,738
"Knuckle Girl. "

805
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:18,201
For today's fight, in consideration of
the differences in sex and weight,

806
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:22,456
Knuckle Girl will be allowed
to use knuckledusters.

807
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,499
Now, let's have a look at the odds.

808
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,879
This is the current rate
that Junin Coins are being traded at.

809
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:35,635
All right, time to begin the countdown
for the fight between Knuckle Girl

810
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:39,473
and Giant Kito
which we've all been waiting for.

811
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:40,807
Here we go!

812
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:45,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

813
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,254
You can do this.

814
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,822
Hey. Did you come here for a jog?

815
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,335
No. It's too soon for that, Ran.

816
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,051
Ran!

817
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:25,912
Go for it.

818
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,916
Tighten. That's it.

819
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,595
Tough it out! Tough it out!

820
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,939
Yay! He's gonna kill her!

821
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,357
Yay!

822
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,234
Ran...

823
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,701
Kito! Kito!

824
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:28,892
Ran!

825
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,783
The moment I bust your arm,

826
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,911
you'll become my toy.

827
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,832
You thought you could win?

828
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,376
So naive.

829
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,756
It's not fun to end this too soon.

830
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,593
I plan on having fun
while I slowly kill you.

831
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,016
Kito! Kito!

832
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,810
Kito! Kito!

833
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,605
Tough it out! He'll do you in.

834
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,317
Ran, your legs. Use your legs!

835
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,028
Knees! Use your knees!

836
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:29,411
Kito! Kito!

837
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,545
If I tire, I'll lose.

838
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,061
Ran!

839
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,506
Stand up before him!

840
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,549
Yes.

841
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,385
Come on!

842
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,137
You got it, Ran!

843
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,608
Stop it! Ran!

844
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,194
Stop it!

845
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,656
Come to your senses!

846
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:51,910
He'll die.

847
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:54,871
Ran!

848
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,585
-Come on!
-Get him!

849
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:01,586
Just do it.

850
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:03,755
-Get him!
-Kill him!

851
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:04,756
You can do it!

852
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,051
Just do it already!

853
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,595
Get him now!

854
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,055
Kill him now!

855
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,358
There it is.

856
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:25,860
Respond if you can hear me.

857
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,161
Can you go check the server room?

858
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,623
On my way.

859
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,292
Something is wrong. Hurry up.

860
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,716
Why it's not coming off?

861
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:54,806
Is this it?

862
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,490
The hard drive for the security cameras.

863
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,035
This will put a stop
to this game for sure.

864
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,542
Okay.

865
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,393
Mr. Oishi.

866
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:45,440
I told you, the case is closed.

867
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,360
Why don't you people listen?

868
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,407
What the hell is this?

869
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,286
We...

870
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,790
We're cops...

871
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,547
Mr. Suzuki.

872
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:35,990
Kill him.

873
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,706
This game doesn't end
until one of you dies.

874
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,419
Fuck that shit.

875
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:53,049
Bring me Yuzuki now!

876
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,473
You can't kill him, huh?

877
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,368
Useless piece of shit.

878
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,300
Move it!

879
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,888
How dare you?

880
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,391
Keep your promise!

881
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,145
Like I said,

882
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,606
this game doesn't end

883
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,401
until one of you dies.

884
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,821
You people really have lost your minds.

885
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,201
Watching you fight...

886
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,290
made me want to fight you.

887
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,225
-What's up?
-Oishi.

888
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,728
-What?
-The police just called.

889
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,148
Got it. I'll contact you later.

890
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:42,033
Director Nikaido, someone called the cops.

891
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:47,955
I'll get more info soon.

892
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,124
I think we should leave now.

893
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:03,638
-What about them?
-Hey!

894
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:06,808
-Where the hell are you going?
-We've got no choice.

895
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:09,560
Kill them.

896
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,523
Kill the two in the Garage.

897
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,108
Wait!

898
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,152
Wait!

899
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,321
Yuzuki!

900
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,573
Yuzuki!

901
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,158
Wait!

902
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,703
-Yuzuki!
-Mr. Kamiya.

903
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,038
Naruse.

904
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,706
Yuzuki!

905
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,336
Yuzuki...

906
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,634
Ran! Let's go.

907
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,053
Let's go, Ran! Stand up!

908
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,013
Hurry!

909
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,101
Get in the elevator!

910
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:51,561
Go left!

911
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,332
Close it fast!

912
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,675
Ran!

913
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,139
Hurry up!

914
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,658
What's her name again?

915
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,743
Yuzuki Tachibana.

916
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,162
Yuzuki...

917
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,791
That's a cute name.

918
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,628
Leak the information to the media.

919
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:42,547
Yes, sir.

920
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:50,680
Late last night at an exclusive club
in Naka Ward, Yokohama,

921
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,640
police found the body of Yudai Kito,
age 32,

922
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,352
-leader of a low-level criminal gang.
-Seriously?

923
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,437
In addition, a police sergeant

924
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,607
from Hama-Kawasaki Police Station
who happened to be there...

925
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:04,277
-What's going on?
-... is missing.

926
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,530
The police are tracking down a group
of two men and a woman...

927
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,240
Hey! Get back to practicing!

928
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,202
...who were caught on security cameras,
including the deceased Mr. Kito

929
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,121
who, they believe, are involved.

930
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,132
DNA TEST RESULTS

931
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,175
What's this about?

932
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:31,178
If there's anything you regret doing,
then turn yourself in.

933
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,015
I'll give you that chance.

934
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,352
Handa, you just stick to doing your work.

935
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:40,771
Mr. Oishi, why did you
become a police officer?

936
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,691
This is my job.

937
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:56,579
Hey, Azuma.
Don't turn this into a bigger mess.

938
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,666
If this keeps up, I might have to do
something you won't like.

939
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:05,504
At any rate, call me
as soon as you hear this message.

940
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,700
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

941
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:37,203
-What should I do?
-Call an ambulance.

942
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,205
I got rid of him.

943
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,460
Damn that bastard
for all the troubles he caused.

944
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:47,797
All right. Go on.

945
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:54,512
Good evening.

946
01:22:58,516 --> 01:22:59,684
Vice President.

947
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:07,149
What the hell is going on?

948
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:10,361
We victims were made out
to be the criminals,

949
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:13,781
but nothing has happened to the people
who should be running.

950
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,451
Why have we been made out to be murderers?

951
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,662
It's all my fault.

952
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,706
I'm sorry.

953
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,137
It's me.

954
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:42,601
A friend of mine owns this place.

955
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,271
Nobody will ever know.
You can rest easy here.

956
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:50,901
You must be hungry. Eat up. Go on.

957
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,197
I'm sorry...

958
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:58,617
we have to rely on you like this.

959
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,828
Okay. I'll be going.

960
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,749
If you need anything, call me.

961
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,959
Go on now. Eat!

962
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,080
Usually, you're much more careful.

963
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,504
We lost 30% of our members
thanks to that incident.

964
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:53,172
I am terribly sorry.

965
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,636
This must irk you as well.

966
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:00,679
But you know what?

967
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:06,310
The cops raided the place,
so someone has to pay for that.

968
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,103
I am very ashamed.

969
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:13,275
You say you're ashamed,

970
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:16,821
but you're trying
to run away with everything

971
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,739
that was in the president's account.

972
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:25,955
I heard that this girl Yuzuki
was how it all started.

973
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,709
You used her rare blood

974
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,548
to revise all the info in the account.

975
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,885
You used that rare blood
to build a security system,

976
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:45,349
and have well over
300 billion yen in deposits

977
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,476
which you're trying to escape with.

978
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,526
How did you come up with such an idea?

979
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,530
I graduated from the University of Tokyo,
but never thought of it.

980
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,575
Don't move.

981
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,205
Mr. Shiraishi,

982
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,917
let me tell you
what the weakness of you elites is.

983
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,173
You can't pull the trigger
when the chips are down.

984
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,050
What?

985
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:24,722
When you threaten someone,
shoot them first, then threaten them.

986
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,018
Why you...

987
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:40,863
There's no way they'll ever kill Yuzuki.

988
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:46,911
The Garage maintains its accounts
using a biometric authentication program.

989
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:50,539
When I checked the passwords
for all the files here,

990
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:52,458
they're all iris images and fingerprints.

991
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:57,630
However, this IP here
can only be opened using a blood type.

992
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,883
This is the Garage's main account.

993
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,052
In other words,
it's the account for deposits.

994
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:07,640
Yuzuki is being used
as the security system.

995
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:12,937
Hold on. Is that because
Yuzuki has "golden blood"?

996
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,229
Yes.

997
01:27:14,355 --> 01:27:15,731
I get it now.

998
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:21,111
To keep all the deposits for himself,
Nikaido closed the account.

999
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:23,906
The cryptocurrency used
at the Garage, Junin Coin,

1000
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,283
is only useful
if it's converted into cash.

1001
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:29,119
So I used a malicious code
to lock the system,

1002
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:31,163
and prevent it from being converted.

1003
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,499
You're good, Naruse.

1004
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,127
So we can use this
to fight these guys, right?

1005
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,384
Did you hear something just now?

1006
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,262
It might be Mr. Tabata.

1007
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,640
I'll have a look. You keep on working.

1008
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,894
This file can unlock the system.

1009
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,398
-This should do the trick.
-Thanks.

1010
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:13,831
-Shun? Shun!
-Stay inside.

1011
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,876
It's nothing! I'm fine!

1012
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,103
-We gotta get outta here!
-Okay.

1013
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:47,948
-Shun!
-Mr. Kamiya!

1014
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:50,784
-Shun!
-Wait! Wait!

1015
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:51,869
Shun!

1016
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,913
Shun, hang in there!

1017
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:58,459
Ran.

1018
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,755
I was...

1019
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:04,840
able to...

1020
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,720
help you a little, right?

1021
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:14,266
Hurry.

1022
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:18,103
Yuzuki is waiting.

1023
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:19,730
Please!

1024
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,733
Hold on a little longer!

1025
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,653
Shun! Shun!

1026
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:29,114
Stay with me!

1027
01:29:30,074 --> 01:29:32,534
Please. Please, Shun!

1028
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:34,369
Shun! Wake up!

1029
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:53,949
Mr. Kamiya was put into intensive care.

1030
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:57,244
He's still unconscious.

1031
01:30:58,704 --> 01:30:59,580
Thanks.

1032
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:02,958
Send me Azuma's location.

1033
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,878
What do you plan on doing?

1034
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,090
We've come this far.

1035
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:14,011
I'm ending this.

1036
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:24,354
I've sold all the businesses for cash.

1037
01:31:28,609 --> 01:31:32,905
I arranged for cabins on a cruise ship
from Yokohama to Australia.

1038
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,078
Hold on a second, please.

1039
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,802
Where do you think you're going?

1040
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:57,846
Let me talk to him.

1041
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:09,608
Could this be Ran Tachibana?

1042
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:12,277
Let's make a deal.

1043
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:13,987
You never fail to surprise me.

1044
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:16,865
What do you have in mind?

1045
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,283
You haven't noticed yet?

1046
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:21,161
I've disabled your secret account.

1047
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:22,537
What?

1048
01:32:29,962 --> 01:32:32,923
-Hey, check the account.
-Yes, sir.

1049
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,139
It's no good.

1050
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,731
Very interesting.

1051
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,193
-Give me the code.
-Ran!

1052
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:00,784
If you do, I'll release your sister.

1053
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:03,495
Release Yuzuki first or there's no deal.

1054
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,964
I sent you the location. Meet me there.

1055
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:16,174
Bring me Yuzuki unharmed.

1056
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,929
Of course, Ran Tachibana.

1057
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,166
What's this?

1058
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:52,002
MY NAME IS NARUSE.
I HAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST JUNIN GROUP.

1059
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:03,722
Hurry up.

1060
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:14,608
Push the button.

1061
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,304
Ran.

1062
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:47,099
Yuzuki.

1063
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:51,853
Ran!

1064
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:54,773
Ran!

1065
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:02,489
Yuzuki!

1066
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:18,839
Glad you came.

1067
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:25,095
I never thought I'd face you here.

1068
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:26,513
Enough of this crap!

1069
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:29,766
Like you promised, give me Yuzuki.

1070
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:30,767
Ran.

1071
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,106
The key players are here.

1072
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,692
Let's fight, you and me.

1073
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:40,735
If you defeat me,

1074
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:44,281
I'll give you back your sister.

1075
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:48,618
Handing over Yuzuki will end this.

1076
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:50,954
Enough of this bullshit.

1077
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,707
I'd never fight a scumbag like you.

1078
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,459
That's repulsive.

1079
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:04,092
Repulsive?

1080
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:07,095
Yuzuki!

1081
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:08,138
Come here!

1082
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,975
You stimulate me every time.

1083
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:17,105
Let's see if your drive
and fighting spirit...

1084
01:36:21,193 --> 01:36:22,736
can defeat me.

1085
01:36:30,577 --> 01:36:31,620
Come at me.

1086
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:36,082
Ran...

1087
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:38,668
Don't.

1088
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,953
Ran. Ran!

1089
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:26,466
Stop, please!

1090
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,176
Stop!

1091
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:53,868
You think I'd ever make a deal...

1092
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,288
with the likes of you?

1093
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:58,832
Stop!

1094
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:10,802
Ran!

1095
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:13,138
Ran! Help me!

1096
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:18,184
Ran! Ran!

1097
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:20,103
No!

1098
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:21,313
Ran!

1099
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,107
Ran! No!

1100
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:40,832
Ran!

1101
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,172
Ran!

1102
01:38:57,265 --> 01:38:59,142
The world of the Garage is...

1103
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,022
my dream.

1104
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,487
It's my everything.

1105
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:20,246
I won't let anyone interfere.

1106
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:22,916
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1107
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:25,168
What the hell did we ever do to you?

1108
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:27,420
Hey!

1109
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:29,881
Yuzuki...

1110
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,174
Stubborn bitch.

1111
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:35,637
End it.

1112
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:43,812
Don't! No!

1113
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:48,483
No! No!

1114
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,528
No!

1115
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,470
Ran!

1116
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:19,824
Ran!

1117
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,621
Police! Don't move!

1118
01:41:27,624 --> 01:41:29,876
-Go check the other rooms.
-Yes.

1119
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:34,506
This is Handa. Three injured.
Get me three ambulances immediately.

1120
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:35,799
Arrest this man.

1121
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:41,471
Yuzuki.

1122
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:04,869
6 MONTHS LATER

1123
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:12,502
Hello.

1124
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,379
Hello.

1125
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:22,595
Yuzuki.

1126
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:29,769
-Yuzuki.
-Thanks.

1127
01:42:39,988 --> 01:42:41,281
Tabata's rookie.

1128
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:44,242
She won all four of her fights by KO.

1129
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:45,660
All right!

1130
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:50,456
Here comes the lone genius
a. k. a. "Knuckle Girl. "

1131
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,749
In the red corner...

1132
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:55,712
Ran Tachibana!
