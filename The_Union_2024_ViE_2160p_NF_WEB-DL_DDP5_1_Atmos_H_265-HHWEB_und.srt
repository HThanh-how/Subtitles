You wanna pick up the tab

I'm sure Langley will reimburse.

339
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,194
Hey, Maggie. We'll have three bacon rolls
and three black coffees for takeaway.

340
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,570
Ketchup or brown sauce?

341
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,155
Just ketchup, thank you.

342
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,741
-What the hell is a brown sauce?
-I have no idea.

343
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,619
Those guys over there, they work for you?

344
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,621
[Brennan] If they did,
you wouldn't have noticed 'em.

345
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,541
So look here. This is Derek Mitchell.
Former CIA analyst.

346
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,543
He was on the run
with top secret information.

347
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,504
-Guy you were tryin' to get in Trieste?
-Yep.

348
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,422
-Yeah, Trieste.
-Except you guys messed it up.

349
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,008
Yeah, we messed it up.

350
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,012
Now Mitchell has a hole
where his face used to be,

351
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,848
the intel is in the wind,
and we are up shit creek.

352
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,267
Know what they call that?

353
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,271
[Mike] I don't know.
Space Needle? Harry Potter Wand?

354
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,108
The BT Tower.
You know what the Union call it?

355
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,735
Home.

356
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,117
Look in here, Mike.

357
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,163
How did they get all of my shit like that?

358
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,665
Check this out.

359
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,835
Juliet Quinn, AKA the Auctioneer.

360
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,546
We found out she's selling the intel
on the black market in London

361
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,881
on behalf of a mystery seller.

362
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,802
The mystery seller being whoever killed
your guys and stole the intel.

363
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,304
Those are the kind of details
you're gonna have to remember

364
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,764
if you wanna pass the test.

365
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,641
-What test?
-The entrance test.

366
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,642
I don't like tests.

367
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,935
[dramatic music playing]

368
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
-[man 1] Same thing?
-[man 2] Yeah.

369
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
Wow! Holy shit!

370
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,067
Whoa.

371
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,697
In two weeks, that stolen intel's
gonna be sold at a black market auction

372
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,615
that we need to be a part of.

373
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,119
-That's where you come in.
-Hey, Athena.

374
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,163
What's he talking about, where I come in?

375
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,166
-Any underlying medical issues?
-Not that I know of.

376
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,501
Are you on any medications presently?

377
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,961
I got tranquilized last night.

378
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,504
-I don't know if that counts.
-Nope.

379
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,215
Hey, what did you mean by
"that's where I come in"?

380
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,261
That intel Mitchell stole
wasn't launch codes or blueprints

381
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,846
for some secret missile base.

382
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,725
It was… information
about every man and woman

383
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,561
who has ever served
a Western-allied country.

384
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,356
Every local cop,
every rifleman in the marines.

385
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,069
Every spook at MI5, MI6… FBI, CIA,

386
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,905
and, yeah, the Union.

387
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
That intel gets into the wrong hands,

388
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,701
our ability to protect the public
is history.

389
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,913
Here's the rub, Mike.
We need somebody clean.

390
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,373
If I send in somebody
that could turn up as Miss July

391
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,752
on the FBI's
most promising agents calendar this year,

392
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,464
they're gonna get their head blown off,
and the mission is DOA.

393
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,884
So we need somebody with no history.

394
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,303
Basically, we need a nobody.

395
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,429
[Brennan] Correct.

396
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,014
After you.

397
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,726
[Mike] Hey, what's up, big man?

398
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,937
Oh, what the-- Rox, what the hell?

399
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,147
-[man] You're a tough guy, huh?
-What? Hey!

400
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,357
Yeah, that's right.

401
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,733
-Bro. What?
-What's up, man?

402
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,819
Let me see how tough you are now.
Too pretty to be a tough guy.

403
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,446
Don't let the pretty face fool you.
I'm from the street.

404
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,283
Yeah? Which street is that?
Sesame Street? [laughs]

405
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,456
-Keep the new guy in one piece.
-There you go. Oh, you want some more?

406
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,667
Come on at me, Elmo.
Let's see what you got.

407
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,043
[Rox] Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,586
[man laughing]

409
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,546
Yeah, I can work with this.

410
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,091
This is Frank Pfeiffer,
physical specialist.

411
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,927
You were about to say you're not sure
if you're the guy for this,

412
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,971
and honestly, I think that's a good sign.

413
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm not sure either,
but Roxanne believes you can do it, so…

414
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,270
You got till the end of the day
to make up your mind, okay?

415
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,279
You need a nobody, huh?
Why don't you get one of these people?

416
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,949
-I didn't mean that, Mike.
-No, you meant a nobody in a good way.

417
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,409
[scoffs]

418
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,912
I mean, just yesterday, I'm waking up
next to Nicole Hoffman in Paterson.

419
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
I hadn't thought about you in forever.

420
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,500
Today, I'm in London, and you're asking me
to risk my life for you?

421
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,211
-None of this makes any sense.
-Wait. Let me get this straight.

422
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,714
You had sex
with our seventh grade English teacher?

423
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,842
-That is not the point, Roxanne.
-What is the point, Mike?

424
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,511
Why me? You haven't seen me in 25 years.

425
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,181
A guy who can be on a tiny beam
a thousand feet in the air

426
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,184
and keep his cool,
who used to be an all-star athlete.

427
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,437
A guy I remembered I could count on.

428
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,023
But I'm supposed to count on you.
You dropped out of my life.

429
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,942
I went to college!
Let's not make this thing overly dramatic.

430
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,902
No, no. You disappeared.

431
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,487
That was the Union. That wasn't me.

432
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,906
I didn't know that.
How was I supposed to know that?

433
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,783
-[poignant music playing]
-I'm sorry.

434
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,495
We're not asking you
for a lifetime commitment here.

435
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,748
It's one operation. That's it.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,084
[Mike sighs]

437
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,594
Look, first-class ticket to Newark,
leaves tonight.

438
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,804
You could be back
in Wilson's bar tomorrow.

439
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,141
Same bar, same stool, same friends.
Your choice.

440
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,943
[music intensifies]

441
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,705
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Oh!

442
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,836
Roxanne Hall?

443
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
Wait. Wa-- Ma, how do you know that?

444
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,257
-I know everything.
-Look.

445
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,676
I know you must be worried,
but I can explain.

446
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,470
I always liked her for you.

447
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,597
She's pretty and smart.

448
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,642
Comes from a good family. Ambitious.

449
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,685
-What is she up to?
-Nothing, okay? Can I--

450
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,020
Are you coming home?

451
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,942
Ah, the look on your face is telling me
that the answer is no!

452
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,737
And, yes,
I can hear the look on your face.

453
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,114
I'm your mother.

454
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,616
Oh my God, Ma.
They should've recruited you.

455
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,327
-[doorbell rings]
-All right. Listen, I gotta go, Mikey.

456
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,954
Give Roxanne a hug from me,

457
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,249
and don't leave your best man speech
till the last minute.

458
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,209
-Wait. Ma, I--
-[disconnection beeps]

459
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,127
[sighs]

460
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:42,838
[sighs]

461
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,840
[pensive music playing]

462
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,813
[Mike] Thanks, man.

463
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,695
I'm in.

464
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,197
Just call me the Jersey James Bond.

465
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,657
Double O "Go fuck yourself"?

466
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,325
-Exactly.
-[laughs]

467
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,829
[Rox] Normally, we'd put you through
a six-month training program

468
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,748
of everything you need to know
to be a Union agent,

469
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,542
but, unfortunately,
we only have two weeks.

470
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,794
So we're gonna have to do
the best we can, Mike.

471
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,837
[Mike groans]

472
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,131
-Any allergies?
-Nope.

473
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,257
Any phobias?

474
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,342
Heights? Spiders?

475
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,844
-Commitment?
-Nope.

476
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,512
How many fingers can fit in your anus?

477
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,307
-All right, stop.
-I'm doing a psychological profile on you.

478
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,517
What does my asshole
have to do with psychology?

479
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,269
Hmm. You should read Freud.

480
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,730
What's your relationship like
with your father?

481
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,983
Well, he's dead now,
so, you know, we argue a lot less.

482
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,818
[dynamic music playing]

483
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,905
Shit!

484
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,240
[chuckling]

485
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,410
Mike, this is, uh… You know what?
Doesn't matter what his name is.

486
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,288
-We just call him Foreman.
-Why do they call you Foreman?

487
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,582
-'Cause I used to be one.
-That makes sense.

488
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,085
Drove a forklift for an Amazon
distribution center in Fort Worth.

489
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,505
Cleared 10,000 packages an hour.

490
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,090
Then I reprogrammed
their entire computer system.

491
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,594
Doubled their productivity, made half
their management level redundant.

492
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,847
Wow. Well, thank you
for sharing your story with me.

493
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,766
[Rox] Sprint to the edge of this building.

494
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,685
If you stop before I tell you to stop,
you fail.

495
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,521
You slow down, you fail.

496
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
You take this off, you fail.

497
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,692
If you let me run off the edge
and fall to my death, do I fail?

498
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,652
You do.

499
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,654
[Mike scoffs]

500
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,783
This is just like the go-karts in Jersey.
Oh, I got this shit.

501
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,914
The shit's on the wrong side.

502
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,625
They don't have go-karts
with the wheel on this side.

503
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,543
Mike, go again.

504
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503

As far as what happened today,

743
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,367
there's at least five other groups
in this thing.

744
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,161
They'd all do whatever the hell it takes
to get that intel.

Okay, but look.
There's five other groups, right?

749
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,216
So that means
there's five other devices out there.

750
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,678
So if we can't fix ours,
then… why don't we steal another one?

00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,163
There we go. Come on. Hey, baby.

850
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,040
Tell 'em to get the med bay ready.
We're coming in now. Come on, sweetie.

851
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,167
She's dead, Frank.

852
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,842
Goddamn it!

853
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,927
[poignant music playing]

854
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,021
[suspenseful music playing]

855
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,275
Boss, we've been compromised.
You gotta get out of there.

856
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,401
Clear the building!

857
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,449
[music stops]

858
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,576
[car alarms wailing]

859
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,001
Oh shit.

860
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,920
[dramatic music playing]

861
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,806
[Frank] Could be the damn Russians again.
Revenge for the Seven Dials.

862
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,266
[Foreman] No, bro.
How'd they know about our headquarters?

863
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,435
-[Frank] Someone's got eyes on us.
-[phone buzzing]

864
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,436
Wait.

865
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,856
-It's Brennan.
-[Foreman] It's Brennan!

866
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,941
[Frank] Boss, you okay?

867
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,651
Yeah, we got it.

868
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,403
Athena… We lost her.

869
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,073
Okay.

870
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,158
You got it.

871
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,619
Bomb missed most of the control rooms.

872
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:14,373
I don't have numbers on the casualties,
but we're still on our feet, just.

873
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,499
Now what?

874
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,501
Scatter. Wait for word.

875
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,419
[inspirational music playing]

876
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,480
[door lock beeps]

877
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,400
[music fades out]

878
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:48,156
-[Mike] This is your safe house?
-Yeah, one of 'em.

879
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,833
[Mike] You okay?

880
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,669
Yup.

881
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,922
I'm sorry about your friend, Rox.

882
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,550
[poignant music playing]

883
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,343
[Mike] I'm here if you wanna talk.

884
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,806
Yeah.

885
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,066
[music fades out]

886
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,366
-I'll sleep on the chair.
-You can't sleep in the chair.

887
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,994
I can make a bed in the corner,
on the floor.

888
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,622
You can sleep in the bed, Mike.

889
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,935
[Mike] It's not really
a safe house, is it?

890
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,273
It's more like a safe room.

891
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,487
-Yeah.
-Right?

892
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,446
Yeah.

893
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,244
[Mike] You gonna hog the blankets
like you always did?

894
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,498
I didn't hog the blankets.

895
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,960
-Oh yeah, you did.
-Oh no, I didn't.

896
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:23,877
Oh, you did.

897
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,379
-No, I didn't.
-[scoffs]

898
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,008
You did. And… [softly] …you snore too.

899
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,056
I didn't snore. You snored.

900
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,725
-No, you snored. You always snored.
-No, you snored.

901
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,185
You snored.

902
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,270
-What are you, five?
-You're five.

903
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,941
Go to sleep, silly.

904
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,488
And just for the record,

905
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,408
I'm not makin' a move on you here.

906
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,244
Just for the record,

907
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:58,912
me either.

908
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,129
[anchor] Officials say
it was an electrical spark

909
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,799
that triggered the explosion
at the iconic London landmark last night.

910
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,427
Several people were taken to hospital
for their injuries,

911
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,471
but so far, there have been
no reported deaths from the accident.

912
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,016
Electrical spark?
That's the best they could come up with?

913
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,518
-Almost sounds believable, huh?
-[grunts]

914
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,147
Brennan called.
The auction's at 1800 hours. Let's get it.

915
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,773
[dramatic music playing]

916
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,735
[recorded announcement]
The next station is Queensway.

917
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,654
Please mind the gap
between the train and the platform.

918
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,060
[music fades out]

919
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,561
[Rox] Good to see you, boss.

920
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,190
Good to be seen. Some of us got lucky.

921
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,900
Yeah.

922
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,778
What's the body count?

923
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,532
Let's, uh… let's focus on that
after we punch back, okay?

924
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:18,992
Okay.

925
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,454
Well, looks like it's up and running.

926
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,664
Activated last night.
Foreman's working on it.

927
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,626
We should be able to track Quinn's signal
as soon as the auction starts,

928
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,086
but then we gotta make sure

929
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,671
the bidding lasts long enough
to get the exact location.

930
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,674
If the buy-in's five million dollars,
how much will the bidding go up to?

931
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,551
Like, enough to buy the Knicks

932
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,262
and pay somebody
to teach 'em how to play basketball.

933
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,556
Holy shit. Who's floating the cash?

934
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,557
We are.

935
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:44,935
Who are you?

936
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,061
I'm the CIA.

937
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,814
[smugly] And we're funding
tonight's little dance,

938
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,899
so if you could grab Quinn and the intel

939
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:55,403
before the US government finance
the 401K of every foreign hostile

940
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:59,574
between here and Pyongyang,
well, then we sure would appreciate it.

941
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,161
Get the intel,
you live to fight another day.

942
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,081
Screw it up, that's the Union done.

943
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,794
Where can I get a coffee around here?

944
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,630
[suspenseful music playing]

945
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,777
[Quinn] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

946
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,946
Welcome to tonight's auction.

947
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,197
Okay. Foreman.

948
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,574
[Foreman] Just started.

949
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,160
-Roxanne?
-Moving into position now.

950
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,496
-Had any disco fries today, Mike?
-Nope.

951
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,624
Great. They're not as good
the second time around.

952
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,918
-[Mike] Some things can be.
-[chuckles]

953
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,547
[Quinn] With only one item on the docket,
we'll begin bidding straightaway

954
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,175
at the opening price
of 100 million dollars.

955
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,677
-I have 100 million. 125.
-[CIA man] Hey, Bezos?

956
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,389
If you don't wanna be working a forklift
on Monday, get the damn tracker working!

957
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,600
-[Foreman] Um, almost there.
-[Frank] Come on now.

958
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,226
-[phone buzzing]
-It's my boss.

959
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,269
[Quinn] 150 million.

960
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:13,398
He probably wants to know if he needs
to sell one of the states to pay for this.

961
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,151
I think we could lose Idaho.
Nobody'd notice.

962
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,653
-I'm from Idaho.
-You think I don't know that?

963
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,114
[Rox] We got a signal yet?

964
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,242
-[Quinn] 175 million.
-[Foreman] Right. Here we go.

965
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,535
[Frank] Showtime.

966
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,080
[Foreman] Getting the lockdown
on the location. Rox, start heading east.

967
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:29,998
Got it.

968
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,252
[dramatic music playing]

969
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,009
[Quinn] 200 million dollars.

970
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,261
[Foreman] It's narrowing down
to the Southwark area.

971
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,640
[Mike yelps] A heads-up
would be nice, Rox.

972
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,477
Hold on, Mike.

973
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,980
[Quinn] 250 million.

974
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,777
Do I have 275?

975
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,075
275 million.

976
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,452
I hope you know what you're doing.

977
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,204
[Quinn] 300 million dollars.

978
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,455
Not my money.

979
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,915
[music intensifies]

980
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,878
[Quinn] 325 million.

981
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,923
[car horns blaring]

982
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,261
Do I have an advance on 325 million?

983
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,305
Do I have 350 million?

984
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,849
-Dude.
-Um, it's calibrating. I need more time.

985
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,269
-[Brennan sighs]
-[Quinn] Do I have 350?

986
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,730
-Okay
-[Quinn] 350 million dollars.

987
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,025
Do I have 375?

988
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,694
[music gradually intensifying]

989
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,948
[Quinn] Going once.

990
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,869
-[CIA man] Brennan.
-What do you want me to do? My bid is in.

991
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,330
You know how an auction works?
I can't bid against myself.

992
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:53,498
Going twice.

993
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,083
[music intensifying]

994
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,503
[Quinn] I have 375 million.

995
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,672
[Foreman] We're still alive, Rox.
Net closin' in.

996
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,883
[car horns blaring]

997
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,677
[Foreman] They're somewhere
near St. Paul's.

998
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,387
[Rox] Two minutes out.

999
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,015
Okay, we're close. We've got a location.

1000
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,976
About to locate the building.

1001
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,186
-[Quinn] 425 million.
-No. No. What happened?

1002
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,273
-Uh, shit, it's buffering.
-"Shit, it's buffering."

1003
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,066
[Rox] Where to, Foreman?

1004
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,320
This is your computer guy?
He looks like the janitor.

1005
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,988
-Can we get a young person?
-Hold on, man!

1006
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,573
-[CIA man] I'll do it myself.
-Going twice.

1007
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,909
-[CIA man] How do you work this thing?
-What are you doin'? Don't do--

1008
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,580
-[Quinn] New bid at 550 million dollars.
-Shit. I--

1009
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,332
-There goes Boise.
-[Foreman] Connection's back.

1010
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,836
-Rox, she's in Nicholls Avenue.
-[Rox] Nice job, Foreman.

1011
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,425
Roxanne?

1012
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,720
-We're closin' in.
-Right, you're a block away.

1013
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,972
[Quinn] Do I have 575 million?

1014
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,640
There! Rooftop level.

1015
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,815
["All I Need (DJ-Kicks)"
by Jayda G playing in bar]

1016
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,415
Six hundred million dollars.

1017
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,002
Do I have any advance
on six hundred million dollars?

1018
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,754
How about zero dollars,

1019
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,007
and I don't advance this bullet
through your skull?

1020
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,050
Damn.

1021
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,177
That concludes tonight's bidding.

[computer beeps]

1023
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,432
Roxanne Hall.

1024
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,395
I'm surprised they let the Union
stay involved after Trieste.

1025
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,357
After six of our people got killed,
we don't pass this to nobody else.

1026
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,652
You shouldn't let this job
get too personal. Clouds the judgment.

1027
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,195
It's all personal.

1028
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,866
Mr. Weston, how duplicitous of you.

1029
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,745
It's Mike McKenna.
Jersey branch. Where's Ricky tonight?

1030
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,872
He has his yoga class on Tuesdays.

1031
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,419
-Where's the intel, Quinn?
-You know you can call me Juliet, darling.

1032
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,047
I'll be callin' you "that bitch I buried
in London" if you don't start talkin'.

1033
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,301
You see, this is why
I hate dealing with the agencies.

1034
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,138
Everything always starts at a ten,
doesn't it?

1035
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,848
Shoulda seen her in high school.

1036
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,351
The intelligence is in a lockbox
in Holland Park.

1037
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,437
I'm… very happy to drive you.

1038
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,688
I'll drive.

1039
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,065
You're in the passenger seat.

1040
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,444
He's in the back
with a gun pointed at your head.

1041

How's that sound?

1042
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,114
Fabulous.

Yup, that's it.

1053
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,740

[softly] Roxanne,

1061
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,438
your life is in danger.

1062
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,483
All of our lives are in danger.

1063
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,862
Please… let me in.

1064

[door closes]

1065
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,586
[Quinn] Well, this evening gets
stranger and stranger.

1066
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,839
Agent Faraday… back from the dead.

1067
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,468
-Nick Faraday. Local 12-25.
-Oh, cool. You're Union.

1068
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,053
-That's right.
-Hi.

1069
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:03,016
One of the six dead agents in Trieste.
You're looking well for it.

1070
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:03,933
How?

1071
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,061
How… how are you still alive, Nick?

1072
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,272
The current carried me to the ocean.

1073
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,734
Got myself to a doctor,
then got myself here.

1074
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,486
Rox, Trieste was a setup.

1075
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,699
Someone knew we were coming.
That means there's a leak in the Union.

1076
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,745
So, what? You were just playing dead
until you figured out who it was?

1077
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,623
-That's right.
-You shoulda told me.

1078
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,751
-It was to keep you safe.
-I can keep myself safe, Nick.

1079
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,461
Gimme a name.

1080
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,965
-Tom Brennan.
-No.

1081
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,593
The stolen intel has details
on everyone who's ever worked

1082
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,220
for the US government
going back to the Cold War,

1083
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,764
including mission logs.

1084
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,475
Including classified mission logs.

1085
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,936
How much do you know about
Tom Brennan before he set up the Union?

1086
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,898
Did you know he used to run black ops
for the CIA?

1087
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,317
Tom Brennan has a history, Rox.

1088
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,445
He's done things
our government has felt compelled to bury.

1089
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,947
Things that were never meant
to see the light of day.

1090
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,242
All right, but if all that was true,
how come you didn't tell me?

1091
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,494
I was trying to protect you.

1092
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:07,789
You spent two weeks pretending to be dead.
Why should she trust you, asshole?

1093
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,874
'Cause I'm married to her, asshole.

1094
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,001
What?

1095
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,339
We're separated.

1096
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,382
Really?

1097
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,134
-This guy?
-What's that supposed to mean?

1098
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,720
I'm sure her dad was pleased as punch
when you walked in.

1099
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,430
Bill and I had a great rapport.

1100
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,642
Oh, Bill? You didn't have to call him
Mr. Hall like everybody else?

1101
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,560
Let me tell you about me and Bill.

1102
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,896
-Yeah, no, no, no, tell me.
-Hey, we're not gonna do this.

1103
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,107
They ought to call this the "Re-union."

1104
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,984
You got proof that it was Brennan?

1105
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,029
Proof is in the intel.
And it can't go to Brennan.

1106
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,823
Who do you suggest giving it to?

1107
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,992
Cameron Foster and the CIA are in London
overseeing the operation.

1108
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,119
Hand it over to them.

1109
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,705
That guy who thinks he's Gary Oldman?
He's full of shit.

1110
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,248
Listen, new guy.

1111
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,084
Why don't you bench yourself
and let the grown-ups talk, okay?

1112
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,087
This guy
had all the combat training, right?

1113
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,506
Yes, Mike. He'd beat you in a fight.

1114
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,925
All right, I'll let that slide. This time.

1115
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,928
Roxanne, I'm asking you to trust me.

1116
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,639
Brennan will kill for this intel.

1117
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,560
Too many Union agents are dead.
I don't wanna see anyone else join them.

1118
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,520
Especially not you, baby.

1119
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:17,650

Brennan.

1122
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,866
He'll have a track on your location.
We should scatter.

1123
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,826
Suppose you want the intel as well?

1124
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,454
No. The CIA can arrange a pickup.

1125
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,582
We can rendezvous
at the Albert Bridge at dawn,

1126
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,334
and we can pass it over together.
Let them handle this.

1127
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,669
What about her?

1128
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,797
Oh, darling.
No, I'm just a simple middleman.

1129
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,049
Best to cut me loose, I'd say.

1130
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,259
Let me handle her.

Uh-uh. We're not gonna do that.

You didn't wanna tell me you were married?

B, I thought he was dead.

Yeah, like ten minutes
before you came to see me.

You drive right to the bar
after the funeral?

-Why would that matter to you?
-You know why it matters to me!

1143
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,074
Do you care that I've been married
to somebody in the last 25 years?

1144
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,742
To that asshole? A little bit. I do.

1145
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,204
Okay. What was that shit about my dad?
"Oh, I bet you call him Mr. Hall."

Like somehow as if my dad was the problem.

If you wanna talk about it, let's talk.

1148
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,877
Your father had a problem
because you had a Black girlfriend.

1149
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,504
Your dad didn't like me either.

1150
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,589
They were being protective.
They were old-fashioned.

1151
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,384
Old-fashioned. Let me pull out
my appropriate racism chart,

1152
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,971
and let's see where old-fashioned falls
between small-town housewife

and Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan!

1154
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,437
My dad was an asshole.
I should've said something.

1155
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,439
-Yeah.
-I shoulda done a lot, and I didn't.

1156
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,359
But you shoulda told me the truth
before manipulating me into coming here!

1157
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,028
I didn't manipulate you. I saved you!

1158
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,948
I came and dragged you
out of your small, little life.

1159
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,284
-"My small, little life." Yeah, well.
-Yeah.

1160
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,452
I gave you an opportunity
to be a part of something.

1161
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,789
I gotta tell you, Rox.
It might not be perfect, but it's honest.

1162
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,960
Yeah. I live in the same house.
I got the same job and the same friends.

1163
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,754
And you know why?
'Cause I can count on them.

1164
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,299
They'd lie in traffic for me.
I'd do the same for them!

1165
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,927
Can you say that about the people
that you have in your life? I doubt it.

-[Johnny] Hey, man! Look who it is!
-Mikey!

1183
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,136
-Yeah!
-[Ronnie] That's my best man!

1184
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,598
Ronnie, I promise you, I'm gonna be there
for the wedding, okay? I promise.

1185
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,642
I'm never gonna forgive you, man!

1186
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,268
[Mike] Keep your pants on.

1187
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:24,563
I'm kidding! I'm kidding, bro.
We love you, buddy.

1188
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,566
Hey, whatever you're doin',
it's gotta be important, right?

1189
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,609
-[Johnny] Yeah!
-Right.

1190
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,945
-[Ronnie] You do you, Mikey!
-[men whooping]

1191
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,197
[whooping stops]

1192
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,617
Sorry about that.

1193
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,538
[rousing music playing]

1194
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,521
[music subsides]

1195
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,232
[music becomes poignant]

1196
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,921
What are you doin' here, Mike?

1197
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,050
The mission ain't over.
I ain't goin' home.

1198
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,179
-You're still an asshole.
-Oh, you've always been an asshole.

1199
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,223
-[chuckles] Thanks for coming, Mike.
-No problem.

1200
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,892
I would have got here a lot sooner,

1201
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,478
but I was standing on the wrong bridge
for 20 minutes.

1202
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,397
He should be here.

1203
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,483
[intriguing music playing]

1204
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,447
[cell phone buzzing]

1205
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,124
So I'm on the bridge, Nick,
and you're not here.

1206
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,919
I'm guessing this isn't gonna be
great news, is it?

1207
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:13,756
-Afraid I'm not coming, Rox.
-Oh, what? So this was a setup?

1208
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,007
You and Brennan.

1209
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,302
If you check your bank balance,
you'll see a parting gift

1210
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:21,347
of a quarter of the proceeds
from the buy-in to the auction.

1211
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,308
I had to, uh, cover my escape.

1212
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,768
What about the intel?

1213
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,729
The bags switched back at the house.

1214
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:32,274
I mean, the Iranians did promise
good money for it.

1215
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,111
Wouldn't be fair
to leave 'em empty-handed.

1216
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,780
And the Union? No loyalty, Nick?

1217
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,948
Yeah, the Union.

1218
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,158
It sounds good in the beginning, you know?

1219
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:45,621
Then you save the world a few times,
and there's no credit and no reward.

1220
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:49,083
Brennan's blue-collar bullshit
really started to piss me off

1221
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:52,670
right around the time my wife decided
she'd had enough of me

1222
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,548
just because… I wanted more.

1223
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,468
You didn't have to kill Athena
or bomb the London branch.

1224
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,471
I would've stopped at Trieste
if you guys hadn't been so persistent.

1225
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,348
And I was content to play dead forever,

1226
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:07,059
but once you got the Koreans' device,
I had to take the Union out.

1227
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,228
Or you and Brennan
would never stop coming after me.

1228
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,646
You're right about that.

1229
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,566
And that would've
cramped my style, Roxanne.

1230
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:15,943
And we wouldn't want that.

1231
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,236
[helicopter approaching]

1232
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,572
-Well, that's disappointing.
-Roxanne.

1233
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,245
Look here, Nick.

1234
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,206
In the history of men screwin' up,

1235
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,418
you might have just screwed up the worst.

1236
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,545
Hmm.

1237
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,213
I'll be seeing you, baby.

1238
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,633
-[music becomes tense]
-[tires screech]

1239
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,136
[music intensifies]

1240
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,065
Drop the intel. Hit the ground now.

1241
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,776
Come on, Foster.
You can't possibly think all this is real.

1242
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,362
Agent Hall. Agent…

1243
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,281
Mike!

1244
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,493
Agent Mike, you got five seconds
before we open fire!

1245
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:09,413
-Look, when I say go, follow me.
-Follow you? Where?

1246
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,665
-Remember the trust exercise?
-Yeah.

1247
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,042
-Did I let you die?
-[Foster] Two.

1248
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,585
-Shit. Yeah.
-Remember that.

1249
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:18,172
That shiner, is that what Brennan gave you
while you were handcuffin' him?

1250
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:20,549
Yeah, I know.
He's quite fast for an old man.

1251
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,760
Maybe prison will slow him down.

1252
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,304
Yeah, well, he taught me
everything I know.

1253
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,097
[music intensifies]

1254
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:29,808
Go!

1255
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,685
[music becomes dramatic]

1256
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,272
[Foster] Shit!

1257
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,110
Oh! Goddamn! Come on! Get out of my way!

1258
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:52,289
I want that goddamned son of a bitch boat
pulled over! No one gets off!

1259
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,291
[loud-hailer] Please halt your vessel.

1260
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,045
Sir, please pull your vessel to the shore.

1261
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,881
You have known fugitives on board.

1262
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,180
[music gradually fades out]

1263
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,975
There's Faraday. Right there.

1264
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,145
-Oh, you put a track on him?
-Yeah, I put a track on him.

1265
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,106
I might be an asshole, but I'm not stupid.

1266
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,526
-I didn't mean that. I was just…
-I know. Forget it.

1267
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:21,944
[Mike] Istria?

1268
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,489
Yup. But the truth is, Mike,
the Union is out of the game.

1269
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,991
We're on the run from the CIA.

1270
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,952
Every cop and every agent in London
is looking for you,

1271
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,914
and if you get caught, you're looking
at hard time for treason, so, you know…

1272
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,668
Look, I'm not worried about it, all right?
I'm in it as long as you're in.

1273
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,717
Okay. All we need to do now
is figure out how we get on a plane.

1274
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,968
[cell phone ringing]

1275
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,928
[man] Are you insane? Ah.

1276
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,346
[vendor] Bobby!

1277
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,892
-What the hell? Where you been?
-[Mike] Hey, hey, Bobby.

1278
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,811
No bullshit, I swear to Christ.

1279
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,813
Roxanne, she kidnaps me,

1280
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,275
she makes me join some secret agency
to fight terrorists in London.

1281
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,986
Ha-ha. Real funny, asshole.
You had us worried.

1282
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:06,488
Ronnie's getting married on Sunday.
You gotta be here.

1283
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,659
I need a favor. Are you still coordinating
all the cargo flights going out of Newark?

1284
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,746
Right. Nothin' leaves the airport
without me knowin' about it.

1285
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,122
What do you need?

1286
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:18,292
You stupid? I need to leave an airport
without anybody knowing.

1287
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,336
[suspenseful music playing]

1288
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,183
-Gary?
-Yeah.

1289
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,769
[lock rattling]

1290
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,397
Container 726.
Tell Bobby he owes me, yeah?

1291
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,482
I'll do that.

1292
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,454
[Mike] Hey, here.

1293
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,359
[music subsides]

1294
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,822
Does this remind you of something?

1295
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,782
Think about it.

1296
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,702
Janitor's closet… by the gym.

1297
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,912
That's the one.

1298
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,831
-Eighth grade.
-Yeah.

1299
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,667
[both chuckle softly]

1300
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,127
[music intensifies]

1301
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,607
[music ends]

1302
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:07,276
Hey.

1303
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,069
Foster.

1304
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,866
I assume you're sitting in your office
having a nice chai latte

1305
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,534
and listening in on this,

1306
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,328
so I know you
and the whole Central Incompetence Agency

1307
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,790
think I'm behind this,
and somehow, Roxanne Hall is involved

1308
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,543
and, of course, as usual,
you've got it dead wrong.

1309
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,963
So now the Union is on ice, and meanwhile,

1310
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,924
the real bad guys, dollars to doughnuts,

1311
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:34,928
they're selling your stolen intelligence
right this goddamn minute.

1312
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,181
And you know what happens next?

1313
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:42,019
An old flame of mine
runs a CIA office in Istanbul.

1314
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:46,607
She'll be driving her grandkids
to soccer practice

1315
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,401
when the whole car's blown to smithereens

1316
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,571
because some terrorist cell
got her home address

1317
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,283
and the-- and the make and model
of her car from your stolen intel!

1318
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,495
Every agency, every employee,

1319
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:03,373
from the bigwigs to the regular Joes,
are gonna be droppin' like flies.

1320
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,501
You ready for that, Foster?

1321
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,628
'Cause this is coming down on your head.

1322
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,381
You better pray what's left of my team
can find that intel

1323
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:12,966
before somebody else does.

1324
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,931
It's not that I think it's small.

1325
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,058
Excuse me?

1326
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,810
Your life… in Paterson.

1327
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:26,188
You know, what I said in the car?

1328
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,025
I don't think that your life
has been small.

1329
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:30,943
Oh.

1330
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:37,824
You know, I just needed to get out
and see what else was out there, you know?

1331
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,535
I get that.

1332
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,373
Was it everything you wanted it to be?

1333
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,542
Sometimes.

1334
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,086
Sometimes, no.

1335
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:57,844
You know, I don't… know
if we definitely get out of this.

1336
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,847
We might not win this one,

1337
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,351
but I'm glad it's you and me.

1338
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,273
And I'm really glad
I walked back into that bar.

1339
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,956
Oh, welcome to Istria. Oh-ho!

1340
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,542
-I read my travel guide on the way.
-[man chuckles]

1341
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,838
Everywhere you go,
there's a Bobby Breslin, huh?

1342
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,340
[tense music playing]

1343
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,221
[engine starts]

1344
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,433
-See you're still good at it.
-It's all in the wrist.

1345
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,446
Well, he always said
he wanted to sail around the world.

1346
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,990
Looks like he's gonna get his chance.

1347
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,285
You two ever go on vacation together?

1348
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,162
-Nope.
-Honeymoon?

1349
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,121
Uh-uh.

1350
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:11,460
You ever go anywhere nice just to,
I don't know, hang out, go for a swim?

1351
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,711
Not shoot somebody?

1352
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,380
Nope. Never.

1353
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,300
It's worth thinkin' about.

1354

1355

1358

You okay, Rox? You cool?

1359
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,957
Yeah. I'm cool. Don't I look cool?

1360
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,919
Well, you always look cool, but… Oh shit.

1361
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:00,967
That was either
the president of Croatia's motorcade--

1362
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:03,720
Or the deal for the intel
is about to go down.

1367
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,705

1368

[server] Thank you.

1372
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,255
You brought bodyguards?

1373
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,591
Well, not as many as you.

1374
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:46,179
You must treat with caution a man
who is willing to betray his friends.

1375
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,848
The Union weren't my friends.

1376
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,516
They were my employers.

1377
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,811
And now I'm freelance, so let's do this.

1378
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,856

Let's finish this quickly.

we can complete the transaction.

Once the intel is verified,
we can complete the payment.

1383
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,295
[Rox] Well, well, well.

1384
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,505
-What are the odds, huh?
-[guns cocking]

1385
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,551
You made a big mistake, Roxanne.

1386
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:25,761
[Rox chuckles]

1387
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,764
-[man 1] Who is this?
-[Quinn] This is Nick's former partner.

1388
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,599
Professional and personal.

1389
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,393
-Hello, Rox.
-Hello, Juliet.

1390
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,437
-Do we have a problem here?
-No.

1391
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,273
Oh, we absolutely have a problem here.

1392
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,778
Any quarrel you have with Mr. Faraday
has nothing to do with me.

1393
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,446
Okay, look here.

1394
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,240
If you wanna sit at the big kids' table

1395
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,702
and buy stolen secrets
from an ex-secret agent, fine by me,

1396
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,037
but what we're not gonna do

1397
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,081
is sit here and pretend
like you don't know what you're doing.

1398
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,918
So what do you want, Rox?

1399
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,838
I want you to go to prison
for murder, espionage, and treason.

1400
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,717
-Roxanne.
-I'm taking you both in right now.

1401
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,845
-It appears we have a complication.
-I can assure you--

1402
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,139
Your assurances are worth very little now.

1403
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,143
I'm afraid I must treat this
as the conclusion of our negotiations.

1404
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,605
[dramatic music playing]

1405
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,982

Remove your hand!

01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,361
[in Farsi] Get the intel!

1407
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,074
Get his bag!

1408
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,747
It's a sad day when you can't even trust
an Iranian terror cell, huh?

1409
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,792
Like I said, Rox,
you made a big mistake coming here.

1410
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,920
Oh, my big mistake was marrying you.
Coming here was just reckless.

1411
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,046
I guess it was.

1412
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,590
-Kill her.
-[Quinn] Wait.

1413
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,219
Nick, darling.

1414
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:54,307
This was fun, but now it feels messy,
and that's just not me.

1415
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:56,643
What are you talkin' about?

1416
01:20:56,726 --> 01:21:00,313
I think maybe the best thing for us
will be to have a little break. Hm?

1417
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,733
-Chance for the dust to settle.
-[in disbelief] Juliet.

1418
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:08,697
Roxanne, if you live through this,
I'm sure you'll come after me.

1419
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,073
Oh, you can count on it.

1420
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:13,201
[Quinn] Yes. Well, remember
that I spared your life

1421
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,413
and consider that I might be
more useful to you out in the field.

1422
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,999
I expect we'll meet again.

1423
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,544
Nick, I suspect we probably won't.

1424
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,340

You're just gonna shoot me in cold blood?

-Five dead in Trieste?
-They were collateral damage.

1431
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:48,570
Oh, you're making this
easier and easier for me.

1432
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,280

Oh, I don't think that's gonna happen.

I could have taken you out in Trieste,
but I didn't.
