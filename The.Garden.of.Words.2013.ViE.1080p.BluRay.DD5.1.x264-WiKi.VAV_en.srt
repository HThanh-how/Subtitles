00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,870
Until I entered high school two months ago, </i>

3
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,870
I didn't know...</i>

4
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,210
The dampness of my uniform's hem, </i>

5
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,210
soaked by someone else's umbrella...</i>

6
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,510
The smell of naphthalene, </i>

7
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,510
clinging to someone's suit...</i>

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,930
The warm body pushed up against my back...</i>

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,890
The chill breeze of the air conditioner</i>

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,890
against my face...</i>

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,810
- Shinjuku... Shinjuku station...</i>

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,810
- Thank you for riding with us.</i>

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,730
When I was little the sky was closer...</i>

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,730
So much closer.</i>

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,950
That's why I like the rain, </i>

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,950
as with it comes the smell of the sky.</i>

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,450
And often, on rainy mornings, </i>

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,450
instead of transferring to the subway, </i>

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,450
I exit out the station gates.</i>

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,540
June

21
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,030
Chocolate, and... beer?</i>

22
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,580
But, I think I've seen her somewhere...</i>

23
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,420
- Here.

24
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,420
- Thank you.

25
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,350
U-Um... Have we met before?

26
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,770
N-No.

27
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,980
I'm sorry, my mistake.

28
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,400
It's okay.

29
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,670
Maybe it's fitting...

30
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,130
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite

31
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,130
(A faint clap of thunder)

32
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,180
sashi kumori

33
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,180
(Clouded skies)

34
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,930
ame mo furanu ka?

35
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,930
(Perhaps rain comes)

36
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,970
kimi wo todomemu

37
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,970
(If so, will you stay here with me?)

38
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:56,830
THE GARDEN OF WORDS

39
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,260
This morning, the JMA has declared the start of</i>

40
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,260
the rainy season in Kyushu, </i>

41
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,480
5 days earlier than average.</i>

42
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,980
Nagasaki, Saga, Kumamoto, </i>

43
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,980
and Kagoshima prefectures</i>

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
expect strong rains over a wide area.</i>

45
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm home.

46
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
Welcome home.

47
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,330
I bought croquettes.

48
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,370
Great. Dinner will be ready soon.

49
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,830
Thank you.

50
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,960
Where's Ma?

51
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,210
Ran out.

52
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,840
Lucky us, we get all the croquettes

53
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,840
to ourselves.

54
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,010
She left a letter saying not to go

55
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,010
looking for her.

56
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,850
But maybe...

57
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Leave her be.

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,230
I'm sure she'll be back after fighting

59
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,230
with her boyfriend.

60
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,400
I've picked out a place.

61
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,400
I'll be leaving next month.

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,730
Living alone?

63
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,400
With my girlfriend.

64
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,740
Don't think that's why mom ran out?

65
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,030
You told her yesterday, right?

66
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,870
I wish she could just let her children go,

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,870
you know?

68
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,740
She's the one who's making the rounds

69
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,740
dating younger men, damn it.

70
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,710
Oh, yeah? Well then I'm gonna go live

71
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,710
with my boyfriend!

72
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,590
She's got those youthful looks, after all.</i>

73
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,090
That's 'cause she's never worked hard</i>

74
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,090
her entire life.</i>

75
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,920
You're the one who's been piling on the years.

76
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,430
All done.

77
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,430
You do the dishes. I've aged enough.

78
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,440
Won't you be glad to have more space?

79
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,570
'suppose so.

80
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,610
Help me move, 'kay?

81
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,740
Sure.

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,740
Hey, have you heard of this?

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,750
What is this, a haiku?

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,290
It's a tanka.

85
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,920
As if.

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,290
Ask Ma when she gets back.

87
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,900
On sunny mornings, I transfer to the subway and</i>

88
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,900
head here, like I'm supposed to.</i>

89
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,940
But I think to myself</i>

90
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,940
"This is not what I should be doing now."</i>

91
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,500
Rain...

92
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,850
Hello.

93
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,390
Hello.

94
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,050
Hey...

95
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,430
No school today?

96
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,730
And your office... Is it closed today?

97
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm skipping work again...

98
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,740
And drinking beer in the park in the morning.

99
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,740
Drinking beer alone isn't good for

100
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,740
your health.

101
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,410
You need to eat something with it.

102
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
You know a lot for a high school kid.

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,410
It's not me. My mom's the drinker.

104
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,750
I've got snack food.

105
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,000
Want some?

106
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
You just thought to yourself

107
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
"This woman's a freak, " didn't you?

108
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,220
No, I...

109
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,560
lt's okay. We're human, after all.

110
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,560
We've all got our little quirks.

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,980
Maybe...

112
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,270
Definitely.

113
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,240
Okay, it's about time for me to go.

114
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,790
Heading to school now?

115
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,960
I've decided to only skip school

116
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,960
on rainy mornings.

117
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,250
Then, maybe we'll see each other again.

118
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,090
Perhaps, when it's raining.

119
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,300
It was the first day of Kanto's rainy season.</i>

120
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,480
Entrance Exam

121
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,270
About Tuition

122
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,190
A shoemaker?

123
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,320
I know it seems out of touch,

124
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,870
but I enjoy creating designs and making shoes.

125
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,830
Of course, I'm still terrible at it.

126
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,870
Of course...

127
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,670
But despite it all, </i>

128
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,670
I want to make it my career... if I can.</i>

129
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,050
I've never told anyone this before.</i>

130
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,260
Do you have any idea how late you are?

131
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,770
You know why I've called you here, right?

132
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,650
Hey...

133
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,750
Evenings, before I went to sleep...</i>

134
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Mornings, in the moment I woke up...</i>

135
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,340
I realized I was praying for rain.</i>

136
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,810
I realized that on sunny days, </i>

137
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,810
I was in a terrible, childish place.</i>

138
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,890
With nothing but impatience.</i>

139
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,780
She exists in a world of working adults, </i>

140
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,780
so very far away from me...</i>

141
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,740
To me she represents nothing less</i>

142
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,740
than the very secrets of the world.</i>

143
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,410
Honestly, there are only two things</i>

144
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,410
I know for sure.</i>

145
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,250
One: She must think of me and my</i>

146
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,250
15years as just some mere kid.</i>

147
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:43,930
And two: Making shoes is the only thing</i>

148
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:43,930
that will lead me out of this place.</i>

149
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,320
Please stay behind the yellow line</i>

150
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,320
foryour safety.</i>

151
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,420
Please be careful of the closing doors.</i>

152
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,070
Good morning.

153
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,700
I thought you might not come today.

154
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,530
It's a miracle you haven't been fired yet.

155
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,330
Wow! Is that a shoe design?

156
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,750
Hey!

157
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,880
I can't see?

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,550
It's not something worth showing.

159
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,380
Really?

160
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,630
Yes, really.

161
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,840
Come on, sit down over there.

162
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm going to eat breakfast.

163
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,940
Would you like to join me?

164
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,860
Okay, but I've brought my own.

165
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,730
You made it yourself?

166
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,820
What? I cook sometimes, you know.

167
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,030
Oh?

168
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,530
Then let's make a trade.

169
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
Wait, I'm not really that good a...

170
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,750
...cook, you know.

171
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,170
It's your own fault.

172
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,260
That's a side of you I didn't expect.

173
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,550
What?

174
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,760
Sorry. But it's tasty in its own way.

175
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,890
It's got... bite.

176
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,270
Don't patronize me.

177
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,180
Can I have another?

178
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,780
Hurry up!

179
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,450
Wait, bro!

180
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,620
Takao, be careful.

181
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,870
Happy birthday, Mom!

182
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,290
Thank you.

183
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,960
What could the three of you have gotten me?

184
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,490
Hey... Do you think it's too late for me?

185
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,520
And you know what?

186
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,520
I could actually taste the food.

187
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,150
So your taste disorder has improved?</i>

188
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,520
I wouldn't go that far.

189
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,990
But just a little while ago, all I could taste

190
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,990
was alcohol and chocolate.

191
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,030
I think you deciding to just quit</i>

192
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,030
was really for the best.</i>

193
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,200
Maybe so.

194
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,380
You speak to me so gently, </i>

195
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,380
like you're touching something fragile.</i>

196
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,220
But back then, when I found it hard</i>

197
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,220
even to breathe, </i>

198
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,720
you didn't believe me. You only listened to</i>

199
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,720
the voices around you.</i>

200
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,850
Then we'll start the paperwork</i>

201
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,850
foryou leaving after the holiday.</i>

202
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,850
I'll notify the higher-ups.</i>

203
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,940
Okay. Sorry to cause you all this trouble

204
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,940
even after we split up.

205
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,900
I'm glad, really...</i>

206
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,570
About that old woman you met.

207
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,740
You know, the one you keep talking about

208
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,740
who brings her lunch box to the park.

209
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
It seems like you've really struck a chord.

210
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,910
Yeah, get some rest.

211
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,720
Ever since then...</i>

212
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,220
...I've been nothing but lies.

213
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,740
Rain...

214
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,370
It's raining again today in Kanto.</i>

215
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,370
Here at Shinjuku Station's south exit, </i>

216
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,370
the commuters all have umbrellas in their hands.</i>

217
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,510
July

218
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,850
Here, this is for you.

219
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,100
For me?

220
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I've always ended up

221
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
eating your food, see...

222
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,900
And you said you wanted it, right?

223
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,990
This book isn't cheap...

224
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,860
Thank you... very much.

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
It's my pleasure.

226
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,120
Um...

227
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm actually making a pair of shoes right now.

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,300
Wow... A pair for yourself?

229
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,640
I haven't decided whose shoes yet...

230
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,640
They're women's shoes.

231
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,890
But, I haven't been able to

232
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,890
get them right, and...

233
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,090
You know... Before I knew it,

234
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,930
I wasn't able to walk properly anymore.

235
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,220
Are you talking about your job?

236
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,020
Yeah... About a lot of things.

237
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
I don't know anything about her.</i>

238
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,110
Herjob, her age...</i>

239
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,110
What worries she carries...</i>

240
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,740
Even her name...</i>

241
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,780
And yet I can't help but be charmed by her.</i>

242
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,720
The rainy season is officially over 10 days</i>

243
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,720
later than normal in the Kanto region.</i>

244
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,140
The current temperature in the city</i>

245
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,140
is 26 degrees.</i>

246
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,980
Like someone just flicked a switch, </i>

247
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,980
the sunny days came one after another.</i>

248
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,450
Oh sure, now I think to myself</i>

249
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,450
"I'm glad that he's not skipping class anymore"...</i>

250
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,660
But in reality...</i>

251
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,460
...I wish the rainy season had never ended.

252
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,850
This park sure is big.

253
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,970
I can't believe we're in Shinjuku.

254
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,350
Oh, pardon us.

255
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,020
Go ahead.

256
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,520
This is the Japanese gardens, right?

257
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,650
Where should we go next?

258
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,360
Isn't there a greenhouse?

259
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's check it out.

260
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,320
It's like a totally different place</i>

261
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,320
on sunny days.</i>

262
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,500
Thanks for the help.

263
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,210
Hey, why don't you eat dinner with us, Takao?

264
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,040
Sorry, but I've got my part-time job today.

265
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,500
This late?

266
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,670
And I don't want to impose.

267
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,970
The opposite! I'm going to be living with him

268
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,970
from now on, so just this once...

269
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,680
I can hear you.

270
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,180
Well then, see you later.

271
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,770
He's a cute kid.

272
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,850
Did you notice his shoes?

273
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
They're handmade.

274
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,480
What? Seriously?

275
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,730
Just some ugly moccasins, though.

276
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,730
He's got a bright future, doesn't he?

277
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,030
I wonder if he'd make shoes for me?

278
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,700
Who knows? Teenagers' interests

279
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,700
change on a whim...

280
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,580
My brother moved out, and</i>

281
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,580
the rainless days continued.</i>

282
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,240
I had no excuse to head to that place.</i>

283
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,250
August

284
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
And then, it was summer vacation.</i>

285
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,860
I worked part-time almost</i>

286
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,860
every day over the summer.</i>

287
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,900
Hmm, maybe chicken with cashew nuts?

288
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,950
Looks good to me.

289
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,610
- We'll order it.

290
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,610
- Thank you very much.

291
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,240
I wanted to earn what I could</i>

292
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,240
for tuition to a vocational school.</i>

293
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,450
Tools and leather cost money, too.</i>

294
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,960
Sure, I missed her, but...</i>

295
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,130
I think it's clinging to those feelings</i>

296
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,130
that is keeping me a little kid.</i>

297
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:03,270
That's why I've decided to create shoes</i>

298
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:03,270
that'll make her want to get up and walk.</i>

299
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,980
What~ will the weather~ be tomorrow~?</i>

300
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm not a bit smarter at the age of27</i>

301
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,500
than I was at the age of 15.</i>

302
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,170
I've always been here, </i>

303
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,170
stuck in the same place.</i>

304
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:12,420
September

305
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,470
It's just like Tsukishima...

306
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,760
to have got that confused for a week!

307
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,720
English class is no big deal.

308
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,770
That's cause Kiso's a pushover.

309
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,610
Akizuki!

310
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,360
Hey, long time no see.

311
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,360
Looks like you guys got a tan.

312
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,530
Yeah, we went to the beach a bunch.

313
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,570
You're still as pale as ever.

314
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,910
What'd you do over summer break?

315
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,030
Worked the whole time.

316
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
The whole time?

317
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,080
That's a lonely way to spend

318
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,080
your high school days.

319
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,750
School, part-time job, housework.

320
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,750
School, part-time job, housework.

321
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,210
I skip school sometimes!

322
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,260
Now that you mention it,

323
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,260
you are late a lot, Akizuki.

324
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,880
Yup, this guy never shows up

325
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,880
for 1st period when it rains.

326
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,600
I've got a condition where I can't ride

327
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,600
the subway on rainy mornings.

328
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,720
Whatever, weirdo.

329
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,470
Teacher's Office

330
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,900
Miss Yukino?

331
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,400
Miss Yukino!

332
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,950
Sato...

333
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,780
Miss Yukino...

334
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,910
Sato, save it for later.

335
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,780
Miss Yukino!

336
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,950
- Same goes for the rest of you.

337
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,950
- I'm sorry, everyone.

338
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,580
I'll be here until after 5th period.

339
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,250
After that, I'd be happy to.

340
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,210
Yuki came to school?

341
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,140
You didn't hear about Yuki quittin'?

342
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,720
No. I didn't even know who she is.

343
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,980
You have old man Takehara for lit, right?

344
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,650
Yuki was always having trouble

345
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,650
with the 3rd year girls.

346
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,740
Yeah, but Miss Yukino

347
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,740
didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,620
Someone's boyfriend fell for Miss Yukino,

349
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,160
and as payback everyone in the class

350
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,160
treated Miss Yukino terribly.

351
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,330
They spread so many rumors

352
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,330
even her parents heard about them.

353
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,790
It went so far she couldn't

354
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,790
come to school any more.

355
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,390
Yuki's just too kind. She should have

356
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,390
brought it right to the police.

357
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,560
We told Mr. Ito again and again!

358
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,850
But he didn't want to make trouble

359
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,850
for the school in public.

360
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,190
Hey, what's the matter?

361
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,690
Those upperclassmen...

362
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,490
Do you know their names?

363
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,500
Miss Yukino!

364
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,630
He totally sucks at it.

365
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,050
You're so cruel.

366
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,050
But man, you sure go through 'em.

367
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,900
What do you want, frosh?

368
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,230
Are you the 3rd year, Aizawa?

369
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,570
An admirer?

370
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,070
Who the hell are you?

371
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,070
It seems like Miss Yukino is quitting.

372
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,030
Huh?

373
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,450
Like I care about what happens to

374
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,450
that slutty hag.

375
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,870
Who does this guy think he is?

376
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,250
Huh? What's this?

377
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,920
What's your deal?

378
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,640
Let's go tell a teacher...

379
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,430
Never seen this kid before.

380
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,390
Who are you? Fallen for that old hag?

381
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,560
What a creep! Does he even know

382
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,560
how old she is?

383
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,270
Poor guy, she must have tricked him.

384
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,770
She might go for him now, though.

385
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,110
Since she ain't a teacher no more.

386
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,150
Damn straight.

387
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,030
You should thank us.

388
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,270
I'm waiting for the rain.</i>

389
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,690
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite

390
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,690
(A faint clap of thunder)

391
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,320
furazu to mo

392
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,320
(Even if rain comes not)

393
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,820
warewa tomaramu

394
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,820
(I will stay here)

395
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,490
imoshi todomeba

396
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,490
(Together with you)

397
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,870
Yes, that's the correct answer.

398
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,170
That's the right response to the tanka

399
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,170
I told you when we first met.

400
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,710
If it rains, I wonder if you will be staying here?

401
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,840
In response to that verse, I answer...

402
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,550
Even if it doesn't rain, I will be here.

403
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,850
It was in the classic Japanese

404
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,850
literature textbook.

405
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,600
Miss Yukino...

406
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,230
I'm sorry...

407
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,200
I thought you would realize

408
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,200
I was a classic literature teacher.

409
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,910
I mean, everyone at school knows about me.

410
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,580
But you're always off in your

411
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,580
own little world, aren't you?

412
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,750
Hey, what happened to your face?

413
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,210
I was acting like you

414
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,210
and drank too much beer.

415
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,920
Then I tripped and fell on the

416
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,920
Yamanote line platform.

417
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:27,920
Oh, my!

418
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,720
Just kidding. I got in a fight, that's all.

419
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,930
Look... It looks like we just

420
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,930
swam across the river.

421
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,080
I think this might...</i>

422
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,750
... this might be...</i>

423
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,420
... the happiest...</i>

424
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,260
... time of my life.</i>

425
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,430
Yukino...

426
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Yes?

427
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,940
I think I've fallen in love with you.

428
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,920
Not Yukino... Miss Yukino, remember?

429
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
I'm going to be moving next week.

430
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,980
Back to my hometown in Shikoku.

431
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,610
I made the decision a while back.

432
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,660
I was practicing how to walk on my own,

433
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,660
there in that place.

434
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,290
Even if I'm barefoot...

435
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,960
So then...

436
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,630
So I want to thank you for

437
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,630
everything, Akizuki.

438
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,520
Um, thank you for lending me these clothes.

439
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,810
I'll get changed now.

440
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,690
But yours aren't...

441
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:27,060
Excuse me... I'm going home.

442
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,890
Thank you for your hospitality.

443
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,430
I made this lunch for myself, </i>

444
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,430
but I made too much.</i>

445
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,470
So if you'd like...</i>

446
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I haven't decided whose shoes yet...</i>

447
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,690
They're women's shoes.</i>

448
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,900
I was acting like you</i>

449
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,900
and drank too much beer</i>

450
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,480
Then I tripped and fell on the</i>

451
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,480
Yamanote line platform.</i>

452
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,530
Narukami no sukoshi toyomite</i>

455

458
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,590
Um...

459
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,340
Yukino, please forget what I said earlier.

460
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,220
I was wrong... I hate you after all.

461
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,190
Ever since we first met, you struck me...

462
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,400
...like a person I should avoid.

463
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,030
Drinking beer in the morning,

464
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,030
spouting off some random tanka at me...

465
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,030
You listen all day to other people talking,

466
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,990
yet never say a peep about yourself...

467
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,500
You knew I was a student, didn't you?

468
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,540
That's just unfair!

469
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,880
If I'd known you were a teacher,

470
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,880
I would have never told you about the shoes.

471
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,670
After all, you think

472
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,670
I'll never amount to anything!

473
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,340
So why didn't you say anything to me?

474
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,720
You thought maybe you'd humor

475
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,720
the little kid's fantasies for a while?

476
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,060
Tell me I'll never live up

477
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,060
to my expectations!

478
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,690
Tell me I'll never measure up to my dreams!

479
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,270
You knew from the very beginning!

480
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,730
So tell me, god damn it!

481
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,030
Tell me I'm in your way!

482
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,530
Tell me that little kids should

483
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,530
run along to school!

484
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,240
Tell me that you hate me!

485
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
You...

486
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,830
It's because you act like that!

487
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
You never say what's important!

488
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,250
You pretend it's none of your business!

489
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,250
You've been living your whole life, alone!!

490
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,760
Every morning!

491
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,060
Every morning I put on my suit

492
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,060
to go to school...

493
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,980
But I was... scared...

494
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,940
I just couldn't go...

495
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,280
In that place...

496
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,740
You...

497
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,750
You... saved me!

498
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:29,590
I lived on with feelings frozen, </i>

499
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:29,590
never expressed in words, </i>

500
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:39,770
And I clumsily held you in my</i>

501
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:39,770
arms on a rainy night</i>

502
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:50,030
Street flyers and broken lamps, </i>

503
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:50,030
everybody was rushing back</i>

504
00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:00,500
It's not you but me who is to blame.</i>

505
00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:00,500
I couldn't hide my own impulsiveness</i>

506
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:11,460
Lady, you started running through</i>

507
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:11,460
a deserted station</i>

508
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,550
Unconcerned about getting soaked</i>

509
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,550
from the pouring rain</i>

510
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,810
The sight of you splashing through</i>

511
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,810
puddles disappears</i>

512
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Morning comes quicker in the back alleys, </i>

513
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
so I have to get hold of you now</i>

514
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,360
To say, Don't go away, don't go away</i>

515
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,200
Summer ended, and it came time to</i>

516
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,200
switch to our winter uniforms...</i>

517
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,330
I got terrible marks on my final exams...</i>

518
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,830
I wasted who knows how many</i>

519
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,830
pieces of expensive leather...</i>

520
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,500
I worked part-time over winter break as well...</i>

521
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,340
And every time I added a layer</i>

522
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,340
to my clothing, </i>

523
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,840
I wondered to myself...</i>

524
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,840
how was she doing?</i>

525
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,510
I don't have enough strength anymore</i>

To grab onto the sky that's welled up with tears</i>

529
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:13,230
You are strong enough not to feel hurt</i>

530
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:13,230
because of my unchanging heart</i>

my eyes for a moment</i>

I have known you too much, just like</i>

the night when we first quarreled, </i>

I was practicing how to walk, too.</i>

588
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,760
I think that now.</i>

589
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,100
One day, when I can walk</i>

590
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,100
much farther on my own...</i>

591
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,900
... I will go see her.</i>
