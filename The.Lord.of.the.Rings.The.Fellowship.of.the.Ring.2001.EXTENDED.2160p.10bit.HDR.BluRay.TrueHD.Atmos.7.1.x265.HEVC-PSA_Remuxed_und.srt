1
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,425
<i>Much that once was</i>

6
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>is lost.</i>

7
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,288
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,381
<i>And nine</i>

14
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,593
<i>nine rings were gifted to the race of Men</i>

15
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,555
<i>who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,895
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,902
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,323
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom</i>

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,286
<i>the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring</i>

21
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,538
<i>to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice,</i>

23
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,047
<i>and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,885
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>One by one</i>

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:23,351
<i>the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,521
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,439
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>But the power of the Ring</i>

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,807
<i>It was in this moment</i>

34
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,393
<i>when all hope had faded</i>

35
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,648
<i>that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,227
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,361
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur</i>

38
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,618
<i>But the hearts of Men</i>

40
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,246
<i>are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,126
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,945
<i>It betrayed Isildur</i>

43
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,200
<i>to his death.</i>

44
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,332
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten</i>

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,793
<i>were lost.</i>

46
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,921
<i>History became legend</i>

47
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,132
<i>legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,176
<i>And for two and a half thousand years</i>

49
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,014
<i>the Ring passed out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,476
<i>Until, when chance came</i>

51
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,271
<i>it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:01,444
My precious.

53
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>The Ring came to the creature Gollum</i>

54
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,326
<i>who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,873
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,502
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:23,341
My precious.

59
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,473
<i>The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,518
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,315
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

62
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,694
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,863
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East</i>

64
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,866
<i>whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,369
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived</i>

66
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,290
<i>its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,378
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,550
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,306
What's this?

71
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,894
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,854
A ring.

74
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,857
Lost!

75
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,154
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>For the time will soon come</i>

77
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,878
The 22nd day of September

79
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,213
in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,051
by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:54,140
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing

82
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,934
the Shire

83
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,896
Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,862
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,419
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,838
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,474
Now

89
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,185
where to begin?

90
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,521
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,694
"Concerning

92
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,530
Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,242
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire,</i>

94
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,411
<i>for many hundreds of years</i>

95
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,581
<i>quite content to ignore and be ignored</i>

96
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,923
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count</i>

98
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,260
<i>Hobbits must seem of little importance</i>

99
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,473
<i>being neither renowned as great warriors,</i>

100
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,811
<i>nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,193
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some</i>

103
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,660
<i>that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.</i>

104
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,245
<i>A rather unfair observation</i>

105
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales,</i>

106
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,211
<i>and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,547
<i>But where our hearts truly lie</i>

108
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,842
<i>is in peace and quiet,</i>

109
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,719
<i>and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:55,803 --> 00:10:01,058
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.</i>

111
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:14,030
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:20,495
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,877
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,314
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,551
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

118
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,402
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

119
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

120
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,286
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

121
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>-And I must follow if I can</i>
-You're late.

123
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,886
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,308
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,781
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,330
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,167
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,296
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,882
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,051
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,012
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,931
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,437
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on</i>

134
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,690
<i>very much as it has this past Age</i>

135
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,449
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,203
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire</i>

138
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,832
<i>passing from one generation to the next.</i>

139
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill</i>

140
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,345
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,390
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,019
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,120
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,694
<i>He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.</i>

146
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,042
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,904
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,623
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,499
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,834
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,968
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,089
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,973
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:09,139
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,935
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,106
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,442
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,033
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,373
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,046
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,940
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,612
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,826
So am I.

164
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,472
Whoa, whoa.

165
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,234
No, thank you!

166
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,405
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

167
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,034
And what about very old friends?

168
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,872
Gandalf?

169
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,084
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

170
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:06,382
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

171
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,136
You haven't aged a day.

172
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,769
Come on, come in!

173
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,355
Welcome, welcome.

174
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,067
Oh, here we are.

175
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,237
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

176
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,241
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

177
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,413
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

178
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,126
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

179
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,921
Just tea, thank you.

180
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,135
Oh!

181
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,096
I was expecting you sometime last week.

182
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,599
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

183
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,979
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,442
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

185
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,613
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart...

186
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,325
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

187
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,287
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,107
I could make you some eggs if you'd...

189
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,964
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

190
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,682
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

191
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,512
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

192
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,223
I'm not at home!

193
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,856
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

194
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,490
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

195
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,361
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

196
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,322
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day

197
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,325
never giving me a moment's peace.

198
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,704
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

199
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:05,375
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

200
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,546
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

201
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,966
All the arrangements are made.

202
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,511
Oh, thank you.

203
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,388
Frodo suspects something.

204
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,016
Of course he does. He's a Baggins

205
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,852
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

206
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,189
You will tell him, won't you?

207
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,150
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

208
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,862
I know.

209
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,535
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

210
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,664
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

211
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,584
The woods, the fields.

212
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,045
Little rivers.

213
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,219
I am old, Gandalf.

214
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,892
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

215
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,605
I feel thin.

216
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,399
Sort of stretched

217
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,111
like butter scraped over too much bread.

218
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,783
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

219
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,203
And I don't expect I shall return.

220
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,584
In fact, I mean not to.

221
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,382
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

222
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,732
Ah.

223
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,318
Gandalf, my old friend

224
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,280
this will be a night to remember.

225
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,137
Hello, hello.

226
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,475
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

227
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,104
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

228
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,276
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,113
Go on!

230
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,999
So there I was

231
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,378
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

232
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,547
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves

233
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,216
about how they were going to cook us.

234
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,347
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

235
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,018
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors

236
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,689
that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees,

237
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,192
and turned them all to stone!

238
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,866
Quickly.

239
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,911
Whoa!

240
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,038
Up they go!

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,209
No, the big one.

242
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,262
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

243
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,390
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,518
Good gracious, you have been productive.

245
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,855
Bilbo?

246
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,233
Sackville-Bagginses!

247
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,568
Quickly, hide!

248
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,580
Thank you, my boy.

249
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,501
You're a good lad, Frodo.

250
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,588
I'm very selfish, you know.

251
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,466
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,885
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died,

253
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,569
but it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,764
I think it was because

255
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,226
of all my numerous relations

256
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,021
you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,148
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,025
No.

259
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,986
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,406
The point is, Frodo...

261
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,453
you'll be all right.

262
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,000
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,668
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

264
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,295
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,646
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,691
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,375
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,337
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:48,134
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,137
I might've known.

271
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,103
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,396
Speech!

273
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,607
Speech!

274
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,156
My dear Bagginses and Boffins

275
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,200
Tooks and Brandybucks

276
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,911
Grubbs, Chubbs

277
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,079
Hornblowers

278
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,874
Bolgers

279
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,917
Bracegirdles,

280
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,670
- and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,009
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,428
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,891
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among

284
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,895
such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,606
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like,

286
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,362
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,492
I, uh...

288
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,707
I have things to do.

289
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,216
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,015
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,351
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,355
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,942
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,353
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,939
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:12,195
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,572
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,410
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

299
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,373
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

300
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,292
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,671
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,133
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

303
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,637
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,683
No. Wait, it's...

305
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,855
here in my pocket.

306
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,738
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

307
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,868
Yet, after all, why not?

308
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,333
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,001
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,462
Well, no.

311
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,382
And yes.

312
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,387
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

313
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,431
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

314
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,811
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

315
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,063
It's mine.

316
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,817
My own.

317
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,195
- My precious.
- Precious?

318
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,282
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

319
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,076
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,913
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

321
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,082
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,420
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,341
I am not trying to rob you.

324
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,098
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,901
All your long years, we've been friends.

326
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,445
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,116
Let it go.

328
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,661
You're right, Gandalf.

329
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,457
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,836
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,464
Yes, it is time.

332
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,303
- Bilbo.
- Hm?

333
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,306
The ring is still in your pocket.

334
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,602
Ah. Yes.

335
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,010
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:28,724
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,312
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

338
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,814
Goodbye, Gandalf.

339
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,195
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

340
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,207
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

341
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,128
Until our next meeting.

342
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,242
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

343
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,788
<i>My precious.</i>

344
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,082
Riddles in the dark.

345
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,667
Bilbo!

346
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,378
Bilbo!

347
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,926
My precious.

348
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,804
Precious.

349
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,516
He's gone, hasn't he?

350
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,313
He talked for so long about leaving

351
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,275
I didn't think he'd really do it.

352
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,614
Gandalf?

353
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,583
Bilbo's ring.

354
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,335
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

355
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,589
He's left you Bag End.

356
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,803
Along with all his possessions.

357
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,806
The ring is yours now.

358
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,979
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

359
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,439
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

360
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,819
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

361
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,323
I don't understand.

362
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,660
Neither do I.

363
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,332
Keep it secret.

364
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,210
Keep it safe.

365
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,372
<i>Shire!</i>

366
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,834
<i>Baggins!</i>

367
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,343
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.</i>

368
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,972
<i>Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor,</i>

369
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,768
<i>and the finding
of the Ring of Power."</i>

370
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,148
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

371
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,819
<i>The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.</i>

372
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,489
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate,</i>

373
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,493
<i>for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.</i>

374
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,121
<i>It is precious to me</i>

375
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,625
<i>though I buy it with great pain.</i>

376
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,965
<i>The markings upon the band begin to fade.</i>

377
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,970
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.</i>

378
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,266
<i>A secret now
that only fire can tell."</i>

379
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,827
Shire.

380
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,955
Baggins.

381
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,501
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

382
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,671
That way.

383
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,928
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

384
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,431
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

385
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,558
<i>But there still be</i>

386
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,226
<i>Many miles to go</i>

387
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,353
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

388
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,731
<i>And the stream that falls
From hill to plain</i>

389
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,733
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

390
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,278
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took</i>

391
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,534
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

392
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,830
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

393
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,707
War is brewing.

394
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,293
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

395
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,087
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

396
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:36,759
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

397
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,929
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

398
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,555
And proud of it.

399
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,974
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

400
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:48,270
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

401
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,734
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

402
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,322
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

403
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,993
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

404
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,579
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

405
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:10,251
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

406
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,420
Does she?

407
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,090
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

408
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,368
Is it secret? Is it safe?

409
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,583
Ah.

410
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,379
What are you doing?

411
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,518
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

412
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,812
It's quite cool.

413
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,150
What can you see?

414
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,321
Can you see anything?

415
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,492
Nothing.

416
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,120
There's nothing.

417
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,664
Wait.

418
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,003
There are markings.

419
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,008
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

420
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,678
There are few who can.

421
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,058
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

422
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,726
Mordor!

423
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,103
In the common tongue, it says:

424
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,732
"One Ring to rule them all

425
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,401
One Ring to find them

426
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,696
One Ring to bring them all,

427
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,032
and in the darkness bind them."

428
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,744
This is the One Ring

429
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:14,249
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

430
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,379
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

431
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,716
Bilbo found it.

432
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,093
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

433
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,931
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping

434
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,477
prolonging his life, delaying old age.

435
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:37,606
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

436
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,109
The Ring has awoken.

437
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,153
It's heard its master's call.

438
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:47,200
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

439
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,999
No, Frodo.

440
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,294
The spirit of Sauron endured.

441
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:04,759
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

442
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,261
Sauron has returned.

443
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,305
His Orcs have multiplied.

444
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,518
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

445
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:19,523
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

446
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,817
He is seeking it.

447
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,780
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

448
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,824
For the Ring yearns above all else

449
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,328
to return to the hand of its master.

450
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,413
They are one

451
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,666
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

452
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,834
Frodo

453
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,336
he must never find it.

454
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,547
All right.

455
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,217
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

456
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,054
No one knows it's here, do they?

457
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,936
Do they, Gandalf?

458
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,357
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

459
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,694
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

460
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,072
But the enemy found him first.

461
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,242
<i>I don't know how long they tortured him.</i>

462
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,955
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

463
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,249
Shire!

464
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,084
Baggins!

465
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,086
Shire.

466
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,173
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

467
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,011
Who goes there?

468
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,972
Take it, Gandalf!

469
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,473
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

470
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,059
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

471
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,521
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

472
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,233
I dare not take it.

473
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,028
Not even to keep it safe.

474
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,197
Understand, Frodo

475
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,493
I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

476
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:05,630
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

477
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,133
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

478
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,637
No, it can't.

479
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,352
What must I do?

480
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,606
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

481
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,027
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

482
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,444
Bree.

483
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,447
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you

484
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,117
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

485
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:39,037
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

486
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,165
I don't have any answers.

487
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:48,297
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

488
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,549
He'll know what to do.

489
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,969
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

490
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,764
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

491
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,685
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

492
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,480
I can cut across country easily enough.

493
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,317
My dear Frodo.

494
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,695
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

495
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,823
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

496
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,367
And yet, after a hundred years

497
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,662
they can still surprise you.

498
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,498
Get down.

499
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,305
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

500
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,976
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

501
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,604
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

502
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,690
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

503
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,859
Nothing important.

504
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,613
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

505
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:59,493
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

506
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,829
No?

507
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,165
Perhaps not.

508
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,836
I've thought of a better use for you.

509
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,549
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

510
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,427
Be careful, both of you.

511
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,430
The enemy has many spies in his service:

512
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,517
Birds, beasts.

513
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,062
Is it safe?

514
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,232
Never put it on,

515
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,777
for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

516
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,404
Always remember, Frodo

517
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:39,074
the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

518
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,577
It wants to be found.

519
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,411
This is it.

520
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,914
This is what?

521
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,250
If I take one more step

522
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,629
it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

523
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,426
Come on, Sam.

524
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,645
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

525
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:54,024
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
<i>- "Going out your door.</i>

526
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:58,653
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet</i>

527
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,950
<i>there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."</i>

528
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,799
Sam.

529
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,429
Wood-elves.

530
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,654
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

531
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,990
To the Grey Havens.

532
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,659
They're leaving Middle-earth.

533
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,995
Never to return.

534
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't know why

535
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,086
it makes me sad.

536
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:02,801
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

537
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,262
Just shut your eyes,

538
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,223
and imagine you're back in your own bed

539
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,311
with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

540
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

541
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,368
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

542
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,039
Me neither, Sam.

543
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,653
<i>Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

544
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,530
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

545
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,284
<i>And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard</i>

546
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,953
<i>seeking my counsel.</i>

547
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:16,124
For that is why you have come, is it not?

548
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,543
My old friend.

549
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,420
Saruman.

550
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,261
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

551
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,347
So the Ring of Power has been found.

552
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,767
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

553
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,062
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

554
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:42,192
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

555
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,113
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

556
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,699
Time?

557
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,244
What time do you think we have?

558
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,623
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

559
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,959
He cannot yet take physical form,

560
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,920
but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

561
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:07,634
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

562
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:14,141
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

563
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,812
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

564
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,985
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

565
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,821
The Eye of Sauron.

566
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,615
He is gathering all evil to him.

567
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,284
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough,

568
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,621
for an assault upon Middle-earth.

569
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,332
You know this?

570
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,334
How?

571
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,628
I have seen it.

572
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,256
A palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

573
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,467
Why?

574
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,637
Why should we fear to use it?

575
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:58,226
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

576
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,605
We do not know who else may be watching.

577
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,985
The hour is later than you think.

578
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,446
Sauron's forces are already moving.

579
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,451
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

580
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,910
The Nine?

581
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,164
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve

582
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,042
disguised as riders in black.

583
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:26,130
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

584
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,967
And kill the one who carries it.

585
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,969
Frodo!

586
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:48,986
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

587
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,531
There are none who can.

588
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,786
Against the power of Mordor

589
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,581
there can be no victory.

590
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,711
We must join with him, Gandalf.

591
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,339
We must join with Sauron.

592
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,678
It would be wise, my friend.

593
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,638
Tell me

594
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,848
friend

595
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,395
when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

596
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,603
I gave you the chance

597
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,439
of aiding me willingly,

598
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:12,736
but you have elected the way of pain!

599
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,511
Mr. Frodo?

600
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,930
Frodo? Frodo!

601
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,642
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,771
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

603
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,484
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

604
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:56,363
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

605
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,367
Frodo.

606
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,911
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

607
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,454
Get off him.

608
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,497
Come on, Frodo.

609
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,500
What's the meaning of this?

610
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,859
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

611
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,340
You get back here!

612
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,717
Get out of my field!

613
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,762
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

614
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,890
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

615
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,183
And some cabbages.

616
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,269
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

617
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:32,565
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is

618
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,943
he's clearly overreacting.

619
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,570
Run!

620
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,586
Oh, that was close.

621
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,798
I think I've broken something.

622
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,218
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

623
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:04,055
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

624
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,433
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

625
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,693
That's mine.

626
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,073
That's nice, Merry.

627
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,700
Here's a nice one, Sam.

628
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,370
I think we should get off the road.

629
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,005
Get off the road!

630
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,632
Quick!

631
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,813
Be quiet!

632
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,298
What was that?

633
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,499
Anything?

634
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,667
Nothing.

635
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,670
What is going on?

636
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:45,008
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

637
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,844
Frodo?

638
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,596
Get down!

639
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,782
I have to leave the Shire.

640
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,160
Sam and I must get to Bree.

641
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,703
Right.

642
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,374
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

643
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,008
Run!

644
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,220
This way! Follow me!

645
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,808
Run!

646
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,823
Get the rope, Sam!

647
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,035
Frodo!

648
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,162
Run, Frodo!

649
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,663
- Go!
- Hurry!

650
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,417
Frodo, come on!

651
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,336
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

652
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,522
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

653
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,622
Come on.

654
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,219
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

655
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,600
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

656
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,688
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

657
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,233
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

658
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,861
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

659
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,573
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

660
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,576
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

661
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,870
Can't be too careful.

662
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,102
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

663
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,877
Excuse me.

664
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,756
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

665
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:18,054
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

666
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:22,809
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

667
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,020
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

668
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,857
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

669
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,153
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

670
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,321
Gandalf.

671
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,907
Oh, yes

672
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,160
I remember. Elderly chap.

673
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,413
Big Grey beard, pointy hat.

674
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,665
Not seen him for six months.

675
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,715
What do we do now?

676
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,223
Sam

677
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,225
he'll be here. He'll come.

678
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,063
Get out of my way!

679
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,109
What's that?

680
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,903
This, my friend, is a pint.

681
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,697
It comes in pints?

682
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,743
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

683
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,920
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

684
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,966
Excuse me.

685
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,763
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

686
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:47,352
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

687
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:52,106
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

688
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,735
Strider.

689
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,960
<i>Baggins.</i>

690
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,965
<i>Baggins.</i>

691
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:27,475
<i>Baggins. Baggins.</i>

692
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,604
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

693
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,316
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

694
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,527
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side,

695
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,947
and my third cousin, twice removed...

696
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,203
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

697
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,193
You cannot hide.

698
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,325
I see you.

699
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,745
There is no life

700
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,122
in the void.

701
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,750
Only

702
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,169
death.

703
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,055
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

704
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,852
What do you want?

705
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,312
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

706
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,399
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

707
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,277
I can avoid being seen if I wish,

708
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:05,114
but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

709
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,242
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

710
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,578
Yes.

711
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,624
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

712
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,172
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

713
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,011
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

714
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,097
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

715
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,224
They're coming.

716
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,434
What are they?

717
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,730
They were once Men.

718
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,524
Great kings of Men.

719
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,819
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

720
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,490
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

721
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,118
One by one, falling into darkness.

722
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,746
Now they are slaves to his will.

723
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,874
They are the Nazgûl.

724
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,753
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

725
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,005
At all times they feel

726
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,132
<i>the presence of the Ring</i>

727
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:32,804
<i>drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

728
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,691
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

729
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:58,037
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

730
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,998
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer,

731
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:05,294
- and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

732
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,756
We have no choice but to trust him.

733
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,343
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

734
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,015
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

735
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,352
We're going to see the Elves.

736
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,294
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

737
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,130
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

738
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,508
What about second breakfast?

739
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:59,139
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

740
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:04,603
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

741
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,900
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

742
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,948
Pippin!

743
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,968
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

744
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,842
Who is she?

745
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,137
This woman you sing of.

746
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,018
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

747
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:31,315
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

748
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,278
What happened to her?

749
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,991
She died.

750
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,372
Get some sleep, Frodo.

751
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:00,761
<i>The power of Isengard is at your command</i>

752
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:05,349
<i>Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

753
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:14,483
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

754
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:24,660
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

755
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,038
We have work to do.

756
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:14,251
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

757
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,462
Rip them all down.

758
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,784
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

759
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,163
We shall rest here tonight.

760
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:06,386
These are for you.
Keep them close.

761
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,014
I'm going to have a look around.

762
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,310
Stay here.

763
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,023
My tomato's burst.

764
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,233
Could I have some bacon?

765
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,319
Want a tomato, Sam?

766
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:26,406
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

767
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,368
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

768
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:33,497
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

769
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,674
Go!

770
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,562
Back, you devils!

771
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,314
Frodo!

772
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,194
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

773
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,232
Strider!

774
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:55,532
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

775
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,914
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

776
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,627
Hurry!

777
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:11,798
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

778
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:13,759
Hold on, Frodo.

779
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:16,595
Gandalf!

780
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,381
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

781
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,386
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

782
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,182
Is he going to die?

783
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:12,187
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

784
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,237
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

785
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,906
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

786
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,199
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

787
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:27,452
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

788
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,971
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

789
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,914
Frodo.

790
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,682
Who is she?

791
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,101
Frodo.

792
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:36,855
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

793
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,359
He's not going to last.

794
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,154
We must get him to my father.

795
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,824
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

796
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:54,039
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

797
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,215
What are they saying?

798
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,889
I do not fear them.

799
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,191
Arwen

800
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:25,529
ride hard. Don't look back.

801
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:34,955
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

802
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:32,280
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

803
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,784
If you want him, come and claim him.

804
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,174
No. No!

805
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,804
Frodo, no.

806
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,306
Frodo, don't give in.

807
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,434
Not now.

808
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,864
<i>What grace is given me</i>

809
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,366
<i>let it pass to him.</i>

810
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,744
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

811
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,413
<i>Save him.</i>

812
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,972
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

813
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:27,938
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

814
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,693
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

815
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,406
And you're lucky to be here too.

816
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,161
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

817
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:47,415
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

818
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:57,509
What happened, Gandalf?

819
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:03,848
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

820
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:10,355
I was delayed.

821
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:15,443
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

822
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:24,202
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

823
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,247
Embrace the power of the Ring,

824
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,333
or embrace your own destruction!

825
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:36,506
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

826
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:40,760
Only one who can bend it to his will.

827
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,515
And he does not share power.

828
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,241
So you have chosen death.

829
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:17,088
Gandalf? What is it?

830
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:19,841
Nothing, Frodo.

831
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,426
Frodo!

832
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,678
Frodo!

833
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:26,264
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

834
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,100
Sam has hardly left your side.

835
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,811
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

836
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:37,025
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

837
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:42,113
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

838
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:33,539
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

839
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,375
Bilbo.

840
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,132
<i>"There and Back Again:</i>

841
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:45,135
<i>A Hobbit's Tale, by</i> Bilbo Baggins."

842
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:51,766
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back

843
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,895
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood

844
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,648
visit Lake-town

845
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:02,277
see the Lonely Mountain again.

846
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:07,615
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

847
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,504
I miss the Shire.

848
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:27,051
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

849
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,972
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

850
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:37,520
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

851
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,945
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

852
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,407
My dear boy.

853
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:57,457
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

854
01:28:58,249 --> 01:29:00,126
No harm in being prepared.

855
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,878
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

856
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:05,965
- More than anything.
- I did.

857
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,009
It's just...

858
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,470
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

859
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:15,349
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought

860
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,853
seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

861
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,688
Off home.

862
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,861
You are right, Sam.

863
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,783
We did what we set out to do.

864
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,953
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

865
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,376
I am ready to go home.

866
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,253
His strength returns.

867
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:50,093
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

868
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,262
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring

869
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:57,183
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

870
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,645
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

871
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:06,400
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

872
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:11,155
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

873
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,200
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

874
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,579
Our list of allies grows thin.

875
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:21,207
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

876
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:25,044
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

877
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,630
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

878
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:32,551
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

879
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:35,096
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

880
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:39,683
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

881
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:44,188
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

882
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,110
Gandalf

883
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,031
the Ring cannot stay here.

884
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,720
<i>This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.</i>

885
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,681
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

886
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,311
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

887
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,606
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

888
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:32,862
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

889
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,325
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

890
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,369
Men?

891
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:43,539
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

892
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:48,127
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

893
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:52,006
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

894
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,758
I was there, Gandalf.

895
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:57,261
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

896
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,562
<i>when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

897
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,608
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

898
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:15,697
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

899
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:20,910
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom</i>

900
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,747
<i>where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

901
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,458
Cast it into the fire!

902
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,426
- Destroy it!
- No.

903
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,929
Isildur!

904
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:45,143
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

905
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,484
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

906
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:58,113
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

907
01:32:58,197 --> 01:33:03,160
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

908
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,664
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

909
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,211
He turned from that path a long time ago.

910
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,464
He has chosen exile.

911
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,746
You are no Elf.

912
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,957
Men of the South are welcome here.

913
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,045
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

914
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,382
Then we are here on common purpose

915
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,218
friend.

916
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:18,319
The shards of Narsil.

917
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:26,244
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

918
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:31,415
It's still sharp.

919
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:43,386
But no more than a broken heirloom.

920
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,249
Why do you fear the past?

921
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:19,463
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

922
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,134
You are not bound to his fate.

923
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:27,638
The same blood flows in my veins.

924
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:33,227
The same weakness.

925
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,816
Your time will come.

926
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:43,321
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

927
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,540
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

928
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:43,547
forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

929
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,592
And to that I hold.

930
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:50,346
I would rather share
one lifetime with you

931
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:54,475
than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

932
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,696
I choose a mortal life.

933
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:12,284
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

934
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:18,040
like my heart.

935
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:37,601
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old

936
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,647
you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

937
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,153
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

938
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,989
You will unite, or you will fall.

939
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:55,411
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

940
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,750
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

941
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:16,557
So it is true.

942
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,118
In a dream

943
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,831
I saw the eastern sky grow dark,

944
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,123
but in the West a pale light lingered.

945
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:45,377
A voice was crying:

946
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:48,589
"Your doom is near at hand.

947
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,343
Isildur's Bane is found."

948
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,182
Isildur's Bane.

949
01:38:58,849 --> 01:39:00,226
Boromir!

950
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:27,210
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

951
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:31,089
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond,

952
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:33,342
for the Black Speech of Mordor

953
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,052
may yet be heard

954
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:38,221
in every corner of the West!

955
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:41,016
The Ring is altogether evil.

956
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,852
It is a gift.

957
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:45,521
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

958
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,315
Why not use this Ring?

959
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,276
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor

960
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,739
kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people

961
01:39:56,031 --> 01:39:58,242
are your lands kept safe.

962
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:04,373
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

963
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:08,419
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

964
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:13,131
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

965
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:16,802
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

966
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,096
This is no mere Ranger.

967
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,767
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

968
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:27,188
You owe him your allegiance.

969
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,194
Aragorn.

970
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,781
This is Isildur's heir?

971
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,828
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

972
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:52,630
Gondor has no king.

973
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,133
Gondor needs no king.

974
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:06,477
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

975
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,981
You have only one choice.

976
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,609
The Ring must be destroyed.

977
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:21,367
What are we waiting for?

978
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,507
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin

979
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:41,011
by any craft that we here possess.

980
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:45,724
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

981
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:49,687
Only there can it be unmade.

982
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,398
It must be taken deep into Mordor,

983
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:57,361
and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

984
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,533
One of you

985
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:05,202
must do this.

986
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:11,834
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

987
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,380
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

988
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:21,426
There is evil there that does not sleep.

989
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,764
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

990
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,642
It is a barren wasteland

991
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:32,437
riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

992
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:36,400
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

993
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,904
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

994
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:45,659
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

995
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:48,453
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

996
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:53,291
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

997
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:58,797
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

998
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:03,260
Never trust an Elf!

999
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:10,267
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1000
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,437
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1001
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:34,458
I will take it.

1002
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,962
I will take it.

1003
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,846
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1004
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,147
Though...

1005
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,069
I do not know the way.

1006
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,450
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins

1007
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:11,954
as long as it is yours to bear.

1008
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,166
If by my life or death I can protect you

1009
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,252
I will.

1010
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:23,757
You have my sword.

1011
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,678
And you have my bow.

1012
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,764
And my ax.

1013
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:40,774
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1014
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:46,447
If this is indeed the will of the Council

1015
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:49,324
- then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1016
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:56,790
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you

1017
01:44:56,874 --> 01:45:01,795
even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1018
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,256
We're coming too!

1019
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,183
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1020
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,723
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of

1021
01:45:13,056 --> 01:45:14,432
mission.

1022
01:45:14,516 --> 01:45:16,059
Quest.

1023
01:45:16,518 --> 01:45:17,561
Thing.

1024
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:22,065
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1025
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,569
Nine companions.

1026
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,239
So be it.

1027
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,576
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

1028
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,161
Great!

1029
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:37,581
Where are we going?

1030
01:46:23,653 --> 01:46:27,157
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1031
01:46:27,657 --> 01:46:29,357
That you'd never escape your fate.

1032
01:46:29,826 --> 01:46:33,496
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings,

1033
01:46:33,913 --> 01:46:37,834
but only you have the power to wield it.

1034
01:46:38,835 --> 01:46:41,338
I do not want that power.

1035
01:46:41,504 --> 01:46:44,174
I have never wanted it.

1036
01:46:45,508 --> 01:46:48,158
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1037
01:46:52,515 --> 01:46:54,851
My old sword! Sting.

1038
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:56,210
Here, take it. Take it.

1039
01:47:01,691 --> 01:47:05,654
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1040
01:47:06,363 --> 01:47:10,450
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.

1041
01:47:10,659 --> 01:47:15,205
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1042
01:47:15,413 --> 01:47:17,874
Here's a pretty thing.

1043
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,584
Mithril.

1044
01:47:20,377 --> 01:47:24,756
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1045
01:47:24,964 --> 01:47:28,218
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1046
01:47:31,763 --> 01:47:33,223
Oh!

1047
01:47:36,267 --> 01:47:38,311
My old ring.

1048
01:47:39,562 --> 01:47:43,483
I should very much like

1049
01:47:43,733 --> 01:47:47,737
to hold it again, one last time.

1050
01:48:05,088 --> 01:48:08,758
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1051
01:48:09,092 --> 01:48:13,221
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1052
01:48:17,726 --> 01:48:20,770
I'm sorry for everything.

1053
01:48:35,785 --> 01:48:39,998
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1054
01:48:41,332 --> 01:48:43,960
On you who travel with him, no oath,

1055
01:48:44,169 --> 01:48:47,297
nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1056
01:48:50,759 --> 01:48:53,303
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1057
01:48:53,762 --> 01:48:57,682
May the blessings of Elves and Men,

1058
01:48:58,224 --> 01:49:00,810
and all Free Folk go with you.

1059
01:49:03,897 --> 01:49:07,984
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1060
01:49:26,419 --> 01:49:28,922
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1061
01:49:29,464 --> 01:49:31,299
Left.

1062
01:50:50,795 --> 01:50:55,216
<i>We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1063
01:50:55,425 --> 01:50:59,178
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

1064
01:50:59,387 --> 01:51:02,932
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

1065
01:51:03,099 --> 01:51:06,936
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1066
01:51:08,771 --> 01:51:09,814
Move your feet.

1067
01:51:10,023 --> 01:51:11,482
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1068
01:51:11,566 --> 01:51:12,942
Faster!

1069
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:18,114
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not

1070
01:51:18,323 --> 01:51:21,075
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1071
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:24,621
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1072
01:51:25,288 --> 01:51:29,125
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1073
01:51:29,459 --> 01:51:34,839
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1074
01:51:44,057 --> 01:51:45,141
Sorry!

1075
01:51:45,975 --> 01:51:47,477
Get him!

1076
01:51:48,811 --> 01:51:51,272
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1077
01:51:51,814 --> 01:51:54,150
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1078
01:51:57,946 --> 01:51:59,746
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1079
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:02,659
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1080
01:52:02,909 --> 01:52:05,620
It's moving fast.

1081
01:52:05,828 --> 01:52:07,997
Against the wind.

1082
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,917
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1083
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:13,836
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1084
01:52:47,245 --> 01:52:48,997
Spies of Saruman.

1085
01:52:49,747 --> 01:52:53,042
The passage south is being watched.

1086
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:57,547
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1087
01:53:10,184 --> 01:53:11,894
Frodo!

1088
01:53:30,872 --> 01:53:33,124
Boromir.

1089
01:53:33,374 --> 01:53:37,587
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt

1090
01:53:37,795 --> 01:53:40,923
over so small a thing.

1091
01:53:44,135 --> 01:53:46,095
Such a little thing.

1092
01:53:46,304 --> 01:53:47,764
Boromir!

1093
01:53:48,389 --> 01:53:51,100
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1094
01:54:00,902 --> 01:54:02,945
As you wish.

1095
01:54:03,654 --> 01:54:05,656
I care not.

1096
01:54:41,067 --> 01:54:45,780
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1097
01:54:45,988 --> 01:54:50,576
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1098
01:54:51,869 --> 01:54:54,831
<i>If the mountain defeats you</i>

1099
01:54:55,081 --> 01:54:59,502
<i>will you risk a more dangerous road?</i>

1100
01:55:11,848 --> 01:55:14,725
There is a fell voice on the air.

1101
01:55:15,852 --> 01:55:17,353
It's Saruman!

1102
01:55:26,237 --> 01:55:30,908
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1103
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,994
No!

1104
01:56:39,435 --> 01:56:41,270
We must get off the mountain!

1105
01:56:41,771 --> 01:56:46,108
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1106
01:56:46,275 --> 01:56:49,612
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1107
01:56:49,779 --> 01:56:53,532
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1108
01:56:53,783 --> 01:56:56,619
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1109
01:56:58,454 --> 01:57:02,291
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1110
01:57:02,959 --> 01:57:07,964
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1111
01:57:08,798 --> 01:57:13,678
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

1112
01:57:14,971 --> 01:57:18,474
Shadow and flame.

1113
01:57:21,811 --> 01:57:24,480
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1114
01:57:29,193 --> 01:57:31,320
We cannot stay here!

1115
01:57:31,487 --> 01:57:34,323
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1116
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:36,200
Frodo?

1117
01:57:39,203 --> 01:57:42,081
We will go through the mines.

1118
01:57:42,832 --> 01:57:44,709
So be it.

1119
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:55,303
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1120
01:57:58,848 --> 01:58:01,017
How is your shoulder?

1121
01:58:01,225 --> 01:58:04,520
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1122
01:58:06,022 --> 01:58:08,524
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1123
01:58:09,025 --> 01:58:11,944
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1124
01:58:12,361 --> 01:58:16,282
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1125
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:19,035
And, I fear, from within.

1126
01:58:21,704 --> 01:58:25,875
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1127
01:58:26,042 --> 01:58:28,878
Trust your own strengths.

1128
01:58:29,045 --> 01:58:31,755
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world,

1129
01:58:31,839 --> 01:58:33,883
for good or for evil.

1130
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:36,385
Some are greater than I am.

1131
01:58:36,886 --> 01:58:40,556
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1132
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:43,267
The walls

1133
01:58:43,976 --> 01:58:46,062
of Moria.

1134
01:58:51,776 --> 01:58:54,779
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1135
01:58:54,987 --> 01:58:59,408
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1136
01:58:59,784 --> 01:59:02,286
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1137
01:59:10,294 --> 01:59:13,589
Well, let's see.

1138
01:59:13,798 --> 01:59:15,174
Ithildin.

1139
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,178
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1140
01:59:33,234 --> 01:59:37,321
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1141
01:59:37,905 --> 01:59:42,535
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1142
01:59:42,785 --> 01:59:47,540
It's simple. If you are a friend, you
speak the password and the doors will open.

1143
02:00:11,313 --> 02:00:12,440
Nothing's happening.

1144
02:00:19,447 --> 02:00:23,659
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves

1145
02:00:23,993 --> 02:00:26,829
Men and Orcs.

1146
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:28,413
What are you going to do, then?

1147
02:00:28,497 --> 02:00:30,916
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1148
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,002
And if that does not shatter them,

1149
02:00:33,169 --> 02:00:35,962
and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions

1150
02:00:36,046 --> 02:00:39,508
I will try to find the opening words.

1151
02:00:52,354 --> 02:00:54,899
Mines are no place for a pony.

1152
02:00:55,107 --> 02:00:59,195
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1153
02:01:00,362 --> 02:01:03,199
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1154
02:01:03,699 --> 02:01:07,244
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1155
02:01:14,043 --> 02:01:16,629
Do not disturb the water.

1156
02:01:16,879 --> 02:01:18,714
Oh, it's useless.

1157
02:01:31,393 --> 02:01:33,562
It's a riddle.

1158
02:01:36,315 --> 02:01:39,443
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1159
02:01:39,818 --> 02:01:42,738
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1160
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,533
<i>Mellon.</i>

1161
02:02:03,592 --> 02:02:08,430
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1162
02:02:08,931 --> 02:02:14,603
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1163
02:02:16,105 --> 02:02:19,191
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1164
02:02:19,567 --> 02:02:21,944
And they call it a mine.

1165
02:02:22,152 --> 02:02:24,113
A mine!

1166
02:02:25,155 --> 02:02:28,492
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1167
02:02:32,788 --> 02:02:34,206
No.

1168
02:02:34,623 --> 02:02:36,208
No...

1169
02:02:37,459 --> 02:02:39,128
No!

1170
02:02:41,797 --> 02:02:43,299
Goblins.

1171
02:02:47,219 --> 02:02:51,515
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1172
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:55,144
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1173
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,316
- Frodo!
- Help!

1174
02:03:00,524 --> 02:03:02,151
Strider!

1175
02:03:02,318 --> 02:03:05,154
- Help!
- Get off him!

1176
02:03:05,321 --> 02:03:06,322
Aragorn!

1177
02:03:16,749 --> 02:03:17,833
Frodo!

1178
02:03:19,001 --> 02:03:20,544
Strider!

1179
02:03:44,151 --> 02:03:45,194
Into the mines!

1180
02:03:45,361 --> 02:03:48,572
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1181
02:03:52,868 --> 02:03:54,662
Run!

1182
02:04:11,553 --> 02:04:15,099
We now have but one choice.

1183
02:04:15,307 --> 02:04:20,229
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1184
02:04:20,437 --> 02:04:22,398
Be on your guard.

1185
02:04:22,606 --> 02:04:26,068
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs

1186
02:04:26,235 --> 02:04:29,780
in the deep places of the world.

1187
02:04:37,746 --> 02:04:41,709
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1188
02:04:41,917 --> 02:04:45,754
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1189
02:05:31,508 --> 02:05:35,220
The wealth of Moria is not in gold,

1190
02:05:35,387 --> 02:05:37,806
or jewels,

1191
02:05:37,973 --> 02:05:41,018
but mithril.

1192
02:05:59,369 --> 02:06:04,291
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1193
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,504
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1194
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:10,547
I never told him,

1195
02:06:10,714 --> 02:06:15,677
but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1196
02:06:28,023 --> 02:06:29,733
Pippin.

1197
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:53,048
I have no memory of this place.

1198
02:06:55,133 --> 02:06:56,635
- Are we lost?
- No.

1199
02:06:56,844 --> 02:06:59,346
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1200
02:06:59,555 --> 02:07:00,973
- Merry?
- What?

1201
02:07:01,265 --> 02:07:03,225
I'm hungry.

1202
02:07:14,528 --> 02:07:18,991
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1203
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:23,328
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1204
02:07:23,537 --> 02:07:27,708
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped,

1205
02:07:28,375 --> 02:07:30,043
or was set loose.

1206
02:07:30,544 --> 02:07:34,214
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1207
02:07:36,842 --> 02:07:39,595
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1208
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:45,517
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1209
02:07:45,684 --> 02:07:50,564
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1210
02:07:50,731 --> 02:07:56,695
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1211
02:07:57,613 --> 02:08:00,407
Before it drove him mad.

1212
02:08:00,699 --> 02:08:03,577
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1213
02:08:03,744 --> 02:08:04,953
Pity?

1214
02:08:06,038 --> 02:08:08,916
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1215
02:08:09,833 --> 02:08:15,047
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1216
02:08:16,465 --> 02:08:18,967
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1217
02:08:21,386 --> 02:08:25,349
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1218
02:08:25,557 --> 02:08:28,477
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1219
02:08:29,061 --> 02:08:34,983
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill

1220
02:08:35,776 --> 02:08:38,612
before this is over.

1221
02:08:40,113 --> 02:08:43,992
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1222
02:08:50,624 --> 02:08:54,002
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1223
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:57,464
I wish none of this had happened.

1224
02:08:57,631 --> 02:09:02,678
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1225
02:09:03,512 --> 02:09:09,017
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1226
02:09:10,519 --> 02:09:14,523
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1227
02:09:14,898 --> 02:09:17,317
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1228
02:09:17,818 --> 02:09:22,155
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1229
02:09:22,322 --> 02:09:25,534
And that is an encouraging thought.

1230
02:09:28,453 --> 02:09:29,621
Ah!

1231
02:09:30,414 --> 02:09:32,332
It's that way.

1232
02:09:32,541 --> 02:09:34,835
- He's remembered.
- No.

1233
02:09:35,043 --> 02:09:38,839
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1234
02:09:39,047 --> 02:09:44,219
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1235
02:09:59,067 --> 02:10:03,196
Let me risk a little more light.

1236
02:10:07,868 --> 02:10:09,953
Behold

1237
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:15,584
the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1238
02:10:18,086 --> 02:10:21,506
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1239
02:10:46,406 --> 02:10:48,116
Gimli!

1240
02:10:53,914 --> 02:10:55,373
No.

1241
02:10:55,582 --> 02:10:57,209
No!

1242
02:10:59,753 --> 02:11:02,923
Oh, no.

1243
02:11:04,758 --> 02:11:06,051
No.

1244
02:11:13,308 --> 02:11:15,310
"Here lies Balin

1245
02:11:15,769 --> 02:11:17,771
son of Fundin

1246
02:11:18,105 --> 02:11:20,732
Lord of Moria."

1247
02:11:21,775 --> 02:11:23,443
He is dead, then.

1248
02:11:25,612 --> 02:11:26,822
It's as I feared.

1249
02:11:45,132 --> 02:11:48,051
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1250
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:52,973
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1251
02:11:54,057 --> 02:11:56,643
We have barred the gates,

1252
02:11:57,310 --> 02:11:59,813
but cannot hold them for long.

1253
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,816
The ground shakes.

1254
02:12:03,191 --> 02:12:04,818
Drums

1255
02:12:05,193 --> 02:12:08,572
drums in the deep.

1256
02:12:12,117 --> 02:12:14,161
We cannot get out.

1257
02:12:16,163 --> 02:12:20,000
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1258
02:12:21,668 --> 02:12:24,212
We cannot get out.

1259
02:12:27,215 --> 02:12:29,176
They are coming."

1260
02:13:12,219 --> 02:13:14,054
Fool of a Took!

1261
02:13:14,387 --> 02:13:18,225
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1262
02:13:44,167 --> 02:13:45,794
Frodo!

1263
02:13:48,088 --> 02:13:49,589
Orcs.

1264
02:13:56,638 --> 02:13:58,640
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1265
02:14:05,897 --> 02:14:07,691
They have a cave-troll.

1266
02:14:23,498 --> 02:14:24,666
Let them come!

1267
02:14:25,166 --> 02:14:28,712
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1268
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:50,353
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1269
02:16:55,108 --> 02:16:56,776
Frodo!

1270
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:32,145
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1271
02:17:33,146 --> 02:17:35,023
Frodo!

1272
02:18:20,193 --> 02:18:22,070
Frodo!

1273
02:18:24,864 --> 02:18:26,324
Frodo!

1274
02:19:22,297 --> 02:19:23,631
Oh, no.

1275
02:19:32,015 --> 02:19:33,891
He's alive.

1276
02:19:36,311 --> 02:19:39,314
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1277
02:19:39,647 --> 02:19:41,816
You should be dead.

1278
02:19:42,025 --> 02:19:44,527
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1279
02:19:44,777 --> 02:19:49,532
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1280
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:56,456
Mithril.

1281
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:01,836
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1282
02:20:07,842 --> 02:20:09,802
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1283
02:20:24,776 --> 02:20:26,361
This way!

1284
02:21:36,764 --> 02:21:39,767
What is this new devilry?

1285
02:21:55,867 --> 02:21:58,661
A Balrog.

1286
02:21:58,953 --> 02:22:02,123
A demon of the ancient world.

1287
02:22:04,292 --> 02:22:06,753
This foe is beyond any of you.

1288
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,464
Run!

1289
02:22:16,804 --> 02:22:18,306
Quickly!

1290
02:22:34,947 --> 02:22:36,199
Gandalf.

1291
02:22:36,824 --> 02:22:38,451
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1292
02:22:39,827 --> 02:22:42,330
The bridge is near.

1293
02:22:44,415 --> 02:22:48,503
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1294
02:23:17,657 --> 02:23:19,367
Gandalf!

1295
02:23:37,677 --> 02:23:38,886
Merry! Pippin!

1296
02:23:50,022 --> 02:23:51,566
Sam!

1297
02:23:54,277 --> 02:23:57,530
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1298
02:24:00,575 --> 02:24:01,993
Not the beard!

1299
02:24:15,214 --> 02:24:17,091
Steady.

1300
02:24:19,218 --> 02:24:20,887
Hold on!

1301
02:24:41,949 --> 02:24:43,117
Hang on!

1302
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,630
Lean forward!

1303
02:24:58,633 --> 02:24:59,634
Steady.

1304
02:25:00,968 --> 02:25:02,136
Come on!

1305
02:25:02,386 --> 02:25:03,888
Now!

1306
02:25:21,113 --> 02:25:22,907
Over the bridge!

1307
02:25:23,157 --> 02:25:24,659
Fly!

1308
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:11,372
You cannot pass!

1309
02:26:11,539 --> 02:26:13,207
Gandalf!

1310
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:22,299
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1311
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:27,054
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1312
02:26:37,064 --> 02:26:39,066
Go back to the Shadow.

1313
02:26:46,907 --> 02:26:51,328
You shall not pass!

1314
02:27:18,481 --> 02:27:22,359
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1315
02:27:30,034 --> 02:27:32,495
Fly, you fools!

1316
02:27:36,624 --> 02:27:38,793
No!

1317
02:27:44,965 --> 02:27:47,134
Aragorn!

1318
02:28:44,358 --> 02:28:47,194
Legolas, get them up.

1319
02:28:51,323 --> 02:28:53,159
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1320
02:28:53,325 --> 02:28:56,954
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1321
02:28:57,163 --> 02:29:00,499
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1322
02:29:01,375 --> 02:29:04,712
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1323
02:29:06,213 --> 02:29:08,382
On your feet, Sam.

1324
02:29:08,716 --> 02:29:10,217
Frodo?

1325
02:29:12,303 --> 02:29:14,013
Frodo!

1326
02:30:06,523 --> 02:30:09,068
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1327
02:30:09,777 --> 02:30:13,948
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1328
02:30:14,156 --> 02:30:16,700
An Elf-witch

1329
02:30:17,243 --> 02:30:20,120
of terrible power.

1330
02:30:20,663 --> 02:30:22,873
All who look upon her

1331
02:30:23,082 --> 02:30:24,875
fall under her spell.

1332
02:30:25,084 --> 02:30:26,377
<i>Frodo!</i>

1333
02:30:28,629 --> 02:30:30,673
And are never seen again.

1334
02:30:30,881 --> 02:30:35,386
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1335
02:30:35,594 --> 02:30:39,306
<i>You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.</i>

1336
02:30:39,473 --> 02:30:41,267
Mr. Frodo?

1337
02:30:46,563 --> 02:30:52,152
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1338
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:56,907
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1339
02:31:04,581 --> 02:31:09,169
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1340
02:31:27,313 --> 02:31:29,663
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1341
02:31:29,773 --> 02:31:31,692
Speak words we can all understand!

1342
02:31:31,859 --> 02:31:36,447
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1343
02:31:36,697 --> 02:31:39,241
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1344
02:31:46,165 --> 02:31:48,125
That was not so courteous.

1345
02:31:54,673 --> 02:31:58,719
You bring great evil with you.

1346
02:32:00,471 --> 02:32:02,681
You can go no further.

1347
02:32:39,927 --> 02:32:42,596
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1348
02:32:43,722 --> 02:32:45,599
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1349
02:32:47,101 --> 02:32:50,437
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1350
02:32:51,313 --> 02:32:54,441
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1351
02:32:57,403 --> 02:32:59,446
You will follow me.

1352
02:33:11,125 --> 02:33:13,127
Caras Galadhon.

1353
02:33:13,752 --> 02:33:16,713
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1354
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:22,553
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1355
02:34:41,548 --> 02:34:44,676
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1356
02:34:45,344 --> 02:34:50,516
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1357
02:34:52,226 --> 02:34:56,688
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1358
02:34:56,939 --> 02:34:58,732
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1359
02:34:58,941 --> 02:35:02,069
For I much desire to speak with him.

1360
02:35:02,236 --> 02:35:05,030
I can no longer see him from afar.

1361
02:35:05,906 --> 02:35:11,078
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1362
02:35:11,328 --> 02:35:13,747
He has fallen into Shadow.

1363
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:22,965
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1364
02:35:24,591 --> 02:35:28,345
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1365
02:35:29,054 --> 02:35:32,432
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1366
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:37,771
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1367
02:35:38,438 --> 02:35:41,733
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1368
02:35:46,488 --> 02:35:50,784
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart

1369
02:35:51,076 --> 02:35:53,412
Gimli, son of Glóin.

1370
02:35:54,413 --> 02:35:57,958
For the world has grown full of peril,

1371
02:35:59,418 --> 02:36:02,087
and in all lands

1372
02:36:02,254 --> 02:36:05,757
love is now mingled with grief.

1373
02:36:18,395 --> 02:36:21,106
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1374
02:36:21,648 --> 02:36:24,651
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1375
02:36:27,613 --> 02:36:30,907
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1376
02:36:31,074 --> 02:36:34,161
Stray but a little and it will fail

1377
02:36:34,911 --> 02:36:37,748
to the ruin of all.

1378
02:36:42,085 --> 02:36:47,924
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1379
02:36:49,468 --> 02:36:54,181
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest,

1380
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:58,310
for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1381
02:37:00,562 --> 02:37:02,689
Tonight, you will sleep...

1382
02:37:02,856 --> 02:37:06,276
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire</i>

1383
02:37:07,861 --> 02:37:09,655
<i>one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1384
02:37:24,294 --> 02:37:26,880
A lament for Gandalf.

1385
02:37:34,137 --> 02:37:35,681
What do they say about him?

1386
02:37:35,889 --> 02:37:38,558
I have not the heart to tell you.

1387
02:37:41,311 --> 02:37:43,563
For me, the grief is still too near.

1388
02:37:46,525 --> 02:37:49,361
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1389
02:37:49,528 --> 02:37:52,572
There should be a verse about them.

1390
02:37:56,118 --> 02:37:58,120
<i>The finest rockets ever seen</i>

1391
02:37:59,246 --> 02:38:02,082
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green</i>

1392
02:38:02,999 --> 02:38:06,420
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers</i>

1393
02:38:08,922 --> 02:38:11,717
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers</i>

1394
02:38:11,883 --> 02:38:15,762
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1395
02:38:26,606 --> 02:38:29,276
Take some rest.

1396
02:38:29,443 --> 02:38:32,154
These borders are well-protected.

1397
02:38:32,362 --> 02:38:34,906
I will find no rest here.

1398
02:38:37,743 --> 02:38:40,746
I heard her voice inside my head.

1399
02:38:40,954 --> 02:38:44,708
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1400
02:38:44,916 --> 02:38:50,380
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1401
02:38:51,757 --> 02:38:54,593
But I cannot see it.

1402
02:38:55,927 --> 02:38:58,430
It is long since we had any hope.

1403
02:39:08,607 --> 02:39:10,734
My father is a noble man.

1404
02:39:11,485 --> 02:39:13,737
But his rule is failing,

1405
02:39:14,070 --> 02:39:19,493
and our people lose faith.

1406
02:39:20,911 --> 02:39:24,456
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1407
02:39:24,623 --> 02:39:28,168
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1408
02:39:31,004 --> 02:39:34,007
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1409
02:39:34,633 --> 02:39:36,676
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1410
02:39:36,843 --> 02:39:40,680
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1411
02:39:41,348 --> 02:39:44,851
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1412
02:39:47,729 --> 02:39:49,689
Have you ever been called home

1413
02:39:49,856 --> 02:39:53,819
by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1414
02:39:54,444 --> 02:39:57,697
I have seen the White City

1415
02:39:58,031 --> 02:39:59,533
long ago.

1416
02:40:00,492 --> 02:40:05,455
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1417
02:40:06,373 --> 02:40:09,334
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1418
02:40:09,793 --> 02:40:13,129
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1419
02:41:20,322 --> 02:41:22,866
Will you look into the mirror?

1420
02:41:23,033 --> 02:41:24,576
What will I see?

1421
02:41:27,537 --> 02:41:29,873
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1422
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:32,626
For the mirror

1423
02:41:32,834 --> 02:41:35,378
shows many things.

1424
02:41:38,381 --> 02:41:40,759
Things that were

1425
02:41:40,967 --> 02:41:43,553
things that are,

1426
02:41:44,304 --> 02:41:46,264
and some things...

1427
02:41:49,851 --> 02:41:53,146
that have not yet come to pass.

1428
02:43:15,729 --> 02:43:18,565
I know what it is you saw.

1429
02:43:20,984 --> 02:43:23,486
For it is also in my mind.

1430
02:43:25,238 --> 02:43:29,325
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1431
02:43:31,703 --> 02:43:36,583
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1432
02:43:37,208 --> 02:43:40,503
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1433
02:43:40,712 --> 02:43:42,714
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1434
02:43:43,715 --> 02:43:48,386
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1435
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:52,348
<i>If you ask it of me</i>

1436
02:43:52,724 --> 02:43:55,769
<i>I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1437
02:43:56,853 --> 02:43:59,022
You offer it to me freely.

1438
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:07,530
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1439
02:44:13,912 --> 02:44:17,207
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen

1440
02:44:17,624 --> 02:44:21,461
not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1441
02:44:22,087 --> 02:44:25,131
Treacherous as the sea!

1442
02:44:25,632 --> 02:44:30,553
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1443
02:44:31,012 --> 02:44:33,389
All shall love me,

1444
02:44:33,598 --> 02:44:36,434
and despair.

1445
02:44:50,532 --> 02:44:54,828
I pass the test. I will diminish,

1446
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:57,580
and go into the West,

1447
02:44:57,789 --> 02:45:02,252
- and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1448
02:45:05,839 --> 02:45:10,009
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power

1449
02:45:10,927 --> 02:45:12,428
is to be alone.

1450
02:45:15,765 --> 02:45:18,518
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.

1451
02:45:18,685 --> 02:45:20,311
And I am its keeper.

1452
02:45:23,523 --> 02:45:27,152
This task was appointed to you.

1453
02:45:28,194 --> 02:45:31,072
And if you do not find a way

1454
02:45:32,282 --> 02:45:34,284
no one will.

1455
02:45:34,659 --> 02:45:37,829
Then I know what I must do.

1456
02:45:38,496 --> 02:45:39,706
It's just...

1457
02:45:42,959 --> 02:45:45,211
I'm afraid to do it.

1458
02:45:48,715 --> 02:45:53,845
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1459
02:45:59,184 --> 02:46:04,898
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1460
02:46:05,690 --> 02:46:09,027
They were Elves once.

1461
02:46:10,195 --> 02:46:13,531
Taken by the Dark Powers

1462
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:16,910
tortured and mutilated.

1463
02:46:17,243 --> 02:46:22,540
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1464
02:46:22,832 --> 02:46:24,667
And now

1465
02:46:26,127 --> 02:46:28,004
perfected.

1466
02:46:28,713 --> 02:46:31,883
My fighting Uruk-hai

1467
02:46:33,843 --> 02:46:36,179
whom do you serve?

1468
02:46:36,387 --> 02:46:38,890
Saruman!

1469
02:46:59,744 --> 02:47:03,206
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1470
02:47:03,414 --> 02:47:06,292
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1471
02:47:06,542 --> 02:47:09,462
You will taste Man-flesh!

1472
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:18,263
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1473
02:47:18,429 --> 02:47:22,600
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1474
02:47:24,435 --> 02:47:25,728
Kill the others.

1475
02:47:44,914 --> 02:47:50,336
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1476
02:47:51,462 --> 02:47:55,300
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1477
02:48:02,473 --> 02:48:04,017
Lembas.

1478
02:48:04,267 --> 02:48:05,852
Elvish waybread.

1479
02:48:08,354 --> 02:48:11,357
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1480
02:48:17,864 --> 02:48:19,824
How many did you eat?

1481
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:21,659
Four.

1482
02:48:27,457 --> 02:48:30,167
<i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.</i>

1483
02:48:30,251 --> 02:48:34,380
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.</i>

1484
02:48:34,547 --> 02:48:37,050
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.</i>

1485
02:48:37,258 --> 02:48:41,054
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1486
02:48:41,262 --> 02:48:46,351
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1487
02:48:58,946 --> 02:49:00,364
By river you have the chance

1488
02:49:00,448 --> 02:49:03,659
of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1489
02:49:20,927 --> 02:49:25,765
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1490
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:29,519
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1491
02:49:34,899 --> 02:49:37,360
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1492
02:49:37,527 --> 02:49:41,531
They have already seen service in war.

1493
02:49:41,697 --> 02:49:43,950
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1494
02:49:44,117 --> 02:49:47,453
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1495
02:49:49,330 --> 02:49:51,290
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee</i>

1496
02:49:51,457 --> 02:49:54,043
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1497
02:49:54,210 --> 02:49:56,337
Thank you, my lady.

1498
02:49:58,131 --> 02:50:01,467
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1499
02:50:07,932 --> 02:50:10,977
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1500
02:50:11,144 --> 02:50:13,271
Nothing.

1501
02:50:13,896 --> 02:50:17,233
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time,

1502
02:50:17,859 --> 02:50:23,072
for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1503
02:50:30,121 --> 02:50:31,664
Actually...

1504
02:50:31,873 --> 02:50:33,499
There was one thing.

1505
02:50:34,333 --> 02:50:37,003
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1506
02:50:37,170 --> 02:50:39,964
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1507
02:50:42,508 --> 02:50:44,635
<i>I have nothing greater to give</i>

1508
02:50:44,802 --> 02:50:48,389
than the gift you already bear.

1509
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:17,126
That choice is yet before her.

1510
02:51:17,710 --> 02:51:20,630
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1511
02:51:20,963 --> 02:51:26,802
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil,

1512
02:51:26,969 --> 02:51:31,307
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1513
02:51:58,876 --> 02:52:02,088
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1514
02:52:02,255 --> 02:52:05,675
I give you the light of Eärendil

1515
02:52:06,425 --> 02:52:08,761
our most beloved star.

1516
02:52:17,895 --> 02:52:22,275
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places</i>

1517
02:52:22,525 --> 02:52:26,612
<i>when all other lights go out.</i>

1518
02:52:35,454 --> 02:52:38,624
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting

1519
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:43,546
having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1520
02:52:44,297 --> 02:52:47,633
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1521
02:52:47,883 --> 02:52:49,802
What was her gift?

1522
02:52:50,011 --> 02:52:54,932
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1523
02:52:55,725 --> 02:52:58,603
She gave me three.

1524
02:54:40,746 --> 02:54:44,208
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1525
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:51,048
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1526
02:54:51,257 --> 02:54:54,427
But he's too clever a waterman.

1527
02:54:55,261 --> 02:54:58,597
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts

1528
02:54:58,764 --> 02:55:01,099
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1529
02:55:01,183 --> 02:55:03,269
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1530
02:55:03,436 --> 02:55:06,522
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1531
02:55:06,689 --> 02:55:09,775
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1532
02:55:10,735 --> 02:55:13,738
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1533
02:55:13,904 --> 02:55:15,072
But you're not.

1534
02:55:15,364 --> 02:55:17,867
I'm here to help you.

1535
02:55:18,033 --> 02:55:19,744
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1536
02:55:25,708 --> 02:55:28,461
You can't help me, Sam.

1537
02:55:30,588 --> 02:55:32,298
Not this time.

1538
02:55:35,217 --> 02:55:37,303
Get some sleep.

1539
02:55:43,559 --> 02:55:45,770
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1540
02:55:46,312 --> 02:55:49,064
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1541
02:55:49,732 --> 02:55:52,032
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1542
02:55:52,318 --> 02:55:55,196
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1543
02:55:55,654 --> 02:55:57,704
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.

1544
02:55:59,492 --> 02:56:02,328
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1545
02:56:02,495 --> 02:56:05,498
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1546
02:56:05,706 --> 02:56:09,001
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1547
02:56:09,251 --> 02:56:11,462
But you will not see that.

1548
02:56:11,796 --> 02:56:13,214
You are afraid!

1549
02:56:13,464 --> 02:56:16,008
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1550
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:19,762
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1551
02:56:22,181 --> 02:56:26,519
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1552
02:56:38,364 --> 02:56:39,740
Frodo.

1553
02:56:41,617 --> 02:56:43,118
The Argonath.

1554
02:56:46,539 --> 02:56:50,292
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1555
02:56:51,043 --> 02:56:52,962
My kin.

1556
02:58:11,957 --> 02:58:14,126
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1557
02:58:14,376 --> 02:58:16,962
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1558
02:58:17,129 --> 02:58:20,633
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1559
02:58:21,050 --> 02:58:24,887
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil

1560
02:58:25,054 --> 02:58:28,307
an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1561
02:58:28,474 --> 02:58:31,602
And after that, it gets even better.

1562
02:58:31,977 --> 02:58:36,941
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1563
02:58:37,107 --> 02:58:38,484
That is our road.

1564
02:58:40,069 --> 02:58:43,405
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1565
02:58:43,489 --> 02:58:45,240
Recover my...

1566
02:58:48,243 --> 02:58:50,245
- We should leave now.
- No.

1567
02:58:50,412 --> 02:58:54,875
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1568
02:58:55,084 --> 02:58:58,504
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1569
02:58:58,754 --> 02:59:02,758
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1570
02:59:03,258 --> 02:59:07,429
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1571
02:59:09,431 --> 02:59:14,395
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1572
02:59:14,895 --> 02:59:16,605
Where's Frodo?

1573
02:59:42,214 --> 02:59:44,133
None of us should wander alone.

1574
02:59:45,551 --> 02:59:47,636
You, least of all.

1575
02:59:47,845 --> 02:59:50,305
So much depends on you.

1576
02:59:51,348 --> 02:59:53,308
Frodo?

1577
03:00:00,441 --> 03:00:02,985
I know why you seek solitude.

1578
03:00:03,694 --> 03:00:07,156
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1579
03:00:07,948 --> 03:00:10,993
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1580
03:00:12,578 --> 03:00:15,205
There are other ways, Frodo.

1581
03:00:15,456 --> 03:00:19,251
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1582
03:00:19,501 --> 03:00:23,255
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1583
03:00:23,505 --> 03:00:26,592
Warning? Against what?

1584
03:00:26,759 --> 03:00:28,886
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1585
03:00:29,094 --> 03:00:32,723
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have

1586
03:00:32,973 --> 03:00:36,727
- don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1587
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:41,857
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1588
03:00:43,400 --> 03:00:45,486
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1589
03:00:46,695 --> 03:00:50,365
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1590
03:00:52,201 --> 03:00:55,537
What chance do you think you have?

1591
03:00:55,704 --> 03:01:00,375
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1592
03:01:00,626 --> 03:01:04,296
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1593
03:01:06,423 --> 03:01:08,550
You fool!

1594
03:01:08,717 --> 03:01:12,721
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1595
03:01:12,888 --> 03:01:15,724
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1596
03:01:15,891 --> 03:01:17,226
- Give it to me!
- No!

1597
03:01:17,392 --> 03:01:19,228
- Give it to me!
- No.

1598
03:01:26,902 --> 03:01:28,904
I see your mind.

1599
03:01:29,154 --> 03:01:32,074
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1600
03:01:32,282 --> 03:01:34,159
You will betray us!

1601
03:01:34,409 --> 03:01:37,579
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1602
03:01:38,038 --> 03:01:41,667
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1603
03:01:48,757 --> 03:01:50,259
Frodo?

1604
03:01:54,596 --> 03:01:56,181
Frodo.

1605
03:02:00,102 --> 03:02:02,104
What have I done?

1606
03:02:02,312 --> 03:02:04,064
Please, Frodo.

1607
03:02:04,273 --> 03:02:06,942
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1608
03:02:07,151 --> 03:02:09,027
Frodo!

1609
03:02:55,490 --> 03:02:56,909
Frodo?

1610
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:01,246
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1611
03:03:01,496 --> 03:03:03,248
Stay away!

1612
03:03:03,665 --> 03:03:05,250
Frodo!

1613
03:03:07,502 --> 03:03:11,340
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1614
03:03:21,016 --> 03:03:23,518
Would you destroy it?

1615
03:03:28,523 --> 03:03:30,442
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1616
03:03:33,862 --> 03:03:36,198
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1617
03:03:38,033 --> 03:03:39,868
<i>Elessar.</i>

1618
03:03:47,542 --> 03:03:50,879
I would have gone with you to the end.

1619
03:03:51,546 --> 03:03:54,383
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1620
03:03:57,719 --> 03:03:58,887
I know.

1621
03:04:01,390 --> 03:04:06,812
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1622
03:04:10,565 --> 03:04:12,317
Go, Frodo!

1623
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:16,822
Run.

1624
03:04:17,072 --> 03:04:18,740
Run!

1625
03:04:43,265 --> 03:04:44,933
Mr. Frodo!

1626
03:04:54,234 --> 03:04:55,986
Find the halfling!

1627
03:04:57,612 --> 03:05:00,157
Find the halfling!

1628
03:05:03,618 --> 03:05:05,287
Elendil!

1629
03:05:11,793 --> 03:05:13,378
Aragorn, go!

1630
03:05:35,067 --> 03:05:36,401
Frodo!

1631
03:05:36,985 --> 03:05:38,570
Hide here. Quick!

1632
03:05:39,196 --> 03:05:40,655
Come on!

1633
03:05:43,158 --> 03:05:45,160
What's he doing?

1634
03:05:49,414 --> 03:05:51,416
He's leaving.

1635
03:05:56,171 --> 03:05:59,091
- No!
- Pippin!

1636
03:06:04,012 --> 03:06:06,348
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1637
03:06:06,932 --> 03:06:10,018
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1638
03:06:10,435 --> 03:06:12,020
- Over here!
- This way!

1639
03:06:22,864 --> 03:06:25,200
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1640
03:07:20,589 --> 03:07:23,633
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1641
03:08:06,718 --> 03:08:07,844
Run!

1642
03:11:39,431 --> 03:11:41,057
No.

1643
03:11:44,894 --> 03:11:47,939
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1644
03:11:48,273 --> 03:11:50,358
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1645
03:11:52,235 --> 03:11:53,653
I let Frodo go.

1646
03:11:54,362 --> 03:11:56,948
Then you did what I could not.

1647
03:11:57,949 --> 03:12:01,286
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1648
03:12:01,786 --> 03:12:06,082
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1649
03:12:06,291 --> 03:12:08,585
I did not see it.

1650
03:12:08,793 --> 03:12:11,963
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1651
03:12:12,422 --> 03:12:14,966
You fought bravely.

1652
03:12:15,258 --> 03:12:17,927
You have kept your honor.

1653
03:12:18,470 --> 03:12:20,430
Leave it.

1654
03:12:20,764 --> 03:12:22,807
It is over.

1655
03:12:23,975 --> 03:12:29,272
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness,

1656
03:12:29,689 --> 03:12:32,692
and my city to ruin.

1657
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:39,491
I do not know what strength
is in my blood,

1658
03:12:39,657 --> 03:12:43,661
but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall,

1659
03:12:44,662 --> 03:12:47,165
nor our people fail.

1660
03:12:48,166 --> 03:12:49,501
Our people.

1661
03:12:53,338 --> 03:12:55,465
Our people.

1662
03:13:17,195 --> 03:13:20,198
I would have followed you, my brother.

1663
03:13:21,741 --> 03:13:23,743
My captain.

1664
03:13:26,371 --> 03:13:28,331
My king.

1665
03:13:47,976 --> 03:13:50,228
Be at peace

1666
03:13:50,562 --> 03:13:52,564
son of Gondor.

1667
03:14:09,080 --> 03:14:12,417
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1668
03:14:12,917 --> 03:14:15,920
But he will not return.

1669
03:14:39,110 --> 03:14:41,112
Frodo!

1670
03:15:00,590 --> 03:15:03,843
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1671
03:15:05,136 --> 03:15:08,139
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1672
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:13,853
<i>So do all who live to see such times,</i>

1673
03:15:14,062 --> 03:15:17,482
<i>but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1674
03:15:17,649 --> 03:15:20,318
<i>All you have to decide</i>

1675
03:15:20,568 --> 03:15:25,323
is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1676
03:15:54,143 --> 03:15:56,187
Frodo, no!

1677
03:15:56,688 --> 03:15:58,022
Frodo!

1678
03:15:58,856 --> 03:16:01,526
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1679
03:16:05,029 --> 03:16:07,031
Go back, Sam!

1680
03:16:07,532 --> 03:16:11,119
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1681
03:16:11,327 --> 03:16:14,163
And I'm coming with you!

1682
03:16:14,622 --> 03:16:17,041
You can't swim!

1683
03:16:20,837 --> 03:16:22,547
Sam!

1684
03:16:28,136 --> 03:16:29,429
Sam!

1685
03:17:10,386 --> 03:17:13,097
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1686
03:17:13,431 --> 03:17:17,769
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1687
03:17:18,895 --> 03:17:21,481
And I don't mean to.

1688
03:17:21,773 --> 03:17:23,941
I don't mean to.

1689
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:27,445
Sam.

1690
03:17:42,293 --> 03:17:43,961
Come on.

1691
03:18:12,448 --> 03:18:16,994
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1692
03:18:31,843 --> 03:18:36,848
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1693
03:18:40,309 --> 03:18:45,189
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1694
03:18:57,034 --> 03:19:00,204
Not if we hold true to each other.

1695
03:19:01,539 --> 03:19:06,043
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1696
03:19:07,044 --> 03:19:12,300
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1697
03:19:13,551 --> 03:19:15,595
We travel light.

1698
03:19:15,803 --> 03:19:17,722
Let us hunt some Orc.

1699
03:19:20,683 --> 03:19:22,727
Yes!

1700
03:19:41,704 --> 03:19:43,122
Mordor.

1701
03:19:43,748 --> 03:19:47,126
I hope the others find a safer road.

1702
03:19:48,085 --> 03:19:50,630
Strider will look after them.

1703
03:19:51,589 --> 03:19:54,926
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1704
03:19:55,259 --> 03:19:57,720
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1705
03:19:57,929 --> 03:19:59,430
We may.

1706
03:20:01,557 --> 03:20:02,600
Sam...

1707
03:20:06,229 --> 03:20:08,856
I'm glad you are with me.
