1
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,251
Before Rome, before Babylon,

2
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,087
before the pyramids,
there was Kahndaq.

3
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,722
The first self-governing people
on Earth,

4
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,683
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

5
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,435
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,693
-But then...

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,364
...came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,870
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,538
But he had
even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,798
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,135
Ahk-Ton's real goal was
to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,850
If infused with the powers
of the six demons

13
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,144
-of the ancient world...

14
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,105
...it would make Ahk-Ton
invincible.

15
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,107
To make the crown,
he needed Eternium.

16
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,859
A rare mineral
of magic properties,

17
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,320
-found only in Kahndaq.

18
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,988
So he enslaved his own people

19
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,700
and forced them to dig.

20
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,090
Eternium.

21
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,264
Eternium.

22
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,566
Kahndaq was teetering
on the brink.

23
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,861
What they needed...

24
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,863
Get off him! Get off him!

25
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,116
Get off him! Get off him!

26
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,160
...was a hero.

27
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,205
Why are we fighting each other?

28
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,333
Remember who our real enemy is!
Come with me.

29
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,087
Look! Eternium.

30
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:52,881
Let me see that.

31
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,098
The King thanks you.

32
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,266
He's supposed to reward him.

33
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,059
Is that right?

34
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,394
I want what I'm owed.

35
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,479
Hmm.

36
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,484
You want a reward?

37
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,740
The King thanks you
for your service.

38
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,375
You want the king's reward, too?

39
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,963
No, but my son accepts
the king's mercy.

40
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,306
I won't always be here
to protect you.

41
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,100
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

42
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,020
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

43
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,480
Let someone else be the hero...

44
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,732
The graveyards are full of them.

45
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,443
Stop dreaming
and go back to work.

46
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,658
Someone to hold
the hopes of the people.

47
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,872
Even when all hope seems lost.

48
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,293
If we had more heroes...

49
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,046
then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream!

50
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,176
Freedom!

51
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,617
King Ahk-Ton knew
that this spark

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,327
could quickly ignite a fire.

53
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:48,038
And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.

54
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,877
They thought they were
getting a martyr.

55
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,214
Instead...

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,882
...they got a miracle.

57
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,519
The Council of Wizards,

58
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,312
the magical guardians
of the Earth...

59
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,565
You have been chosen.

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,899
...sought to restore
the balance.

61
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,568
The stamina of Shu!

62
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,570
They empowered him with
the gifts of the ancient gods.

63
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,529
- The swiftness of Heru!
- The strength of Amon!

64
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,905
And turned a boy...

65
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,407
The wisdom of Zehuti!

66
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,366
- The power of Aten!
- The courage of Mehen!

67
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,117
...into a champion.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,951
Shazam!

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,122
Hurry. Give it to me!

70
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,790
But the crown had
already been completed.

71
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:32,791
Give it to me!

72
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,962
And when The Champion
arrived at the palace

73
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,047
to challenge him...

74
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,258
King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

75
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,683
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,519
but The Champion was victorious.

77
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,480
The wizards hid
the Crown of Sabbac

78
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,483
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

79
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,444
And The Champion
was never heard from again.

80
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,702
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

81
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,914
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,503
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

83
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,507
The Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.

84
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,842
It has been a long, long wait.

85
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,690
Show me your papers.

86
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,696
Move it along!

87
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,198
Have your documentation ready.

88
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,661
It's all our
three documents, yeah?

89
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,995
Don't judge the picture,

90
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,955
it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me.

91
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,047
Open the back.
Need a look inside.

92
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,468
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

93
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,139
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

94
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,315
-Hey!

95
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,650
Watch where you're going.

96
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,443
You know the drill,
back of the line.

97
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,320
Come on, man,
you see me every day.

98
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,989
And every day I tell ya,

99
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,865
if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle.

100
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,367
Back of the line, mate.

101
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,535
You're not my mate.

102
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,664
I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

103
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,167
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

104
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,044
from halfway around the world,

105
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,589
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

106
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,091
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

107
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,509
oppress our heritage,

108
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,219
and make us wait in lines
all day.

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,933
-Hey, boss man. Can I go?

110
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,560
Hey!

111
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,482
Go on, get out of here.

112
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,026
-Yeah, yeah.

113
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,411
Adrianna, we're clear.

114
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,296
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

115
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,547
Let's just move the crown first,

116
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,882
and then we can
worry about safe.

117
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,675
I got Intergang
watching my house.

118
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,553
I gave up my job
at the university and moved four times.

119
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,430
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

120
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,183
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

121
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,352
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

122
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,438
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

123
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,654
- What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

124
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,072
You know it's too dangerous.

125
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,698
You shouldn't have
gotten involved.

126
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,368
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

127
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,286
Adrianna,
keep your head down, please.

128
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,205
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

129
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,165
Go home, do your homework.

130
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,294
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

131
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,379
Go!

132
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,255
Go, little man. You did good.

133
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,746
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

134
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,374
Is that real Eternium?

135
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,377
Show us a little magic.

136
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,587
It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined.

137
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,172
You guys should get some rest.

138
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,341
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

139
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,551
Hey, come on. Stop it.

140
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,844
I'm just curious how she got it.

141
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,721
My grandmother gave it to me.

142
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,307
- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

143
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,309
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

144
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,186
to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

145
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,689
You happy now?

146
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,940
Cool story.

147
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,779
And all I inherited
was a sweater.

148
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,490
That's not true. Baba left you
his van and his bald spot.

149
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,284
You know, some women
like a bald spot.

150
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,828
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

151
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,521
Are you sure about this?

152
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,440
The inscriptions
we found are clear.

153
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,234
And I'm positive
about that translation.

154
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,236
There is something
inside that mountain.

155
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,201
What if it really
is the crown? Then what?

156
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,244
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

157
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,247
No one. We hide it again
someplace else.

158
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,208
Get it out of the country
if we have to.

159
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,627
It is too dangerous
for anyone to have.

160
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:10,962
This is it?

161
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:12,923
Not yet.

162
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,303
- Are you coming?
- Eh, bad knee. I'll keep watch.

163
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,158
This way. Almost there.

164
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,584
"Men were given
the gift of magic,

165
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,546
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

166
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,969
Keep reading.

167
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,429
"The ultimate power
was banished from the Earth

168
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,682
and hidden... here."

169
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,269
Until now.

170
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,230
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

171
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,817
We're 100%, totally,
like, no take-backs

172
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,069
certain that we want to move it?

173
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:16,987
We don't have a choice.

174
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,407
What happened to Ishmael?

175
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,870
Great.
Don't worry, I'll find him.

176

♪ Baby, come back ♪

177
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,006

Samir?

182
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,315
Samir, what happened?

183
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,317
-What?

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,736
I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

185
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,616
Don't move! Unless you want
to join your mate.

186
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,493
Stay where you are!

187
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,038
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

188
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,668
- "Turn back."

189
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,048
-That's what it says, no?

190
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,633
Yes.

191
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,800
Where is Samir?

192
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,639
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

193
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,641
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

194
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,406
It's a tomb.

195
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,539
"Speak not his power,

196
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,125
so he may suffer
a dreamless sleep

197
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,169
"for all eternity." Teth Adam.

198
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,089
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

199
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
The legend was true.

200
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,761
Kahndaq...
really did have a hero once.

201
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,555
If he was such a hero,
why'd they bury him down here?

202
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,790
The crown.

203
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,586
It's over.

204
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,172
Now, give me the crown.

205
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,631
Run, Addy! Run!

206
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,636
-Hold fire!

207
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,181
Don't hit the crown! Get her!

208
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,685
- Go! Move.
- Circle around!

209
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,479
-Get down!

210
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,904
-Say goodbye to your brother.

211
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,989
In five...

212
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,699
-four...

213
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,617
three...

214
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:51,993
two...

215
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,204
one...

216
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,498
I'm over here.

217
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,292
One? You let them get to one?

218
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,769
Any last words?

219
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,940
Please tell my son...

220
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,737
"Mightiest of mortals,

221
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,406
god of gods,

222
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,326
"-Six Immortal Elders by name..."
-What?

223
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,662
- "Shazam!"

224
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,550
Who the hell is that?

225
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,969
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

226
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,155
Check him out.

227
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,656
Boss say you go.

228
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,032
Chief say your turn.

229
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,173
Hey, amigo.
Let me see your hands.

230
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,574
Open fire!

231
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,456
Your magic is weak.

232
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,340
Go.

233
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,786
We need immediate backup!
Send everything you've got!

234
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,174
Ishmael!

235
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,643
Ishmael!

236
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,296
Let's go!

237
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,797
This is as fast as I can go.

238
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,953
Samir! What happened?

239
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,080
What didn't happen!

240
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,790
Samir fell off of a cliff.

241
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,752
I had a gun to my head.

242
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,628
Ishmael is buried
under a mountain.

243
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,965
And you summoned
some flying magic man.

244
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,051
All for what? Nothing!

245
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,970
- Oh.
- Not for nothing.

246
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,114
Light him up.

247
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,588
Shit! Where the hell
did he come from?

248
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,672
Rotor out! Go! Go!

249
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,301
-I can't maintain altitude!

Stop! Stop the van!

263
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,020
Behind you!

264
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,399
Did he just catch a rocket?

265
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,020
God willing,
we won't see him again.

266
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,869
Wait. Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

267
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,496
Don't touch him,
he's made of lightning.

268
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,957
Good point.

269
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,208
You get him,
you're the electrician.

270
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,843
Raptor team, come in.

271
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:29,885
What's your status?

272
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,224
Help me.

273
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,894
I told you to make it look
real, not punch me in the face.

274
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,316
Raptor team, come in.

275
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,609
What's your status?

276
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,777
Status is that everyone is dead.

277
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,405
Ishmael, is that you?
What happened?

278
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,451
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

279
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,703
- Do you have it?
- No.

280
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,079
But I know who does.

281
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,165
Copy that. We're en route
to your location.

282
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,877
We need immediate backup.

283
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,462
Send everything you've got!

284
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,504
This rare, magical mineral

285
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,298
has been mined for centuries...

286
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,674
...reports of an Eternium blast.

287
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,468
It is unknown who or why...

288
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,011
...decimated a number of troops.

289
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,804
...an unidentified male.

290
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,723
This being is
somehow able to harness...

291
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,308
What do you think?

292
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,852
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down

293
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,937
before innocent people
start getting hurt.

294
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,856
Oh, and good morning
to you, too.

295
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,650
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

296
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,361
He's been asleep
for 5,000 years.

297
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,739
He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,

298
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,991
the harder it will be
to take him down.

299
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,619
Wheels up in 30.

300
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,454
Who's on the team?

301
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,590
-Welcome.

302
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,425
Please state your name
for identification.

303
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,012
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

304
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,722
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

305
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,224
Thanks!

306
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,351
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

307
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:04,271
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

308
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:08,067
Basically a tornado
with a 167 IQ.

309
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,610
Sounds delightful.

310
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,987
But please tell me
you found someone

311
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,406
who can pack a punch.

312
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,908
That's where Atom Smasher
comes in.

313
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,828
Al Rothstein, nephew
to the original Atom Smasher.

314
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,454
-Inherited his uncle's powers.

315
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,458
- How's my suit? Does it fit?
- No, yeah. It's perfect.

316
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,168
Thank you again
for letting me borrow it.

317
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,212
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

318
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,965
This is literally
the only thing that I'd ever wanted in my...

319
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,883
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let
anything happen to it.

320
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,427
It's vintage.

321
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,178
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

322
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,680
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

323
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,224
I'm gonna make you proud,
Uncle Al. I promise.

324
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,728
They seem green.

325
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,396
That's why I called in Kent.

326
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,900
Kent's been
out of action for a little while,

327
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,986
but I can't do this without him.

328
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,779
Takes magic to fight magic,

329
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,115
and the man's got
nearly god-level powers.

330
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,081
It might take
a lot more than that.

331
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,041
Are you sure they can take him?

332
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,253
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him,

333
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,046
we'll take care of the rest.

334
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,964
Good luck.

335
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,180
This is gonna be fun.

336
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,699
- We're here, sir.
- Hmm? Oh, right.

337
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,538
Was I staring again?

338
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,956
Only half an hour or so, sir.

339
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,918
Maybe next time, honk the horn?

340
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,044
Of course, sir.

341
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,728
So what's the op?

342
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,396
We're headed to
Kahndaq to apprehend and contain

343
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,148
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

344
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,733
I didn't bring a passport.

345
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:16,737
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

346
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,831
Is this entirely
made out of Nth metal?

347
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,250
Everything down to the screws.

348
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,752
Completely indestructible.

349
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,462
I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

350
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,633
It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

351
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,388
It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms.

352
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,902
Here.

353
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,154
Oh! Thanks.

354
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,783
I'm Al, by the way.

355
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:03,868
Maxine.

356
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,916
What do you do?

357
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,877
Wind. You?

358
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,794
I grow.

359
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:15,838
Cool.

360
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,576
Whoa!

361
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,551
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

362
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,182
Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

363
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,892
but you should probably
leave the...

364
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,479
Or do that.

365
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,151
I know you have a lot
to catch up on.

366
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,195
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

367
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,447
- Move.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

368
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,115
I didn't ask for your name.

369
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,492
You're Teth Adam, right?

370
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,118
Everyone in Kahndaq
knows your story.

371
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,912
- I said move.
- My mom said you took out

372
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,747
a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

373
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,290
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

374
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,000
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

375
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,877
'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

376
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,379
And is it really you stopping
the bullets or is it the suit?

377
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,089
Wait, what's your top speed?

378
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,382
I'm sure you're fast,
but how fast? Like Flash fast?

379
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,724
Wait, did you really
not have mirrors back then?

380
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,728
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

381
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,191
Five thousand years?

382
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,651
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

383
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,611
Until my mom woke you up.

384
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,239
So you've got stopping bullets,
check, flying, check

385
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,991
and lightning thing,
that's a big check.

386
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,289
I don't know this place.

387
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,958
This is your home.

388
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:20,838
Then my home is gone.

389
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,230
What happened to the crown?

390
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,899
-Too much?

391
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,780
You know it's cursed
with demons, right?

392
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:01,003
"Life is the...
only path to death."

393
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,881
No shit.

394
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,846
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-god.

395
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,975
He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

396
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,643
There. That's you. See?

397
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:17,936
That's the statue
they built of you.

398
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,730
And now you're back.

399
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,190
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

400
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,484
ever since you left.

401
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,236
My point is,
Kahndaq still isn't free.

402
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,739
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

403
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,366
I'm no hero.

404
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,744
What?
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...

405
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,746
You're way more stacked
than any of them.

406
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,123
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

407
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,417
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

408
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,710
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

409
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,170
You're our only hope.

410
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,905
-Wizards.

411
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,365
I can fix it. Don't worry.

412
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,494
I'm not a wizard.

413
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,957
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

414
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,416
I told you
not to go in your room.

415
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,794
It was you who spoke.

416
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,090
You woke me.

417
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,342
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

418
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,177
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

419
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,513
- Yes.
- Then your enemies are vanquished,

420
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,515
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

421
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,017
Actually, we still have
a lot of enemies that need vanquishing.

422
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,853
Then destroy them.

423
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,063
Intergang have
guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets.

424
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,106
We have my mom.

425
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,234
Prove your strength.

426
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,902
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

427
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,279
Make him beg for mercy,

428
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,281
but deny it
until his final breath.

429
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,116
Interesting, okay?

430
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,784
I appreciate
what you did for me,

431
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,037
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

432
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,040
I understand.

433
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,084
You want his father to teach him violence.

434
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,003
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

435
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,172
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

436
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,300
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

437
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,011
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

438
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,679
No one.

439
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,641
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

440
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,519
Please, help us.

441
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,830
Wait! Wait.

442
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,293
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

443
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,545
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

444
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,047
Not really, no.

445
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,590
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

446
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,592
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

447
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,677
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

448
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,262
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

449
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,555
get a cape, change your name.

450
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,432
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

451
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,850
It's a little outdated.

452
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,268
And you definitely need
a catchphrase.

453
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,895
Something blackout bad-ass
to say

454
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,147
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

455
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,690
I don't waste words on the dead.

456
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,400
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

457
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,069
I was thinking, like,

458
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,071
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

459
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,656
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

460
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,783
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

461
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,660
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

462
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,287
My point is,
you could be famous.

463
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,414
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

464
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,417
And the superhero
industrial complex is worth a lot of money.

465
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,211
I don't need a box for my lunch.

466
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,213
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

467
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,009
What else are you gonna do?

468
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,474
Wait! Where are you going?

469
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,993
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

470
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,744
Most of this was
considered a myth

471
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,621
until yesterday afternoon.

472
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,499
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

473
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,127
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

474
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,087
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

475
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,216
What are you laughing at?

476
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,677
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

477
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,388
I know. That's how you laugh.

478
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,723
I've missed having you around

479
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,767
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

480
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,894
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

481
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,480
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

482
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,775
This is not a very good plan.

483
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,823
Yeah, well...

484
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,075
A bad plan is better
than no plan at all.

485
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,912
If only there were
a third option.

486
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,460
I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

487
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,004
Why not?

488
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,547
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

489
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,923
It's millions of years old.

490
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,633
It chooses who it lets touch it.

491
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,887
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

492
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,349
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

493
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,767
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

494
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,103
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

495
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,898
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

496
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,274
Coming up on it.

497
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,693
Ready stations in five.

498
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,154
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

499
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,489
He's not some dude.

500
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,700
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

501
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,786
You don't have to
raise your hand.

502
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,288
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

503
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,291
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,".

504
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,460
Teth Adam will lose his power.

505
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,878
And we're hoping since he's had

506
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,339
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

507
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,759
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

508
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,886
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

509
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,846
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

510
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,181
Correct.

511
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,224
Look alive.

512
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:50,977
We're here.

513
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,104
Forgive me.

514
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,369
This is a message

515
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,912
- for all Intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

516
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,248
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

517
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,482
Teth Adam!

518
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,611
Please.

519
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,697
-There he is! Move!

520
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,449
- Teth Adam!
- Move!

521
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,576
-Teth Adam...

522
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,580
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

523
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,584
The statue?

524
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,379
That's my son.

525
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,590
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

526
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,634
What are you doing?

527
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,304
Hang on. I recognize you.

528
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,014
Where is the crown?

529
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,892
-Let's go!

530
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,699
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

531
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:10,742
But that was dope.

532
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,499
We need backup down here.

533
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,458
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

534
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,420
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

535
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,589
But before you zap them.

536
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,424
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

537
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,072
He's here.

538
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,449
You sense his presence?

539
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,784
No.

540
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,079
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

541
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,384
Fate and I'll take
the lead. Listen...

542
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,803
Now, you two hang back
till we call you.

543
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,513
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

544
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,265
You're ready.

545
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,933
-Uh, he just dropped the, um...

546
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,810
-Shit!

547
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,901
Be prepared.

548
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,493
Um...

549
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,048
Behind you!

550
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,938
Let us be!

551
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,817
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

552
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,777
these men should face
due process.

553
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,783
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

554
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,201
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

555
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,495
You don't look like
an Intergang.

556
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,039
We're the Justice Society.

557
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:06,334
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

558
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,838
We're here to restore peace
to Kahndaq.

559
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,966
And we will use force
if necessary.

560
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,928
Force is always necessary.

561
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,555
Teth Adam.

562
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:22,142
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

563
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,686
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

564
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,272
You have two choices.

565
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,733
Kneel or die.

566
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,902
I was a slave until I died.

567
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,114
Then I was reborn a god.

568
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,076
I kneel before no one.

569
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,210
Fate, give me a distraction.

570
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,308
Just say, "Shazam."
We all go home.

571
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,937
I don't have a home.

572
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:22,804
Whoo!

573
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,305
Look at that suit. It's cool.

574
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,182
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

575
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,184
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

576
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,359
Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

577
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,235
Nope.

578
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,834
Amon, where are you going? Wait!

579
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,085
To help him!

580
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,525
Cyclone, Smasher,
now is your time.

581
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,319
-Let's roll!

582
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,695
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

583
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:03,905
No!

584
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,453
I'll be right there!

585
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,965
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

586
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,676
I can't hold him much longer.

587
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,516
Move!

588
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,914
I'm coming!
I'm zeroing in on your location!

589
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,325
I got him! Guys, I got him.

590
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:15,578
It's, uh... it's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

591
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,121
There's something different
about you.

592
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,873
Can't quite put my finger on it.

593
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,666
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

594
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,210
But you, you're like a tornado.

595
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,837
I thought the two of you
did great work.

596
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,839
First time out... Bravo.

597
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,258
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

598
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,718
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

599
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,428
You're damn right it did.

600
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,097
Let's hope Waller has
that cell ready for him.

601
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,647
You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

602
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,315
You'd better not let him up.

603
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,611
Uh... what do I... What do I do?
Guys?

604
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,574
Woo-hoo!

605
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,922
Long live The Champion!

606
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,258
Long live The Champion!

607
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,385
Long live The Champion!

608
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,679
Long live The Champion!

609
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,565
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

610
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,902
Long live The Champion!

611
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,381
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

612
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,633
We're not strong enough.

613
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,344
Oh, well, maybe next time use your
powers of prediction to figure that out

614
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,013
before we get our asses kicked.

615
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,681
I'm working on it.

616
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,183
Miss?

617
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,851
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

618
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,186
Yes, I do mind.

619
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,687
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

620
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,189
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

621
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,940
One catastrophe at a time.

622
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,400
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

623
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,277
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

624
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,404
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

625
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,198
Why do you want
Teth Adam to surrender?

626
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,408
He's The Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

627
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,410
The Justice Society?

628
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,746
We have been living
under military occupation

629
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,415
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

630
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,126
You didn't come
when Intergang invaded our country,

631
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,795
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

632
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,381
But now, we finally
have our own hero

633
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,718
and you decide
to fly down here and save us?

634
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,095
Thank you, but... we're covered.

635
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,766
Go and protect
international stability someplace else.

636
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,518
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

637
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,520
Let me spell it out for you.

638
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,564
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion

639
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,107
because he is not a hero.

640
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,318
Tell that...

641
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,322
to all the people
he just liberated.

642
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,741
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

643
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,117
But I can assure you that my...

644
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:06,165
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

645
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,127
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

646
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,129
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

647
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,089
I...

648
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,133
Can we please
just see the crown?

649
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,010
I don't have it.

650
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,114
We don't have time for this.

651
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,199
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

652
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,702
You don't have
any authority here.

653
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,995
Teth Adam has done nothing...

654
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,747
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

655
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,249
And how would you know?

656
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,917
We have access to ancient texts

657
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,877
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

658
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:54,547
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

659
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,884
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

660
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,303
And we flew
all the way over here

661
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,680
to stop it from happening again.

662
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,226
You want to go in there alone?

663
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,103
Are you sure?

664
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,772
You want to go in
and fight Teth Adam again, be my guest.

665
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,191
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

666
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,235
without destroying
the rest of my city,

667
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,236
I'm your only shot.

668
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,428
You brought
the invaders with you.

669
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,638
They only want to talk.

670
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,017
They can talk. I won't listen.

671
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,313
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story

672
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,358
of how The Champion came
to this exact spot

673
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,193
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

674
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,403
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

675
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,489
But according
to the Justice Society,

676
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,366
that's not really what happened.

677
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,035
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

678
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,081
Hurry. Give it to me!

679
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,296
That you came to exact revenge.

680
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,522
And in your anger...

681
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:42,071
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

682
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,948
This is what I want.

683
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,742
...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

684
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:57,044
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

685
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,296
of the gifts that
you were granted.

686
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,382
We have chosen recklessly...

687
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,759
and humanity has paid the price.

688
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:07,054
And now, Teth Adam...
you must pay.

689
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,285
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

690
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,831
It was your prison.

691
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,252
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

692
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,006
Out of the hope that
someday Kahndaq's champion would return.

693
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,716
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

694
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,801
I never said I was a hero.

695
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,095
I never claimed to be anything.

696
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,639
You may not have been a hero.

697
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:53,225
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

698
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,276
I will hear them out.

699
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,487
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

700
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,244
Uncle Karim!

701
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,537
I can't believe
you're sitting around watching TV

702
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,914
when the most epic day ever is...

703
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,249
-In here, little man.

704
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,462
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

705
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,796
Funny story, he didn't.

706
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,049
-Where's Adrianna?

707
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,342
She's back at the square...

708
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,510
We should go bail her out
right now.

709
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,636
But she's the one
who sent me home

710
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,887
to make sure the crown's safe.

711
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,555
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

712
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,141
Definitely not here. Let...

713
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,601
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

714
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,270
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

715
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,192
Give him the bag.

716
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:45,945
Very good. Back away.

717
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,156
- Back away.
- Okay, I'm...

718
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,293
It's all going
to be okay, little man.

719
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,462
Let me teach you
some history that you've never learned

720
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,005
in one of your mother's classes.

721
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,757
When we had a powerful king,

722
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,177
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

723
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,720
It used to be great.

724
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,347
Run, Amon, run!

725
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,325
Crash the building.

726
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,077
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

727
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,053
We're here
to negotiate the terms

728
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,598
of your peaceful surrender.

729
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,934
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

730
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,228
What have
your powers ever given to you?

731
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,397
Nothing but heartache.

732
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,940
You have no idea.

733
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:06,650
Then why are you
making this hard on us?

734
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,777
We both know you're not
supposed to be here.

735
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,488
It is you who is not supposed
to be here.

736
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,824
I want you all
to leave Kahndaq and never return.

737
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,745
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

738
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,372
How 'bout I rip
your little wings off instead?

739
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,333
I'd like to see you try.

740
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,834
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

741
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,419
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

742
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,962
Looks like we found
common ground.

743
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,839
This can only end one way.

744
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:31,884
- Mom?
- Amon.

745
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,802
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

746
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,304
Ishmael's dead.

747
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,139
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

748
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,309
Ground forces...

749
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,311
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

750
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,104
They're coming!

751
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,190
Intergang are after my son.

752
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,443
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

753
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,736
I know you're not a hero.

754
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,945
But you're not a monster,
either.

755
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,238
I don't care what anyone says.

756
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,658
You saved me in that cave.

757
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,661
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

758
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,372
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

759
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:07,211
Check the whole place clean.

760
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,380
Cover all access points!

761
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,799
-Keep looking!

762
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,182
Area's clear.

763
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,268
There! There!
Take him! Take him!

764
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:24,770
Right there, right there!

765
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:28,899
Move, move!

766
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,485
Don't shoot him, I need him!

767
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,704
He's going down,
he's going down!

768
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,713
End of the road, kid!

769
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,847
Release the child.

770
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,348
-Whatever you say.

771
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,311
Yes! Thank you!

772
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,148
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

773
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,403
Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!

774
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,243
Time to go, Amon.

775
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,127
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

776
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,755
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

777
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:34,214
That's the plan, little man.

778
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:36,008
We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

779
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,858
Put me down! Put me down!

780
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,068
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

781
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,695
-And tell them that the Man in Black...

782
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,370
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

783
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,174
Mom?

784
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:20,052
Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?

785
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,845
I'm in one of their bikes.

786
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:22,888
What bikes?

787
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,283
Amon!

788
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:44,201
Can you hear me?

789
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,452
Mom, I'm okay.

790
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:52,960
Shit!

791
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,926
Activate infrared.

792
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,058
What are you doing?

793
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,518
Searching for the child.

794
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,894
No, you're murdering people.

795
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,604
How else do I find the child?

796
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:14,857
I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings.

797
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,692
I don't need any help.

798
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,404
Smasher, Cyclone!

799
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,905
What are you waiting for?

800
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,074
- Come on, let's go!
- Uh, okay.

801
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,243
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

802
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,995
One, two...

803
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,205
This feels a lot higher
than last time.

804
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,332
Whoa!

805
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,667
Ah! That was not cool!

806
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,094
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

807
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,721
Hey, guys. Slow down.

808
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,435
-I got you! I got you!

809
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:13,165
Hey, careful, dude!
I almost hit you.

810
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,756
I am so sorry. I just...

811
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,090
I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask.

812
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,842
It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored.

813
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,177
Me and you.

814
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,386
Roger that.

815
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,308
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

816
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:16,853
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

817
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,522
I'm not that kind of doctor.

818
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,232
But don't worry,
I can see the future.

819
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,359
This isn't how you're
going to die.

820
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:23,694
How do I die, then?

821
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,487
Just stay away from electricity.

822
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,573
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

823
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:29,825
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

824
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:40,353
Oh, God.

825
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,481
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

826
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,440
I'm counting on it.

827
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,870
Please don't.

828
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,705
Teth Adam. Where are you?

829
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:59,790
You followed me?

830
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,583
My mind and body can exist

831
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,668
in different places
at the same time.

832
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,337
Did you find the boy?

833
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,922
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

834
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,508
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

835
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,592
Uh...

836
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:14,054
You killed him, didn't you?

837
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:22,104
He didn't make it.

838
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,358
The bullet's extracted.

839
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,401
The tissue damage
has been repaired.

840
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,864
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

841
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,157
He'll be back on his feet
in no time.

842
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:37,410
That is insane.

843
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,914
The nanobots did
most of the work.

844
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,208
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

845
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,293
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

846
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:48,630
What? I say something stupid?

847
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,508
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

848
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,301
grow a hundred times
your own size.

849
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,512
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

850
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,097
-I don't know, it's...

851
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,015
It's cool.

852
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,394
Thank you.

853
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,770
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

854
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,233
That's how you do
your wind thing.

855
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,902
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

856
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,863
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

857
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,406
by this really
messed-up scientist

858
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,866
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

859
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,580
I'm... so sorry.

860
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,166
No, you're good.

861
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,001
It seems like you
really turned it around.

862
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,419
Found your calling.

863
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:29,880
Hoping this is mine.

864
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,305
There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

865
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,726
It's already moved on from you.

866
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:48,481
Why did you say that?

867
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,109
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

868
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:54,362
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

869
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:55,530
not those you can't.

870
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:58,658
You see the future?

871
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,535
Tell me how I get my son back.

872
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,121
By trusting us.

873
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:06,499
Karim will live.
We will save Amon.

874
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,667
It's what we do.

875
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,217
I suppose
they didn't have doors in your day.

876
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,637
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

877
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,722
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

878
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,974
Where is Amon? Did you find him?

879
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:24,267
Not yet, but I will.

880
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,602
The men who took him
will suffer.

881
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,396
Maybe these guys can help.

882
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,151
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

883
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,028
They can answer our questions.

884
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,488
What did you do with my son?

885
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,749
-Adrianna. Adrianna.

886
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,459
I've learned that
in this modern world,

887
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,961
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

888
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,504
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

889
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,049
No.

890
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,968
Let's start with
just one simple question.

891
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,887
-Can either of you fly?

892
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,472
-Shit.

893
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,642
I think I'll sit this one out.

894
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,610
Tell me what you did with Amon.

895
01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:17,904
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

896
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,447
I'm not going to drop them.

897
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,076
I'm going to drop one of them.

898
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,537
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

899
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,205
I don't know.

900
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:35,213
He's at our mine in the desert.

901
01:09:35,297 --> 01:09:36,756
I can show...

902
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,930
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

903
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,892
You said you wouldn't hurt
the prisoners.

904
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,769
That was sarcasm.

905
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,230
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

906
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:53,648
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

907
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,025
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

908
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,319
It's near
the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

909
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:58,403
Let's go.

910
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:02,115
I told you, stop killing people!

911
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,116
They look alive to me.

912
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,076
Because I saved them.

913
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,828
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

914
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,955
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

915
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,333
I did it your way.

916
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,459
He does have a point.

917
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,795
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

918
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,590
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

919
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,175
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

920
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,885
There is no "we" here.

921
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,013
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

922
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,849
You think yourself a hero,

923
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,476
but you would let
these criminals go free,

924
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,561
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

925
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,729
unless we end them now.

926
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,482
Heroes don't kill people.

927
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:40,195
Well, I do.

928
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:42,864
Here we go.

929
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,303
Is that what I think it is?

930
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:49,305
Twenty-three pounds
of pure Eternium,

931
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,808
much denser than
typical artifacts of the period.

932
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,643
King must have had
a really strong neck.

933
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,520
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

934
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,149
What's that?

935
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:00,733
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

936
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,944
"Life is the only path
to death."

937
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,155
That's what it says.

938
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,408
"Life is the only path
to death."

939
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,536
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

940
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,288
Could it have another meaning?

941
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,331
What if it means, like, um...

942
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,625
"Life is short.

943
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,002
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

944
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:21,963
Stop.

945
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:23,756
Deep.

946
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,425
It doesn't matter what it means.

947
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,218
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

948
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:29,012
That's not far from what
we had in mind

949
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,513
for you when this is over.

950
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:32,015
Or I could bury you with it.

951
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,518
We can't get rid of it now.

952
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:37,228
It's the one thing
that Intergang wants.

953
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:40,023
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

954
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,649
what this crown is capable of.

955
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:44,736
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

956
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,029
Adrianna...

957
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,864
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

958
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,658
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

959
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:51,951
Hand it over.

960
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,248
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

961
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,335
We'll find another way.

962
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,463
No.

963
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,174
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

964
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:09,636
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

965
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,596
All I care about is Amon.

966
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,767
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

967
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,978
And you...
You will work together.

968
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,239
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

969
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:30,615
We'll go in at dawn.

970
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,910
I hope you can be a team player.

971
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,162
I love teams.

972
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,830
That was sarcasm again, yes?

973
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:38,831
Very much so.

974
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,251
Good. Just checking.

975
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:54,222
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

976
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:55,723
is better than no plan at all.

977
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,977
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

978
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,979
Let it go.

979
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,565
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

980
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,483
He's a murderer, Kent.

981
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:08,945
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

982
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:11,990
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

983
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,326
That's... up to fate.

984
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,869
What's the helmet telling you?

985
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,122
Somebody's gonna die.

986
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:23,293
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

987
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,502
Surprisingly, no.

988
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,588
Is it me?

989
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,514
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

990
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:40,768
All I can tell you is,

991
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,315
there's still time
to change the future.

992
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:47,650
Let's use it.

993
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:49,569
Hmm.

994
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:56,075
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

995
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:09,881
The Al Hadidiyah Mine

996
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,509
is Intergang's
most valued asset.

997
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:14,927
I'm gonna land us right here,

998
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,138
cut off their access
to reinforcements.

999
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,224
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

1000
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:22,769
There's only one way in,
one way out.

1001
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,520
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

1002
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,314
Communication is key.

1003
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,816
We keep in step
or we get outflanked.

1004
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,110
We move through the mine,
inch by inch,

1005
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,695
until we find Amon.

1006
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,280
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

Unbreakable,
even with your powers.

1016
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:20,993
Amon!

1017
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,745
You hurt him,
I will kill all of you.

1018
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:25,665
Nobody has to die.
We just want the crown.

1019
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,709
We don't have it.

1020
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,754
Believe me, nothing good
will come from that crown.

1021
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:36,217
No crown, no negotiation.

1022
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:38,469
I have it.

1023
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,765
It's right here.

1024
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,601
Release my son, you can have it.

1025
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:50,064
What do you think you're doing?

1026
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,152
Intergang killed my husband.

1027
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,987
I'm not letting them
take my son, too.

1028
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,203
Not your son. Not your country.

1029
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,039
Not your decision to make.

1030
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,001
Stop there!

1031
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,879
It's okay.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1032
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,088
Hand it over, now.

1033
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,382
I'm sorry, Mom.

1034
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:17,550
No.

1035
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,807
Now, let Amon go.

1036
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,940
I thank you.
And I thank your friends

1037
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,819
for returning the crown
to its rightful owner.

1038
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:40,573
What kind of champion of
Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?

1039
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,908
You have what you want.

1040
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,368
Let him go.

1041
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:45,745
Ishmael, what are you doing?

1042
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,539
Taking back what's mine.

1043
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:51,501
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

1044
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,170
And you have just given me
everything I need

1045
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:57,799
to become the next
king of Kahndaq.

1046
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,427
My family passed
the knowledge on, you know,

1047
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:03,221
one to the next.

1048
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,516
The crown,
crafted by our ancestors,

1049
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,268
stolen by the wizards
and hidden away.

1050
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,145
But still a source
of great power,

1051
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,773
if only we can wield it.

1052
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:23,491
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

1053
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,452
I wonder if you'll
do the same for them.

1054
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,495
Please, Ishmael.

1055
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,746
Sorry, Amon.

1056
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,916
Fate, get ready.

1057
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,088
Death is the only path to life.

1058
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,343
Amon!

1059
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:49,702
Amon!

1060
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,624
He's alive.

1061
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,417
But we need to get him
to the medical bay.

1062
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,085
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

1063
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,045
It was me.

1064
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,263
Come.

1065
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,192
We're going with you.

1066
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,402
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

1067
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,126
I found the crown.
But, um... it's not alone.

1068
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,598
How long we gonna
keep doing this?

1069
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,522
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

1070
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,358
You're right.

1071
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,861
Only you can.

1072
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:08,698
Ishmael said you cried
when Hurut died.

1073
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,662
Who's Hurut?

1074
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,086
Hurut was a true champion
of Kahndaq.

1075
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,344
And he was also... my son.

1076
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,807
I won't always be here to protect you.

1077
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,185
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

1078
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,188
Freedom is for the birds.

1079
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,233
Let someone else be the hero...

1080
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:47,236
The graveyards are full of them.

1081
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:53,951
I tried to protect him.

1082
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,918
But I wasn't strong enough.

1083
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:11,010
Shazam!

1084
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,847
The wizards
decided that he would be their champion.

1085
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,266
But after The Champion's
many victories,

1086
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:20,227
the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.

1087
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,356
- Our family.

1088
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:45,211
Hold on, father. Stay with me.

1089
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:57,098
With my powers...
you'll be safe.

1090
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,100
I couldn't protect your mother.

1091
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,520
Repeat what I say.

1092
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,605
-Shazam.

1093
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,745
Instead of battling the king...

1094
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,748
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

1095
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,876
Hurut chose to save...

1096
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:28,087
me.

1097
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,439
But he couldn't save himself

1098
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,900
from the king's assassins.

1099
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,030
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

1100
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,032
...but a curse.

1101
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:09,879
Born... out of rage.

1102
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,800
The statue of The Champion
isn't you.

1103
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,138
It's Hurut.

1104
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:24,185
My son dreamt of a better world.

1105
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:26,979
That's why he saved me.

1106
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,069
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1107
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:51,754
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1108
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,132
Instead, it got me.

1109
01:24:58,135 --> 01:24:59,470
All this power...

1110
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:04,516
And the only thing
I can do with it is hurt people.

1111
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,102
I will speak the word
my son gave me,

1112
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:08,604
and I will give up my power.

1113
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:14,944
And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again.

1114
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,117
Shazam.

1115
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,587
Some men
are not meant... to be heroes.

1116
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,134
Hey!

1117
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:40,279
So beautiful.

1118
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,307
Surprised to see us?

1119
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,393
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1120
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:12,978
Are you sure you can handle him?

1121
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,898
You're the one who can
see the future,

1122
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,232
you'll tell me if we can't.

1123
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,777
Just be careful with this one.

1124
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,279
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1125
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:24,782
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1126
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,160
Waller sends her regards.

1127
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,211
They'll know
how to deal with him.

1128
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,922
To keep him
from regaining his powers,

1129
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,840
they'll keep him
in suspended animation.

1130
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,810
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1131
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,441
He'll never say
another word again.

1132
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,422
Hey! There he is.

1133
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:25,092
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1134
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,802
-Well, statistically,

1135
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,971
most heroes don't wear capes.
But, yeah, try it on.

1136
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,643
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1137
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,981
That's a nice touch.

1138
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:20,439
Kent.

1139
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:23,317
-Kent!

1140
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:27,779
Mission accomplished?

1141
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,157
My vision hasn't changed.

1142
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,409
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1143
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:35,162
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1144
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:36,872
What is the helmet telling you?

1145
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:41,793
My vision has always shown me
a great calamity.

1146
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,921
The world in flames.

1147
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:45,297
We can stop it...

1148
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,133
but you die.

1149
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:51,887
You should've told me sooner.

1150
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:57,100
I have no fear of death.

1151
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,186
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1152
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:01,522
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1153
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,440
The world needs you.

1154
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:06,443
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1155
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:07,444
That's fate, right?

1156
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,324
That sounds familiar.

1157
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,204
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1158
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,961
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1159
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:26,255
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1160
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,590
Mmm.

1161
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:29,758
But I didn't cheer.

1162
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,429
Even though I was only a boy.

1163
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:39,017
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1164
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:40,519
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1165
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,771
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1166
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,439
I've seen the world change

1167
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,483
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1168
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,613
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1169
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,908
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1170
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:08,005
Ishmael said, "Death
is the only path to life."

1171
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:10,299
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1172
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,677
Right. "Life is
the only path to death."

1173
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,178
Maybe he got it backwards,

1174
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:17,514
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1175
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:19,099
That's it.

1176
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,476
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1177
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,645
are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1178
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:25,814
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1179
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,649
Here, turn the crown around.

1180
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:30,611
Now mirror the letters.

1181
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,739
See? That's what I missed.

1182
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,826
"Death is
the only path to life."

1183
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,082
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1184
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,668
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1185
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:48,795
And he believed
The Champion's magic

1186
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,714
would send him
to the Rock of Finality.

1187
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:54,343
As life is the path to death.

1188
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:58,180
Now your death
is a path to life.

1189
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,349
The wizards have their champion,

1190
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,559
now we have ours.

1191
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:05,395
You will take
the throne of Kahndaq

1192
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:09,524
and unleash hell on Earth!

1193
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:11,693
Speak our name.

1194
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:13,236
"Sabbac."

1195
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,718
What the bloody hell is that?

1196
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,512
Readout says
it's the demon, Sabbac.

1197
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,931
Get me closer. Now, right now!

1198
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,724
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1199
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:55,612
The king has returned!
The throne will be mine!

1200
01:32:58,115 --> 01:32:59,324
Brace yourselves!

1201
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:06,415
Hold on!

1202
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:44,703
Now prepare to die.

1203
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,127
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1204
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:12,147
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1205
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:17,194
- Copy that.
- We're on it!

1206
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:18,069
Heads up!

1207
01:35:03,073 --> 01:35:04,157
Activate infrared.

1208
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:09,746
Sabbac, show yourself!

1209
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,001
-Adrianna! Amon!

1210
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,841
That's for my cruiser.

1211
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,463
This is it.

1212
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,592
We can't win, Carter.

1213
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:06,678
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1214
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,182
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1215
01:36:38,168 --> 01:36:40,170
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1216
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,047
Giving us a third option.

1217
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,548
It's supposed to be me.

1218
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,759
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1219
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,219
I did see your death.

1220
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:50,680
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1221
01:36:50,764 --> 01:36:52,807
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1222
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,226
but always with one foot
in the future.

1223
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,521
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1224
01:36:58,605 --> 01:36:59,773
when I look ahead...

1225
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:03,735
I see nothing.

1226
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:04,819
No, Kent.

1227
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:05,779
And...

1228
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:07,864
it's...

1229
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:09,699
beautiful.

1230
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:10,825
Wait, Kent!

1231
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:12,035
Goodbye...

1232
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:13,828
Kent!

1233
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:14,996
...my dear friend.

1234
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,164
Kent!

1235
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:20,335
Hit it from every side.

1236
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,464
Kent!

1237
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:28,259
No!

1238
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:53,118
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1239
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:56,246
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1240
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,832
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1241
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:11,302
There's no one
that can defeat me.

1242
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:19,477
There is one... There is one...

1243
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:21,229
Teth Adam.

1244
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:24,232
I know you can hear me.

1245
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,988
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1246
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,365
Now you are the only one

1247
01:38:32,449 --> 01:38:34,659
who can defeat
the Demon Champion.

1248
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,187
You have the power

1249
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,397
to be the destroyer
of this world.

1250
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,320
But you can also be its savior.

1251
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:30,173
You believe
you are not a worthy champion

1252
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:32,842
because the wizards
did not choose you.

1253
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:36,638
But fate does not
make mistakes. Neither did your son.

1254
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:42,435
We were wrong about you.

1255
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:45,772
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1256
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,857
Sometimes it needs
something darker.

1257
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,543
Don't you dare
give up on us now.

1258
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:08,128
The world needs you.

1259
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:16,029
Kent!

1260
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:26,998
No!

1261
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,940
Mom? What's happening?

1262
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:38,152
It's Sabbac.

1263
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:40,280
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1264
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:41,364
Whatever happens...

1265
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:44,575
you stay behind me.

1266
01:42:55,628 --> 01:42:56,754
♪ Baby, come back ♪

1267
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,467
Don't worry,
I die by electricity!

1268
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:06,055
You want some Kahndaq?
Come and get it!

1269
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:07,807
Come and get it!

1270
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,350
No, no. No.

1271
01:43:09,434 --> 01:43:11,519
-Don't send me home, I can help.
-I know.

1272
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,438
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1273
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:55,438
The Gods
have brought us together again.

1274
01:43:57,398 --> 01:44:00,068
It's not your time, Father.

1275
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:03,946
Hey!

1276
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:06,908
What are you all
standing around for?

1277
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,202
This is our chance.

1278
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,875
With these hands,
we built Kahndaq.

1279
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:18,044
And with these hands,
we will set it free!

1280
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,010
The people need a hero.

1281
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:32,058
No, father.
They need to be free.

1282
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:37,397
What are we waiting for?

1283
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:02,588
Say the word.

1284
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,091
Shazam.

1285
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,563
The people of Kahndaq
rise up against you!

1286
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,092
Yes!

1287
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,473
I got this.

1288
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:56,309
Go get him.

1289
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:15,786
You know what I have to do.

1290
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,123
Beat his ass!

1291
01:46:19,207 --> 01:46:21,417
Let the fate of Kahndaq
be decided

1292
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:24,295
by a true battle of champions.

1293
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:26,047
Let's end this.

1294
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:53,991
It's a lot of them.

1295
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:57,578
-It's a bit more than I thought.
-Yeah.

1296
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,789
Just a bit.

1297
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:08,089
Hey, Mom!

1298
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:18,933
These are our streets! Our city!

1299
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,853
-Free Kahndaq!

1300
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:33,114
The wizards' powers
were wasted on you.

1301
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:35,157
You are not a hero.

1302
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,288
No. I'm not.

1303
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,041
-But he is.

1304
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,680
You cannot stand against me.

1305
01:47:57,763 --> 01:47:59,974
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1306
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:12,111
I learned this trick
from an old friend.

1307
01:48:51,776 --> 01:48:53,110
You can control it!

1308
01:48:57,365 --> 01:48:58,699
You have to!

1309
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,504
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

1310
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:38,823
-Yes!

1311
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:04,598
I never thought I'd be happy
to see you.

1312
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,103
I'm only here because of him.

1313
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,191
That makes two of us.

1314
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,461
See you around, old friend.

1315
01:50:48,809 --> 01:50:50,269
Think you can keep him
out of trouble?

1316
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,271
As long as no one
comes looking for it.

1317
01:50:52,354 --> 01:50:53,397
Fair enough.

1318
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,234
Just be careful.

1319
01:50:57,318 --> 01:51:00,279
The kind of justice
you dish out can darken your soul.

1320
01:51:00,362 --> 01:51:02,782
It's his darkness
that lets him do

1321
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:05,493
what heroes like you cannot.

1322
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:08,996
I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

1323
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:20,007
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1324
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:20,925
Just saying.

1325
01:51:22,802 --> 01:51:23,886
We made a great team.

1326
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:32,186
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1327
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:33,521
Smasher, let's go.

1328
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:48,118
Long live The Champion!

1329
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:53,249
Long live The Champion!

1330
01:51:55,668 --> 01:51:56,836
You could lead them.

1331
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:31,954
How does it feel?

1332
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:34,999
Wrong.

1333
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:48,679
So, what now?

1334
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:51,056
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1335
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,017
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1336
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:56,562
And it still does.

1337
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:59,189
What it needs now
is a protector.

1338
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:01,025
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1339
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:04,111
Perhaps that name is a little...

1340
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:05,195
old-fashioned.

1341
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,573
So what should we call you?

1342
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,334
Okay, "Black Adam."

1343
01:56:06,502 --> 01:56:08,587
My name is Amanda Waller.

1344
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,340
Congratulations,
you have my attention.

1345
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:15,344
This is gonna be
your only warning.

1346
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:18,263
You don't want to stay
in my prison, that's fine.

1347
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:20,933
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1348
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:24,728
You step one foot outside of
it, you will not live to regret it.

1349
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:29,066
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1350
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:30,943
I can call in a favor
and send people

1351
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:32,736
who aren't from this planet.

1352
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:35,864
Send them all.

1353
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,076
As you wish.

1354
01:56:54,133 --> 01:56:57,553
It's been a while
since anyone's made the world this nervous.

1355
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:04,476
Black Adam.

1356
01:57:06,186 --> 01:57:07,187
We should talk.
