You're Jim Shepard's brother.

You're the new girl.

248

I know a lot
about your brother, but...

I don't know anything
about you.

You know what?
I've never met someone

Where you from?

You're not going
on a trip, are you?

One day.

Are you going
to the midnight dance?

262

I'm not invited.

Why not?

264
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,611
Well, after I win the Run,

I'll make sure
you get invited.

554
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,063

[Dillon]
You're not allowed

[Richie] What's the matter
with you?

608
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,179

[Bud] Could be... Could be
the whole thing's over.

616
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,949
Could be, right?

617
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,078
[Mitch] It ain't over.

618
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,247

He's just a normal kid

I mean, he played baseball
real good. Sure.

944

But even after some big game,

945

to hang out with me.

My dad, he lived here
long before I was born.

958
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,661
He never talked
about this place,

959

wanted to come back.

960

I was sent here.
