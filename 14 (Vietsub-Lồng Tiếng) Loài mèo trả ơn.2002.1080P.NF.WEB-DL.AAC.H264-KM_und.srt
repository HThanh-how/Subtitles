1
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,909
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF TROUBLED
BY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS

2
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,078
OR A PROBLEM YOU CAN'T SOLVE,

3
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,664
THERE'S SOMEWHERE YOU CAN GO,

4
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,791
A PLACE WHERE...

5
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,396
Oh no!

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,566
-Haru, are you up?
-I am now.

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
Morning.

8
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,001
I mean, really.
Why bother to set your alarm?

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,503
Bye.

10
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,254
No breakfast? It's so delicious.

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,802
Oh, so delicious.

12
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,387
You're awful!

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,931
Bye!

14
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,955
My shoe!

15
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,419
Excuse me... Oh, come on!

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,927
"The Kingdom is gone...

17
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,429
yet the mountains and rivers remain.

18
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,141
And the castle is draped...

19
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,018
in the vivid green of spring."

20
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,728
Miss Yoshioka.

21
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,022
Nice of you to join us. Sit down.

22
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,190
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,652
Caught again.

24
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,855
I hate this.

25
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,108
Humiliated in front of the whole class.

26
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,235
Machida was laughing too.

27
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,778
I noticed that.

28
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,324
Why? What's wrong with me?

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,786
It must be some kind of omen.

30
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,123
Something even worse is going to happen.

31
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,375
Usually someone would be encouraging.

32
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,926
HOMEMADE CAKES

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,552
What an unusual cat.

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,557
What's so great about Machida?

35
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,851
He's just so cool.

36
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,771
-Then tell him.
-He's taken.

37
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,273
Ah, the freshman. She's pretty hot.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,274
So you knew.

39
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,778
If he ignores you, I'll comfort you.

40
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,238
You're horrible!

41
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:03,243
-Tsuge is so cool.
-If he ignores you...

42
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,086
-He was carrying something.
-Stolen goods?

43
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,003
Who knows?

44
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,887
What's he doing?

45
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,849
Hey cat, watch out!

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,231
-Oh well.
-Hey, that's dangerous.

47
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,607
What?

48
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,865
What's he doing?

49
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,909
Haru, wait!

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,668
You've got it!

51
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,511
Hey! Stop that truck!

52
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,061
Are you okay, cat?

53
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:31,581
I'm grateful.
I think you just saved my life.

54
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,083
I hope you're all right.

55
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,214
I'm sorry, but I must hurry.

56
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,216
I will thank you properly another day.

57
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,177
Don't mention it.

58
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,015
Haru!

59
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,774
Oh, you broke it.

60
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,735
Well, a cat's life is more important.

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,361
Did you see that?

62
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,781
He bowed to me.

63
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,284
Haru, are you okay?

64
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,044
I'm home.

65
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,172
Watch your step.

66
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,510
I just can't decide which pattern to use.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,845
Honey, can you make dinner?

68
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,806
Mom?

69
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,642
Can cats talk?

70
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,479
Well, let's see...

71
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,819
What?

72
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
You reminded me of something.

73
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,199
When you were little...

74
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,577
you used to say you could talk to cats.

75
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,037
I did?

76
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,872
Yes, don't you remember?

77
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
What's wrong?

78
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,527
Oh, you're hungry.

79
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,112
Do you like fish?

80
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
Here, have some of these.

81
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,661
You need a bath.

82
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,204
Taste good?

83
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,792
Ah, I see.

84
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,670
Want some more?

85
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,798
Here, eat them all.

86
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,599
You don't have to thank me.

87
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,310
-Haru?
-Mom!

88
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,148
-What were you doing?
-Talking to a cat.

89
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,695
I asked you what the cat said.

90
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:13,242
You answered,
"It's tough to survive in this world."

91
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,662
You were so serious,
I couldn't help laughing.

92
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,462
I totally forgot about that.

93
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,342
Anyway, better not
miss breakfast tomorrow.

94
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,806
YOSHIOKA

95
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,836
YOSHIOKA
AOI CITY WAKABADAI 1-5

96
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,921
Um... please come out.

97
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,803
A bit closer.

98
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,687
Allow me to introduce...

99
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,315
the King of the Kingdom of Cats.

100
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,150
A king among kings.

101
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,736
The Cat King!

102
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,033
That's me.

103
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,121
The cat whose life you saved...

104
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,291
was Prince Lune, His Majesty's son.

105
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
For this important service
to the Kingdom...

106
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,297
His Majesty wishes
to express his gratitude.

107
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,515
Thanks a bunch.

108
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,270
Here's your program.

109
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,986
Starting tomorrow...

110
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,657
unlimited happiness will be yours.

111
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,536
Thanks.

112
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,039
See you.

113
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,576
What a dream.

114
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,206
So you mean...

115
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,916
it wasn't you?

116
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,795
You must be joking.

117
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,173
Then who did this?

118
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,931
Haru, get down here!

119
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,059
What on earth is this?

120
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,813
Cattails?

121
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm working too hard.
I better go back to bed.

122
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,039
STOP

123
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,415
No!

124
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,791
Why?

125
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,713
Haru, here's one
of the troublesome sticks!

126
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,507
Morning! Sorry, gotta run.

127
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,722
-What's she up to?
-Maybe she's got catnip.

128
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,641
Catnip? Why?

129
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,600
Who knows?

130
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,938
Hey Yoshioka, leave your cats at home.

131
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,106
They're not mine!

132
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,985
What is going on?

133
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,516
It wasn't a dream. They were serious.

134
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,644
Maybe I shouldn't have saved that cat.

135
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,407
-Haru.
-Wha... What now?

136
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,701
Did you lose your cat posse?

137
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,497
Oh, sure. No problem. The cats are gone.

138
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,249
That's good.

139
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,879
Listen, I really need your help.

140
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,966
Can you fill in for me? Tsuge has a match.

141
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,552
I'll miss it if I don't leave
right after class.

142
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,678
Please!

143
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,472
Sure, I guess.

144
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,725
Cleanup duty, right?

145
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,685
Haru, you're the best.

146
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,447
Go for it, Tsuge!

147
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,369
Tsuge wins! He's so cool.

148
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,065
-Watch the step.
-Thank you.

149
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,276
Ow, that hurt.

150
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,780
Oh no!

151
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
What a mess.

152
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
Hey, come back.

153
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,799
What's wrong with me, anyway?

154
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,426
There you are. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

155
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,481
You cats!
One thing after another all morning.

156
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,692
You must be pleased.

157
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,901
I'm not!

158
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,028
I don't understand.

159
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,992
The whole kingdom
just wants you to be happy.

160
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,996
You don't get it. I don't eat mice.

161
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,498
I don't like cattails or catnip.

162
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,251
How astonishing.

163
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,294
Please pardon our ignorance...

164
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,339
but this is quite unexpected.

165
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,175
How will I tell His Majesty?

166
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,845
I'm sorry if I upset you.

167
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,638
I've said too much.

168
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,102
Lots of stuff's been going on.

169
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,604
What kind of stuff?

170
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,816
Just stuff, that's all.

171
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,985
I see. That's too bad.

172
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,989
Even a beautiful lady
like yourself has problems.

173
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,659
Oh, come on.

174
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,288
No, I'm serious.
Your problems are our problems.

175
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,957
It's our duty to make you happy.

176
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,418
-There's more?
-Indeed.

177
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,548
We invite you to visit
the Kingdom of Cats.

178
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,300
The Kingdom of Cats?

179
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,011
It's heaven on earth.

180
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,972
Beautiful scenery and scrumptious food.

181
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,684
The whole kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

182
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,645
And there's more!

183
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,106
His Majesty is very eager...

184
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,610
to repay you for saving Prince Lune.

185
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,197
You and the prince shall be married!

186
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,286
No way. That's completely impossible.

187
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,288
I mean, he's a cat.

188
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,290
What's wrong with that?

189
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,794
He's not only a cat, he's cool!

190
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,963
He is?

191
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,810
Hmm...

192
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,813
It might be nice after all.

193
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,399
Just lying around all day...

194
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,609
Exactly!

195
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,194
It sounds perfect.

196
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,322
Gourmet food, then a nice nap.

197
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,033
Nobody bugging you.

198
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,702
But marrying a cat would be weird.

199
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,122
Even if he is a... huh?

200
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,376
Very good. We'll see you tonight.

201
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,046
What do you mean? Hey, wait!

202
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,092
Ouch...

203
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,011
That one really hurt.

204
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,430
I need to think.

205
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,267
I mean... the thing is...

206
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,311
What do I do? Those cats mean business.

207
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,147
They'll kidnap me for sure.

208
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
I'll be a cat's bride!

209
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,033
No, no, not that!

210
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,203
<i>Haru...Haru...</i>

211
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,497
Where are you?

212
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,417
<i>Go to the Cat Business Office.</i>

213
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,543
<i>They'll help you there.</i>

214
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,298
Who's that? Where are you?

215
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,049
What's the Cat Business Office?

216
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,010
<i>They're sure to help.</i>

217
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>A big white cat will show you the way.</i>

218
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
A big white cat?

219
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,395
<i>Go to the crossroad.</i>

220
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,189
<i>He'll be waiting for you.</i>

221
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,709
What's a cat business office anyway?

222
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,633
How do I find some big white cat?

223
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,179
But the voice was beautiful.
Maybe the cat is too.

224
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,100
All this walking around is getting to me.

225
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,145
Time for a break.

226
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,774
Wait, what's going on?

227
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,444
Such a fat cat!

228
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,738
What are you doing there?

229
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,242
A big white cat. Is this the one?

230
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,412
I'm looking for the Cat Business Office.

231
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,168
I need some help.

232
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,970
Guess I got the wrong guy...
or the wrong cat.

233
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,638
Sorry I sat on you.

234
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,184
-Follow me.
-You!

235
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,814
Hey wait up, would you?

236
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,092
Can't we just walk on the street?

237
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,303
You're just mad at me.

238
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,388
Because I called you fat?

239
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,375
Huh?

240
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,389
What a strange place.

241
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,084
So, where's the Cat Business Office?

242
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,672
Hello?

243
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,423
I've got a problem.

244
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,468
I'll be taken to the Cat Kingdom.

245
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,570
What kind of place is this?

246
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,634
Hey Baron! Got a visitor.

247
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,803
Cut the theatrics and get out here.

248
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,165
Welcome to the Cat Business Office.

249
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,961
Cool...

250
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,925
Our world overlaps
with yours, but it's different.

251
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,344
Sometimes, when people create something...

252
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,222
and they put their heart into it...

253
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,975
their creation comes alive,
with its own soul.

254
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
Like me. Like him.

255
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,741
Oh my gosh!

256
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,369
This is Toto, our resident gargoyle.

257
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,081
Baron, you rarely have visitors.

258
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
She's rather charming, isn't she?

259
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,210
"Baron"?

260
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,922
I'm Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

261
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,967
My maker named me.

262
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,843
So you're Baron.

263
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,971
I heard about you.

264
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,848
Trouble with cats? From the Cat Kingdom?

265
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,017
That's right.

266
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,645
I saved a cat from getting run over.

267
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,564
Now they want me to visit their kingdom.

268
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,442
To pay you back? It figures.

269
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,486
A goody two-shoes.

270
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,617
You shouldn't have bothered.

271
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,953
You're as cynical as ever, Muta.

272
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,581
Don't you understand? She saved his life.

273
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,210
And look what she gets.

274
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,296
Never mess with other people's business.

275
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,717
Where did you meet?

276
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,470
At the crossroad.
She knew about the office.

277
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,434
I heard a voice.

278
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,185
I didn't recognize it.

279
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,564
-A voice?
-And you did what it said?

280
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,316
That's the dumbest... Ouch!

281
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,320
-Watch it!
-Why don't you hold your tongue?

282
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,113
Butt out!

283
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,033
Please, don't fight because of me.

284
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,326
Ouch!

285
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,535
And your name is?

286
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,413
Oh, it's Haru. My name is Haru.

287
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,832
Okay, Haru. Please come in.

288
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,169
Don't worry about them.

289
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,338
You lousy blackbird!

290
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,965
I'm a crow, you stupid cat!

291
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,177
Where are you? It's too dark.

292
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,722
You're so fat you glow in the dark.

293
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:26,186
-Go get fried, chicken wings.
-Moo shu pork!

294
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
Pardon me.

295
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,032
Wow, this place is gorgeous.

296
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,993
-Come in and have a seat.
-Thanks.

297
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,747
Tea, with lemon or milk?

298
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,831
Milk, please.

299
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,093
I love this style.

300
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,929
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

301
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,141
Cute.

302
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,769
My special blend.

303
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,189
I can't guarantee the flavor.
It's different every time.

304
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,820
This is good. This is really good.

305
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,321
You're lucky.

306
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,574
How can you drink that bitter stuff?

307
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,870
Too refined for you, I bet.

308
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,705
Go catch a worm, bird.

309
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,378
Muta, tell me
about the Kingdom of Cats again.

310
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,922
The whole place is fake.

311
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,092
It's for cats who don't know
where they belong.

312
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,760
Where they belong?

313
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,513
One cat told me...

314
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,891
their king wants me to marry his son.

315
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,561
Why don't you do it?

316
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,562
No way.

317
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,272
Might not be bad.

318
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,898
That's absurd!

319
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,775
Could be interesting.

320
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,193
I see.

321
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,199
I've always wanted to visit
the Kingdom of Cats.

322
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,826
Maybe it's time.

323
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,079
You've got guts. I'll give it a miss.

324
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,914
You're coming too.

325
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,917
Sorry, that place gives me the creeps.

326
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,920
You're not taking her, are you?

327
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,214
That wouldn't be wise.

328
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,092
But, we can't leave her here.

329
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,556
Don't look at me.
Do I look like a babysitter?

330
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,683
-Are you busy?
-Not exactly.

331
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,060
I'd better go home.

332
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm just making trouble for everyone.

333
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,153
I got into this mess.

334
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,449
I have to get myself out.

335
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,701
I see.

336
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,038
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.

337
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,959
Fine, I'll do it.

338
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,254
I'll hang out with her.

339
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,839
Excellent, Muta.

340
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
Then it's settled.

341
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,676
Haru, take a seat.

342
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,844
But...

343
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,806
Muta's always complaining.

344
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,974
But he's a good guy.

345
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,937
I get it.

346
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,481
He's just a pussy cat.

347
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,607
That's right.

348
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,026
Oh, stop it.

349
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,404
Thanks for your help, Moo-ta.

350
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,826
Moo-ta? Did you just call me a fat cow?

351
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,619
No, but you are fat... oops!

352
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,412
I'm starting to like this girl.

353
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,206
I changed my mind.

354
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,544
Didn't we have some delicious chiffon cake
in the cupboard?

355
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,878
Where?

356
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,588
Top shelf right.

357
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,216
Why didn't you say so?

358
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,385
Let's have a little party.

359
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,472
Then you'll need my special mulberries.

360
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,687
This is getting interesting.

361
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,605
Can I help out?

362
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,483
Haru, there's something more important.

363
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,154
You've got to discover
where you truly belong.

364
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,950
Then you'll have nothing to worry about.

365
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,997
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

366
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,665
You're going all out.

367
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,125
Naturally.

368
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,047
It feels like something wonderful
is going to happen.

369
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,384
Yes? Maybe that's Toto.

370
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,017
Miss Haru, we've come for you.

371
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,852
No!

372
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,563
What are you doing?

373
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,940
Hey!

374
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,694
Not good.

375
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,614
Calm down!

376
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,575
You promised to help me!

377
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,537
A horde of cats is headed this way.

378
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,248
-Now you tell us?
-After them!

379
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,006
Ouch...

380
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,343
-We looked everywhere for you.
-I'm going home!

381
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,013
Careful!

382
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,016
Let me go. Take me back this instant!

383
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,937
Don't worry, every bride gets nervous.

384
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,521
I'm not nervous!

385
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,153
This is completely insane.

386
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,322
Go away!

387
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,950
Ouch! Hey, let go!

388
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,327
Muta and Baron!

389
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,329
Let go, I'm telling you!

390
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,580
Toto, now!

391
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,041
Don't let go!

392
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,005
-Why did you do that?
-We had to.

393
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,591
Why, you...

394
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,842
C'mon!

395
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,470
He's too heavy!

396
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,433
-Toto...
-I'm there!

397
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,996
Where are you going?

398
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,792
Hey!

399
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,044
We're losing them.

400
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,882
-Climb!
-Hold tight.

401
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,602
Now what?

402
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,360
They're riding the wind.

403
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,361
I'm on it!

404
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,083
Ouch...

405
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
I landed on my back.

406
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,379
What's going on?

407
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,006
Where am I?

408
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,476
Muta? You got bigger.

409
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,395
No, you got smaller.

410
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,357
Why?

411
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,110
Because we're here.

412
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,207
In the Kingdom of Cats?

413
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,559
This is it.

414
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,877
Wow, there are cats everywhere.

415
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,172
It's their kingdom, you know.

416
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,340
Hey!

417
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,144
It's so nice and relaxing.

418
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,021
C'mon, let's blow this catnip stand.

419
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,190
-Not yet.
-Listen, you...

420
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,985
I mean, it feels so nice.

421
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,529
No! You must leave at once.

422
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,868
Please run away from here.

423
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,538
What a beautiful cat.

424
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,623
Even the cats are prettier here.

425
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,126
Please, there's no time to lose!

426
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,295
This is not where you belong, Haru.

427
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,590
How do you know my name?

428
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,301
Miss Haru!

429
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,845
It's that cat again.

430
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,223
I'm so relieved to find you.

431
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,312
We dropped you on the way in.

432
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,064
Your servant was over the weight limit.

433
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,567
Servant!

434
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,028
No, this is Muta.

435
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,783
Shall we go? The banquet is ready.
Please join us, Moo-ta.

436
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,785
Moo-ta?

437
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,454
But I...

438
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,998
His Majesty is waiting.

439
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,001
-Where?
-In the palace. See?

440
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,379
-Oh, right.
-Yes indeed.

441
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,675
You're not going, are you?

442
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,554
I should at least greet the king.

443
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,932
Are you crazy? Let's go!

444
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,767
-This way.
-Just a minute.

445
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,936
Can she come with us?

446
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,606
Your name?

447
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,816
Yuki, sir. I serve at the royal table.

448
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,861
So, you work at the palace?

449
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,447
Miss Haru, she'll be at the banquet.

450
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,908
Okay, see you soon.

451
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,577
Hey!

452
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,168
Haru...

453
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,571
What are those? They look creepy.

454
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,498
She's finally here...
My future daughter-in-law.

455
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,799
I must welcome her in person!

456
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,266
Where have I seen that cat before?

457
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,780
You'll need to change
before you meet the King.

458
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,324
New clothes?

459
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,368
-Please wait outside.
-Why should I?

460
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,871
-Beat it!
-What's your problem?

461
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,957
We've prepared some refreshments.

462
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,125
I'll wait.

463
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,927
I think I like this.

464
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,599
The dress highlights your beauty.

465
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,477
Prince Lune is adored by all the ladies.

466
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,313
We know you'll be very happy.

467
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,272
Really?

468
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,776
No, I mean, that's not why I'm here.

469
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,987
A picture of perfection.

470
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,700
You're the purr-fect bride
for the crown prince.

471
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,098
Natoru, who is that cat?

472
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,141
I believe his name is Moo-ta.

473
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,393
Moo-ta?

474
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,646
What a bizarre name.

475
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,984
That was just an appetizer.

476
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,118
Listen, I'm really sorry...

477
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,620
but I'm not ready to get married.

478
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,624
But I thought you already said yes.

479
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,335
That's what I heard too.

480
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,754
Where's the Prince?

481
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,133
He's touring the provinces.

482
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,971
It's just... well,
I don't really know him.

483
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,140
And anyway, he's a cat, right?

484
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,059
And of course, I'm not a cat...

485
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,483
I wouldn't worry about that.

486
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,318
Take a look!

487
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,870
Here you are.

488
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,001
Wow, real cat ears.

489
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,799
I'm a cat?

490
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,428
Muta, where are you?

491
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,601
What happened to him?

492
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,688
He wanted catnip jelly
enough to swim in it.

493
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,482
And as you see...

494
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,444
Did he have to die like this?

495
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,364
Muta, how could you do this?

496
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,034
The banquet, Miss Haru.

497
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,994
I can't leave him.

498
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,371
Then we'll bring him along.

499
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,552
Is that Miss Haru?

500
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,554
Such perfect ears.

501
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,515
Such soft, attractive paws!

502
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,688
I was told you don't care for mice...

503
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,108
so I brought you a whole fresh fish.

504
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,654
The bride doesn't seem pleased.

505
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,572
What's our entertainment?

506
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,949
The usual.

507
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,480
Not funny enough!

508
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:57,825
Oh, my...

509
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,142
Next!

510
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,006
Is that the best you can do?

511
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,195
Allow me to amuse Miss Haru.

512
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,531
Sire?

513
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,950
Well, why not?

514
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,125
Would you care to dance?

515
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:36,674
I'm an awful dancer.
Oh no, I even talk like a cat!

516
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,760
Trust me.

517
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,932
They seem quite well-matched.

518
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,572
<i>What is this?</i>

519
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,075
<i>I never felt like this before.</i>

520
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,870
<i>Being a cat might not be so bad.</i>

521
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:54,293
No, Haru. This world is not for you.

522
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,422
It's not where you belong.

523
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,639
Don't you remember what I said?

524
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,267
Wait, you're...

525
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,899
Stop the music!

526
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,702
I smell a rat.

527
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,163
Just who are you?

528
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,708
Allow me to introduce myself.

529
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,839
I'm certainly no rat.

530
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,140
I am Humbert von Gikkingen.

531
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,558
I've come for Haru!

532
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,684
Baron!

533
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,561
Does he really...

534
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,063
Mean it?

535
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,440
He'd better not! Seize him!

536
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,540
I'm stuffed.

537
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,542
He's alive!

538
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,710
Muta, you're okay!

539
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,505
Uh-oh.

540
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,675
Stop, you scoundrels!

541
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,802
Take His Majesty to safety.

542
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,346
Don't let them escape!

543
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,977
This way to the emergency exits.
Please proceed quietly.

544
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,318
Incoming!

545
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,070
Muta, you're great!

546
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,906
Every cat for himself.

547
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,867
This way.

548
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,997
I saw you before.

549
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,750
Baron, I knew you would come.

550
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,127
Do you know me?

551
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,879
I've heard about you and your Office.

552
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,509
If only I'd listened to you,
this wouldn't have happened.

553
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,930
If you leave before dawn,
you'll become human again.

554
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,056
Really?

555
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,726
This leads outside the castle.

556
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,643
Very convenient.

557
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,478
What about Muta?

558
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,490
He'll be all right. Let's hurry.

559
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,547
-A back door.
-The tower leads to your world.

560
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,050
It's so tall...

561
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,137
You must find your way
through the maze first.

562
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,222
We'll make it.

563
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,684
Good. Please take care of Haru.

564
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
Wait!

565
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,649
She's gone. I didn't get to thank her.

566
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,485
Haru, this is just a guess...

567
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,072
but I think she led you to me.

568
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,409
<i>Haru, the Cat Business Office...</i>

569
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,246
You're right.
That beautiful voice was hers.

570
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,581
But why help me?

571
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,430
Thanks to you everyone's out to get me.

572
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,516
Let's just hurry.

573
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,853
Hey, I was talking.

574
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,652
Are they in?

575
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,612
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,947
Purr-fect.

577
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,950
They'll never find the way.

578
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,952
We have ringside seats.

579
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,833
This is complicated.

580
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,586
-At least the sun's still high.
-It's always high.

581
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,046
Really?

582
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,216
It's probably past midnight back home.

583
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,051
Then we better hurry!

584
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,595
So, uhm... let's see...

585
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,431
Where do we go?

586
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,435
They're completely lost.

587
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,939
No one escapes from the labyrinth.
Right, Your Majesty?

588
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,192
Yup, no hope for them now.

589
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,695
-And the guards?
-Here they come.

590
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,241
This way.

591
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,577
We'll just have to try every route.

592
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,205
Aim for the tower. That's our goal.

593
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,665
Makes sense.

594
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,709
Muta, that's cheating.

595
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,712
No point in playing their game.

596
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,214
There he is.

597
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,717
Go chase somebody else!

598
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,639
Let's hurry while he keeps them busy.

599
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,601
What am I, bait?

600
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,283
Get back, Haru!

601
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,425
Nice work!

602
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,761
Is it bent?

603
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,806
I needed a new one anyway.

604
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,974
Unbelievable.

605
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,483
Nice shot!

606
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,157
That's one of ours!

607
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,494
Sire, how could you?

608
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,454
We won't count that one.

609
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,165
Natori, look.

610
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,501
The guards have scattered.

611
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,837
They're all lost.

612
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:12,879
What about Haru?

613
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh! They're getting close.

614
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,886
Hey!

615
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,012
Welcome back.

616
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,223
-Any luck?
-Dead end.

617
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,784
They're falling for it.

618
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,705
Another dead end.

619
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,415
It's getting harder.

620
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,334
Uhm...

621
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,838
Wait, there wasn't a wall here before.

622
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,631
Must be your imagination.

623
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,134
No, I'm sure we went through here.

624
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,511
You mean the walls have legs?

625
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,852
This is no wall. It's fake!

626
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,489
See?

627
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,908
Good work Haru!

628
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,242
You gotta be kidding.

629
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,911
What?

630
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,998
How often have I told them
not to line up like that?

631
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,253
They're getting away!

632
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,172
Your Majesty, wait!

633
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,807
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

634
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,439
Show-off.

635
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,651
-Baron, it's okay.
-Don't worry!

636
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,422
Your Majesty, please. It's dangerous.

637
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,840
They won't escape!

638
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,178
I stationed soldiers
in the tower, just in case.

639
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,891
Brilliant!

640
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,275
That's the spirit. Get them!

641
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,581
Shoddy construction, I'm afraid.

642
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,875
This is outrageous!

643
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,671
We have no choice.
Give me the secret weapon.

644
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,965
What? No, not that!

645
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,010
Your Majesty, think of your image!

646
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,302
Detonator!

647
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,430
The cable simply won't reach.

648
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,848
Try the wireless unit.

649
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,187
Finally! The top floor.

650
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,564
Almost there.

651
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,110
Now!

652
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,367
-What's happening?
-Hold on!

653
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,386
That was quite spectacular.

654
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,388
Let's go!

655
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,145
We're back on the ground.

656
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,898
Now we wait.

657
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,524
We're trapped.

658
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,071
Follow me, men!

659
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,368
Gikkingen! Splendid to see you again.

660
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,997
Haru, I'll have you back
in the castle in a jiffy.

661
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,042
A cat's life isn't so bad.

662
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,711
Do I have to learn to like mice?

663
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,839
Hold on, it's too early to give up.

664
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,817
What in heaven's name happened here?

665
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,819
Father!

666
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,740
Lune, you're back already?

667
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,243
Stand at attention for the crown prince!

668
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,869
The prince?

669
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,753
Yuki sent word for me to return.

670
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,213
What's going on here?

671
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,258
Haru.

672
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,385
Yuki, it's you.

673
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,220
Good, we're not too late.

674
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,681
I was just, err, welcoming her.

675
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,768
And I thought you'd be happy...

676
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,770
to have a girl like Haru for your bride.

677
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,481
You needn't have worried.

678
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,650
I'm going to marry Yuki.

679
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,779
You're joking.

680
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,158
-Surprise, surprise.
-The prince has style.

681
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,789
Yuki, it's for you.

682
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,459
I brought it from your hometown.

683
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,384
My goodness, it's been so long.

684
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,305
I used to love those cookies too.

685
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,222
I know.

686
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,685
You gave them to me
when I was homeless and hungry.

687
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,897
That kitten, that was you!

688
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,525
You're so beautiful,
I didn't recognize you.

689
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:08,902
Yuki...

690
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,405
Will you accept these as a symbol...

691
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,199
of our life together?

692
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,495
Which means...

693
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,372
you two are getting married?

694
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,461
That's great! I'm so happy for you, Yuki.

695
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,629
Thank you, Haru!

696
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,132
If you hadn't found me...

697
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,718
I might not have survived.

698
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,846
And you saved me from that truck.

699
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,725
I never dreamed
you were the person Yuki talks about.

700
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,061
You saved both our lives.

701
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,896
How can we thank you?

702
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,940
You don't have to.

703
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,025
You've made me happy already.

704
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,070
I'm so glad I helped you both.

705
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,701
This is very moving.

706
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,913
So, you already had a fiancee.

707
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,707
Oh well, it can't be helped.

708
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,877
But poor Haru, you must be heartbroken.

709
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,295
Not me.

710
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,881
Now, now. If you can't marry Lune...

711
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,841
why not marry me?

712
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,970
Just imagine.

713
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:21,516
You'll have all the cookies
and fish you can eat. Well?

714
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,978
Just put me back the way I was.

715
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,689
Of course... if you say yes.

716
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,568
Are you out of your mind?

717
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,198
Of course I don't want to marry you...

718
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,700
you crazy cat!

719
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,121
I don't understand.

720
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,626
This is great. The girl has spirit!

721
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,588
Marry you? Never!

722
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,257
I like a woman who speaks her mind.

723
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,136
I'll let you in on something.

724
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,847
I'm Renaldo Moon!

725
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,140
Renaldo?

726
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,391
Renaldo Moon?

727
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,268
<i>The</i> Renaldo Moon?

728
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,978
Now I remember!

729
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,272
-What?
-Have you forgotten, Sire?

730
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,026
The most notorious crime
in the Kingdom's history!

731
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,153
A huge cat appeared suddenly...

732
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,947
devoured all the fish
in the lake, and escaped.

733
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:21,159
That was Renaldo Moon,
criminal of the century!

734
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,578
-Unbelievable.
-He's a monster!

735
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,789
Muta, that's disgraceful, even for you.

736
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,959
Maybe I'll gobble up the castle this time!

737
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,630
Quick, get His Majesty to safety!

738
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,176
No!

739
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,180
-Protect Haru!
-Yes sir.

740
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,015
Forward!

741
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,104
-How dare you!
-Your Majesty!

742
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,191
I'll handle my father.

743
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,193
You'd better go now.

744
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,986
But the tower has fallen.

745
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,280
It's still connected to the other side.

746
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,038
Strange...

747
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,539
Oh no! It's already dawn.

748
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,334
-Leave it to me.
-What are you doing?

749
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,836
Don't throw me!

750
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,466
Run! We're right behind you.

751
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,717
Take care!

752
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,184
<i>Thanks, Yuki.</i>

753
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,312
<i>I guess I did right after all.</i>

754
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:35,233
<i>Saving the two of you...</i>
<i>Feeling lost and down...</i>

755
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,778
<i>That was all part of discovering</i>
<i>where I belong.</i>

756
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,284
-I'll cover you.
-Thanks.

757
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,495
Where is Father?

758
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:48,788
Up there.

759
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,208
Father, it's dangerous. Please come down.

760
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,252
He's out of his mind.

761
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,795
I'll bring him back.

762
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,979
We'll settle this with a duel!

763
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,732
-With pleasure.
-Baron?

764
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,692
-Take care of Haru.
-Right.

765
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,325
I win, Cat King.

766
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,577
Fiddlesticks!

767
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,091
I heard about the cat
in top hat and tails...

768
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,344
but never dreamed you were this good.

769
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,556
I heard you spend your days
in some shop window.

770
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,561
You should have come
to my kingdom and joined me.

771
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,317
I'm quite happy with life just as it is.

772
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:48,366
Where in the world am I?

773
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,868
What have you done?

774
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,248
I didn't do a thing.

775
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,960
Now that the tower has collapsed...

776
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,338
who knows where the exit leads?

777
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,798
I must go!

778
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,847
Miss Haru...

779
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,557
I should've foreseen this.

780
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,393
But look, she's human again!

781
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,111
Oh no...

782
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,030
I think I'm going to fall.

783
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,159
I can't keep my balance!

784
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,078
Haru!

785
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,381
Muta, please don't say I'm heavy.

786
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,594
Okay... but before we do this again...

787
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:53,389
lose a little weight, will you?

788
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,569
I can't hold on!

789
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,824
Haru!

790
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,789
We're going to die!

791
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,043
-We're not dead yet! Look down!
-What?

792
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,879
Don't be afraid, just look down!

793
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,632
I can't!

794
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,967
Trust me!

795
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,980
Are we still alive?

796
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,149
-Yes!
-Probably...

797
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,829
It just hit me.

798
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,123
I think we look pretty cool!

799
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,178
What's this?

800
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,349
-A whole flock.
-And just in time.

801
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:30,361
Hey, Muta! How do you like
being saved by birds?

802
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,362
Toto!

803
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,364
It's that lousy black bird.

804
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,116
Thanks, Toto.

805
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,661
Good thing
my friends were waiting up here.

806
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,122
Doesn't it hurt to be walked on?

807
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,708
You're light as a feather, Haru.

808
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,043
-Really?
-I disagree.

809
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,461
Look, Haru.

810
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,423
It's my school.

811
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,676
I'm home. I made it back!

812
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,262
Thank you so much, everybody!

813
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,770
-They made it!
-Hooray for Miss Haru!

814
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,147
Wonderful.

815
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,899
Take care, Haru.

816
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,819
Your Majesty!

817
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:22,038
Natori, I think it's time
for me to retire.

818
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,915
Then I shall join you, Sire.

819
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,427
Toto, thank you.

820
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:41,599
My heart is still pounding.

821
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,683
That's not surprising.

822
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,019
But it was fun, too.

823
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,437
Yeah, right.

824
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,274
Well, Haru has a school day ahead of her.

825
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,778
She'd better get some rest.

826
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,237
That's right.

827
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,823
Is this going to be goodbye?

828
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,117
One more load to carry.

829
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,593
Baron, I think I have a crush on you.

830
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:22,139
I like your honesty, Haru.

831
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:30,106
You'll find your way
to the Cat Business Office...

832
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:34,026
if you ever really need us again.

833
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,030
Until then, goodbye!

834
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,912
Goodbye...

835
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,756
Thank you!

836
01:08:55,965 --> 01:09:00,052
Baron! Toto! You too, Muta!

837
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,015
What do you mean, "you too"?

838
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,352
Thanks a lot!

839
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,803
Oh no, better get up.

840
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,229
Morning.

841
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,982
Why are you up so early?

842
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,359
It's Sunday.

843
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,321
I'm going to the early show with Hiromi.

844
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:02,865
I'm off.

845
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,619
There's fried eggs and salad.

846
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,787
I already ate.

847
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,623
There's tea in the pot.

848
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,043
About the tea...

849
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,046
It's my special blend.

850
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:21,217
I can't guarantee the flavor.
It's different every time.

851
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,678
Is that so?

852
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,726
Oh, it smells nice.

853
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,899
Haru! I've got news
from a reliable source.

854
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,609
What's the big deal?

855
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,320
Machida broke up!

856
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,285
Oh, is that so.

857
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,454
What kind of reaction is that?

858
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,580
What?

859
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,666
Don't you have anything to say?

860
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:54,875
No.

861
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,086
It doesn't matter anymore.

862
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,266
Haru, did something happen?

863
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,976
-No.
-Come on!

864
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,560
No, honestly.

865
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,480
How about you?

866
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,439
What?

867
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:21,485
-How's it going with Tsuge?
-Well, it's not, actually.
