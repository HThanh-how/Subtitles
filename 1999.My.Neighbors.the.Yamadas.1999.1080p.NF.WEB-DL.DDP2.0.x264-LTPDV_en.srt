1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>This is the sun, this is the moon.</i>

2
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>This mountain is really the earth.</i>

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>And this is grandma.</i>

4
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,891
My, how splendid.

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,977
Hello, Mrs. Yamada.

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,315
I've never seen such a magnificent...

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,401
Yup, they're my little babies.

8
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,986
What species?

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,906
This is a Mino Chrysanthemum,
this is...

10
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,116
No, I mean the caterpillar.

11
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,538
No idea.

12
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:25,251
Grow into a butterfly
just as gaudy as that flower.

13
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,715
Mother!

14
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,177
<i>That's our grandma.</i>

15
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,149
<i>And my mother and me, Nonoko.</i>

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,278
What am I going to make
for dinner tonight?

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,327
I know, I'll go for it!
Something really special!

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,703
What are we having?

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,623
We had curry last week,
curry two days ago,

20
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,000
tonight... curry!

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,168
What?

22
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,058
<i>And this is my father</i>
<i>and my older brother.</i>

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,645
What's the use
of all this studying, Dad?

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,148
Listen, Noboru,

25
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,111
studying is not about
what's useful or not.

26
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,823
The studying that seems useless
may turn out to be useful.

27
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,200
On the other hand, it might be that.

28
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,079
studying that doesn't seem
not useful may not be,

29
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,875
but then, studying that seems useless
may then be useful.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,837
But when you really need it,
it's not about useful or useless.

31
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,173
What are you going on about?

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,512
So I still have to study.

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,461
I get it.

34
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,174
If my father had been smart
and really cool

35
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:40,053
and my mother had been gorgeous
and a great cook

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,226
and our family had been rich,
my whole life would've been different.

37
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,440
If only one of them...

38
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,776
Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,364
If we hadn't married,
there'd be no you and no Nonoko.

40
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,408
Without the two of us,
you wouldn't be here.

41
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,911
No, that's wrong.

42
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,582
If I had cooler parents,
I'd just be their kid instead.

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,084
How stupid.

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,963
Don't you know about
stamens and pistils?

45
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,089
You tell him.

46
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,924
You can't choose your parents.

47
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,553
No, I can't accept that.
Something's not right.

48
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,766
Because I'm me, Dad's Dad
and Mom's Mom.

49
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,978
What is that supposed to mean?

50
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,147
Who am I?

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,192
Where did I come from?

52
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,736
Where am I?

53
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,239
Who am I?

54
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,450
I get it.

55
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,372
So, there was a time
when Dad and Mom weren't married.

56
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>Takashi and Matsuko are off</i>
<i>to a great start in their new life.</i>

57
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,029
<i>Let's give them a warm send-off.</i>

58
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,076
<i>Congratulations, Takashi and Matsuko.</i>

59
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>I also offer warm wishes</i>
<i>to their parents and relatives.</i>

60
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,343
<i>Now, your prospects are boundless,</i>

61
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:49,390
<i>and you're embarking for the wide</i>
<i>open world under billowing sails.</i>

62
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,491
<i>Life, as they say, has its ups and downs.</i>

63
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>At times, the waves may taunt you,</i>
<i>tossing you in their swells.</i>

64
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,540
<i>But take heart.</i>

65
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,795
<i>It's hard to stick with it</i>
<i>and make it on your own,</i>

66
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,967
<i>but even a couple of losers can survive</i>
<i>most things if they're together.</i>

67
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:34,102
<i>So listen, take my advice,</i>
<i>and have children as soon as you can.</i>

68
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:40,775
<i>Children are the best reason</i>
<i>for riding out life's storms.</i>

69
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:55,308
<i>Nowadays people say child-rearing</i>
<i>is challenging and difficult,</i>

70
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,102
<i>but we've done it from time immemorial.</i>

71
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,397
<i>Children grow even without parents.</i>

72
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,109
<i>So hold them close to your heart</i>
<i>as they crawl, then walk.</i>

73
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,404
<i>They'll be fine.</i>

74
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,460
<i>Children make you</i>
<i>appreciate your own parents.</i>

75
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,339
<i>Parents may seem to do nothing</i>
<i>but order you around,</i>

76
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,676
<i>but they'll baby-sit your kids</i>
<i>and sometimes give them toys.</i>

77
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,554
<i>Nowadays young people</i>

78
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,976
<i>turn that saying about appreciating</i>
<i>parents to their own advantage.</i>

79
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,688
<i>But I guess that's part of it too.</i>

80
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:48,611
<i>If things work out,</i>
<i>you even get the real estate.</i>

81
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,158
<i>So, Matsuko and Takashi,</i>

82
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>start looking after your folks!</i>

83
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,915
I hope you know the land is in my name.

84
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,418
Excuse me, Mother, but I built this house.

85
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,921
Without land, there's no house.

86
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,049
And we are grateful to you,

87
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,552
but I've worked hard, too.

88
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,304
Your room gets the best light.

89
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,889
Thanks for nothing.

90
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:21,310
Of course, it does. It's on my land.

91
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,523
Besides, why do you always insist
you built it by yourself?

92
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,985
I hate to contradict you,
but I definitely built...

93
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,237
That's enough!

94
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,613
Both of you.

95
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,617
That's right! What's the point
of all this bickering?

96
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,119
Listen to Noboru.

97
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,246
In the end, it'll all be mine.

98
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,775
<i>And what should you fear most</i>
<i>on this lifelong voyage?</i>

99
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,486
<i>Wild storms and rip tides?</i>

100
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:25,041
<i>No. Beware the calm waters</i>
<i>when there's hardly a ripple in sight.</i>

101
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>As long as a family holds</i>
<i>each other tight, they can somehow</i>

102
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,381
<i>weather the wildest seas.</i>

103
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,634
<i>But calm waters are another story.</i>

104
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,888
<i>The wind dies down,</i>
<i>you sigh and relax,</i>

105
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,223
<i>loosening your hold.</i>

106
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,477
<i>But take care, Matsuko and Takashi!</i>

107
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,398
<i>If you selfishly please only yourselves,</i>

108
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,318
<i>you may lose each other.</i>

109
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,910
<i>You'll never see the sharks</i>
<i>gathering around you.</i>

110
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,418
<i>And how will you guide your ship?</i>

111
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,173
Without a wind or even a course?

112
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,510
If you row blindly, right, no, left...

113
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:22,556
<i>No, right after all, you'll never agree.</i>

114
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,602
<i>You may even wonder why</i>
<i>you're stuck on the same boat at all.</i>

115
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,648
<i>Your family's about to fall apart.</i>

116
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,733
Turn right there!

117
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,776
Are you sure?

118
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,985
Turn left!

119
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,196
Right, right! No, left, left!

120
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,364
Which way?

121
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,949
Oh dear, maybe right.

122
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,575
Which is it?

123
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,294
We came so close.

124
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,671
Our turn!

125
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,673
A FAMILY CRISIS

126
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,391
We're taking the long way around.

127
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,017
You should've turned!

128
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,519
No, no, go straight!

129
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,896
No, it's that way. Are you crazy?

130
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,440
It's this way, Dad!

131
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,025
Quiet! All of you.

132
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,446
Nonoko's the only one who's quiet.

133
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,574
Wait a minute... She's not here.

134
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,827
What?

135
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,745
Where is she?

136
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,581
Stop the car.

137
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,588
Where did we lose her?

138
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,091
Noboru, weren't you with her?

139
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeah, while Dad and I
were waiting for you.

140
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,015
Maybe she got bored and wandered off.

141
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,392
No, I remember her on the bench.

142
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,692
I'm so sorry.

143
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,696
What took you so long?

144
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,574
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

145
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,951
I could have done some shopping, too.

146
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,913
I wanted to look at baseball bats.

147
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,504
<i>I'm sure she's still there.</i>

148
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,264
It's all because you kept yelling about
how late we were.

149
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,601
Don't blame me.
You're the ones who were late.

150
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:36,106
You all got so excited,
you just left poor Nonoko behind.

151
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,485
Like you weren't there yourself, Grandma.

152
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,738
We were looking for
your flannel underwear!

153
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,824
The store will close. I'll never make it.

154
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,327
Stop thinking about yourself.

155
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,497
What if something terrible
happens to Nonoko?

156
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,582
Something terrible?

157
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,835
You don't mean... kidnapped?

158
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,840
She's so adorable, just like me.

159
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,136
This is no time for jokes!

160
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,599
I hope she doesn't forget.

161
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,976
Forget what?

162
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,602
The PTA mantra.

163
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,982
"Don't talk to strangers."

164
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,318
That's what you teach children?

165
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,864
It's like saying
all strangers are thieves.

166
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,366
Nonoko's fine. Those teeth!

167
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,412
Hey, cake! Gimme some!

168
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,664
Just one bite.

169
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,623
OK!

170
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,294
One chomp of those teeth!

171
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,503
Enough!

172
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,636
Please, our daughter
is about to be kidnapped!

173
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,058
We can't even call.

174
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,769
We should've called before.

175
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,479
I told you to buy a cellphone.

176
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,315
You keep quiet!

177
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,153
Oh, Nonoko!

178
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,222
Are you lost?

179
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,061
Huh? So, you're waiting for someone?

180
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,695
Who are you waiting for?

181
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,240
Can't you talk?

182
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,410
Then why don't you say anything?

183
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:59,041
I'm... I'm not supposed to talk to...

184
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:05,089
I know, "Don't talk to strangers," right?

185
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:12,638
You're very grown-up because
you're careful. You can talk now.

186
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,057
You should hear my story.

187
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:20,229
My father and mother
and grandma and brother all got lost.

188
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,356
Did you lose someone?

189
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,359
My mommy.

190
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,986
Your mommy?

191
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,240
My mommy went away.

192
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,744
I know. There've been
a lot of missing parents lately.

193
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,623
But it's only your mom, you'll find her.

194
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,674
Excuse me, this is Toshio Kimura.

195
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,634
Can you please call his mom?

196
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,136
Oh, he's lost?

197
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,430
No, he's not, they were separated.

198
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,682
Right.

199
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,020
And your first name, Mr. Kimura?

200
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,271
-Toshio.
-Toshio.

201
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,981
Toshio, then.

202
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,151
Wait here a minute, OK?

203
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,281
And you? Are you his sister?

204
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,366
No, no relation.

205
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,286
My whole family's lost.

206
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:36,513
<i>Poor little, poor little lost pussy cat</i>

207
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,565
Stop crying, we're here.

208
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,638
What? She went with her mother?

209
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,848
I'm her mother!

210
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,600
Oh, is that so?

211
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,561
How dare you give her to a stranger!

212
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,315
Maybe it wasn't her mother,
but it was no stranger.

213
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,110
No stranger? Who could it be?

214
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
I don't know anyone...

215
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,074
Someone pretending to be friendly.

216
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,411
No, she recognized Nonoko.

217
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,538
That wasn't her mother!

218
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,832
Calm down! And then?

219
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm terribly sorry.

220
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,255
Nonoko went off happily with someone

221
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,091
who seemed like her mother.

222
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,553
Oh no! Who can it be?

223
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,847
Will you please page Nonoko?

224
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,684
Actually... they went out
that exit together.

225
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,643
Not here.

226
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,561
Come on!

227
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,193
That's some family.

228
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,122
Dad, where are you racing off to?

229
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,040
-I'm chasing it!
-What?

230
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,543
The car Nonoko's in!

231
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,919
What kind of car?

232
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,262
We don't even know which way it went!

233
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,433
She'll be fine.
Nonoko knew the lady, right?

234
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,435
I bet she took her home.

235
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,354
I'm sure Noboru's right.

236
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,233
Sure, that must be it.

237
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,403
Don't be so sure.
You can't trust anyone these days.

238
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,654
Mother!

239
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,158
Don't you think
you should notify the police?

240
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,534
The police!

241
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,161
How would we explain?

242
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,622
Make a full confession.

243
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,956
Confession?

244
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,961
That four grown people neglected
and abandoned a young girl.

245
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,381
Say, does Nonoko have a key?

246
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,926
Let's go home!

247
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,167
Nonoko!

248
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,964
Nonoko!

249
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,340
Nonoko!

251
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:02,970
Nonoko!

252
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,267
Not here.

253
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,686
Of course not, it was locked.

254
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,067
Hello.

255
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,571
Oh, thank goodness!

256
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,825
Thank you! Thank you so much!

257
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,247
Thank you!
We were looking everywhere for her.

258
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,416
I'm so sorry for all this.

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,255
Yes, we'll be right over.

260
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,591
You even made her dinner!

261
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:47,848
You're so very kind.
How can we possibly thank you?

262
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,064
They finally got home.

263
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,775
They're coming right over.

264
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,193
I'm sorry, auntie.

265
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,821
Oh, it's nothing.

266
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:07,576
I can't wait to hear
their side of the story.

267

<i>Stopping.</i>

275
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,109
Can you stand back, ma'am?

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,118
Oh, dear, it started raining.

278
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,501
The laundry!

279
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,924
Huh?

280
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,515
What's the fuss?

281
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,439
That's right! I'd already brought it in.

282
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,525
You never even hung it up!

283
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,446
I'm going out. Can I get you anything?

284
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,158
Oh! There was something.

285
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:16,246
What was it? Uhm... Uhm...

286
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,083
OK, then, I'm going.

287
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,423
It's just that... Oh, what was it?

288
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,644
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

289
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,438
What is it?

00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,277
Uhm... That is... Uhm...

00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,905
Why don't you just give up?

292
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,408
Oh! Bread!

293
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,122
Get it yourself!

294
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,458
Mom!

295
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,461
Money, money.

296
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,255
I'm home.

297
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,509
I guess Mom's not here.

298
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,930
Wow, noodles.

299
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,307
And the water's boiling.

300
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,810
Great, I'll go ahead and eat them.

301
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,319
Oh, you're home.

302
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,956
You were hiding!

303
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,337
Hm?

304
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,590
The bulb's out.

305
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,551
That's no good. Better change it.

306
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,306
Oh, darn... no spares.

307
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,226
Switch it with one you're not using.

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,854

00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,117

Mr. Tanaka says he's coming over.

What? Oh, no.

320
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,696
Better tidy up a little.

321
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,244
Ouch.

322
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,467
Hey, what are you doing?

323
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,552

No, it's not.

327
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,199

328
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,076
<i>It isn't here.</i>

00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,539
It's a manila envelope
that says OKK in red.

332
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,046

That's 20 years of marriage for you.

I meant the paper.

Sure.

Lettuce, cucumber, ham,
light bulbs, and garbage bags.

343
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,956
I'll make a list.

344
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,040
No, I've got it.

345
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,964
Lettuce, cucumber, ham...

346
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,675
light bulbs, and garbage bags, right?

347
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,176
I told you.

348
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,054
All I forgot was to buy them.

349

351
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,653
Make up your mind.

Oh, you're still here?

358
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,802
What do you mean, "still"?

359
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,638
Can't I rest on my day off?

360
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,641
Usually, you're off at Pachinko.

00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,479
Nope, I'm giving it a rest.
How about some tea?

362
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,857
And noodles for lunch.

363
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,275
Yes, dear.

364
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,155
Actually, make that coffee, not tea!

365
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,370
And the bathroom's a wreck.

366
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,289
Clean it up.

367
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,001
And when you go shopping,
I need cigarettes.

368
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,129
What a pain in the neck!

369
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,511
Honey! Honey!

370
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,681
Where's your mother?

371
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,475
Out playing Pachinko.

372
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,272
<i>...only one sacrifice fly</i>
<i>in the fifth inning.</i>

373
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,733
<i>Kuwata has pitched.</i>

374
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,613
<i>And he hits it. Right where he wants it.</i>
<i>But he's there to catch it.</i>

375
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,991
<i>And he catches it with ease.</i>
<i>That's the third out.</i>

376
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,368
<i>The Giants will move to</i>

377
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,911
<i>the offense in the bottom</i>

378
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,039
<i>of the eighth inning with one out.</i>

379
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,042
<i>Tonight's program will be extended...</i>

380
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,711
My program's about to start.

381
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,922
<i>In the top of the eighth inning,</i>

382
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,258
<i>Kuwata really showed his skills.</i>

383
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,219
<i>As a pitcher,</i>
<i>he is a brilliant defense player.</i>

384
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,930
<i>He really is.</i>

385
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,056
It's not over.

386
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,809
But I was looking forward to it.

387
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,893
No.

388
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,436
It's a movie!

389
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,763
Now nobody can watch.

390
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,891
This is much more fun.

391
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,325
I win!

392
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,675
Hey, Noboru.

393
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,927
Wanna play catch?

394
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,638
Yeah.

395
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,555
MALE BONDING

396
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,057
NO TRESPASSING

397
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,565
Wait, the dad's supposed to be
the catcher.

398
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,442
Give me a break.

399
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,408
OK, this signal is for a curveball,
this is for a fastball,

400
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,326
and this is for a slider.

401
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,662
Give me a break.

402
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,873
Two outs, bases loaded,
you're the relief pitcher.

403
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,751
I'm the starting pitcher type.

404
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,169
Give me a break!

405
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,255
Are you nuts?

406
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,882
The team never even lets you pitch.

407
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,552
That's why I want to start now.

408
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,931
I see. OK, let's see
this starting pitcher pitch.

409
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,060
It's still two outs, bases loaded.

410
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,186
What?

411
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,912
OK, pitch.

412
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,003
Goddammit!

413
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,884
What are you listening to?

414
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,598
Listening over and over
will improve my English.

415
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,187
It's not that easy.

416
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,189
In my experience...

417
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,274
Study!

418
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,192
Study!

419
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,737
Study!

420
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,510
Repetition just doesn't work.

421
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,803
I'm not you.

422
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,061
How about a drop of sake?

423
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,105
-Sure.
-But, dear...

424
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,823
Pretty awful, huh?

425
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
A little dry.

426
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,996
-What did you say?
-Have you been...?

427
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,669
Noboru!

428
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,920
Noboru!

429
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,932
Hey, Noboru, let's play catch.

430
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,810
Why?

431
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,107
Why? It's a form of parent-child bonding.

432
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,443
Then it doesn't have to be catch.

433
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,238
I get your point, but...

434
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,617
We need the right setting.

435
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,412
Forget it. Can't be bothered.

436
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,555
Kids these days.

437
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,105
A serious generation gap.

438
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,195
PATERNAL SUPREMACY RESTORED

439
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,075
Don't mix your rice into the soup!

440
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,702
It's bad manners.

441
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,371
Pour the soup over the rice.

442
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,959
Excuse me, Father...

443
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,712
What? Got a problem with that?

444
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,215
Oh, suit yourself!

445
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,806
See? Cement, then water.

446
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,309
Uhm...

447
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,395
Hmm...

448
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,814
Quit dawdling. Make a choice.

449
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,360
Use your chopsticks with purpose.

450
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,988
That's my plate.

451
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,615
Excuse me.

452
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,910
You bit it, it's yours.

453
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,293
Help me think of
an independent study topic.

454
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,087
Think for yourself.

455
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,714
It's "independent study," right?

456
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,468
I know, but I'm coming up blank.

457
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,013
You're free to do anything?

458
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,598
Right, free.

459
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,808
But...

460
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:54,689
Total freedom makes it tough, doesn't it?

461
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,399
Exactly.

462
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,735
Complete freedom...

463
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,040
Absolute freedom of choice...

464
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,301
Glorious freedom...
The freedom of dreams...

465
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,637
But when it comes on a silver platter...

466
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,519
I haven't got a clue.

467
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,277
Now he's a philosopher.

468
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,864
He's probably worrying about
his retirement.

469
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,908
FATHER AS ROLE MODEL

470
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,340
The first snow!

471
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,387
‎POCHI

472
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,854
First snow! Let's take a picture!

473
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,440
Why?

474
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,067
How childish.

475
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,110
Shut the door. It's cold.

476
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,806
Where's the camera?

477
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,226
In the top drawer, where else?

478
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,775
It's gone!

479
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,490
The camera's supposed to be here.

480
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,702
This is the best part.

481
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,309
<i>A lone figure, back turned,</i>
<i>receding into the mist.</i>

482
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,852

YAMADA TAKASHI

485
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,323
Happy New Year!

486
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,991
<i>New Year's Cards.</i>

487
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,787
Ready!

488
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,582
-Go!
-Mine, mine,

489
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:48,005
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's,

490
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:53,886
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's,

491
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,973
Mother's, Matsuko's, Nonoko's...

492
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,810
Thirty-one seconds! A new record.

493
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,647
Not bad.

494
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,402
<i>The Thick of Winter.</i>

495
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,035
Think I'll just...

496
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,662
Get me some cake.

497
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,704
Cola for me.

498
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,664
And tangerines.

499
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,832
The stove needs kerosene.

500
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,213
Thank you!

501
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,017
<i>Spring Showers.</i>

502
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,646
Can you bring my umbrella?

503
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,774
<i>Your father needs his umbrella.</i>

504
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,361
<i>Why me? I'm studying.</i>

505
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,864
<i>You should go.</i>
<i>Walk in the rain with your man.</i>

506
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,535
<i>I don't have the energy.</i>

507
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,830
<i>Noboru! You go, please.</i>

508
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,081
<i>Make Nonoko go.</i>

509
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,667
Forget it! I'll buy one.

510
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,961
<i>Pick up some pork.</i>

511
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,212
Idiots!

512
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,419
<i>A spring shower, dressed for rain,</i>
<i>talking as they go.</i>

513
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,587
<i>Buson.</i>

514
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,806
Strange... Where's Noboru's sock?

515
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,934
Nonoko's pajamas and Dad's towel?

516
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,395
Pajamas? Socks?

517
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,896
And his towel.

518
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,402
Hey, wait...

519
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,738
This means...

520
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,705
I knew it!

521
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,582
The Black Hole!

522
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,001
THE PERFECT COMBO

523
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,506
Maybe we'll order sushi in for dinner.

524
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:23,387
Oh, what a waste of money!
I'll make the sushi.

525
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,722
Just as I hoped.

526
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,646
Say, Mother...

527
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:36,358
Sushi's not interesting.
I thought I'd go gourmet.

528
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,363
I see. So, what is it?

529
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,324
Beef Stroganoga...

530
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,577
Don't cook what you can't spell.

531
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,786
Well, excuse me!

532
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,708
It's Beef Stroganoff, right?

533
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,793
You knew all along.

534
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,837
I know very well.

535
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:02,009
Beef Stroganoga is just
the Strogaffgaff of beef.

536
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,303
Whatever, just make it.

537
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,765
Darn. I was really counting on sushi.

538
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,826
No good. I screwed it up. Order the sushi.

539
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,245
BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS

540
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,710
Wow, miso soup, fried egg, and seaweed.

541
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,506
A real Japanese breakfast.

542
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,508
Well, actually...

543
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,512
Nonoko's leftovers?

544
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:49,640
Yesterday's soup?

545
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,559
Extra seaweed from lunch?

546
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,437
Precisely!

547
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,191
Today's your lucky day.

548
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,317
Hardly!

549
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,696
Take care.

550
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,200
Matsuko.

551
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,087
When's lunch, Matsuko?

552
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:26,677
What are you talking about? We just ate.

553
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,638
You're too young to be senile.

554
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,390
Are you sure?

555
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,143
The noodles, a few... Oops!

556
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,774
I ate them all myself.

557
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,234
Hey!

558
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,994
-What's for dinner?
-Shabu shabu.

559
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,291
We have it all the time.

560
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,668
Shabu shabu's perfect for winter.

561
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,716
OK, help yourselves.

562
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,177
This way, she doesn't have to cook.

563
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,848
Cold noodles for lunch again?

564
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,725
That's what we had yesterday!

565
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,144
And the day before.

566
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,478
That doesn't make sense!

567
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,107
And again tomorrow!?

568
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,986
Noodles! What else?

569
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,823
Lots of free ginger
in the garden to go with it.

570
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,993
GINGER MORNING

571
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,624
The ginger's good in miso soup.

572
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:43,253
Yes, though they do say
it makes you forgetful.

573
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,673
Oh, dear. He left his bag.

574
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,510
He's bound to notice.
He can't be that dumb.

575
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,597
-Right.
-Oh, no, I forgot...

576
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,734
to take off my pajamas!

577
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,365
I'm off.

578
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,449
OK.

579
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,328
Have a nice day.

580
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,292
I'm off.

581
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,421
My shoes!

582
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,302
Mom, look!

583
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,930
Dad!

584
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,890
What's all the fuss?

585
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,475
My train!

586
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,643
I'll be late!

587
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,812
Be careful.

588
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,359
I'm off to school.

589
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,820
Off you go.

590
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,908
Can't even close the door behind them.

591
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,544
What's this?

592
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,714
Oh, Nonoko forgot her lunch.

593
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,382
She needs it by noon?

594
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,134
Sure, but...

595
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,096
Fine, I'll take it to her
when I go shopping.

596
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,473
That'll really be a help.

597
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,855
I'm off.

598
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,357
OK. Thank you.

599
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:33,905
What's this?

600
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,454
Oh, no, she's forgotten
her purse and everything.

601
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,417
She'll be back.

602
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,424
Watch the house, OK?

603
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,931
Oh no! I left the kettle on.

604
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,519
‎POCHI

605
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,606
Mrs. Yamada, delivery!

606
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,401
Are they out?

607
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,156
No, they're in.

608
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,575
Oh, Mrs. Yamada.

609
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,624
Oh, I did turn it off.

610
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,335
Were you robbed?

611
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,764
Here's your package.

612
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,392
Oh, thank you.

613
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,353
Your seal?

614
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,854
Oh, sorry.

615
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,192
Let's see... Where do I keep it?

616
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,862
It's in the back of the second drawer.

617
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,781
Oh, goodness.

618
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,243
Always a pleasure.

619
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,577
Thank you.

620
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,500
I delivered Nonoko's lunch.

621
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:13,004
Why, Mother, I thought
you were going shopping.

622
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,007
Oops, I forgot.

623
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,680
Too much ginger!

624
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,142
REGRET

625
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,700
Say...

626
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,289
Is that Mahler?

627
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,045
I didn't know she was
a classical music fan.

628
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,443
ART IS BRIEF LIFE IS LONG

629
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,200
They're in full bloom.

630
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,792
I wonder how many more times
I'll see the cherry blossoms.

631
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:38,340
Don't be silly, Mother. You're only 70.

632
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,843
Thirty more seasons?

633
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,192
Mom, will you go pay the taxes?

634
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,485
Leave it to me.

635
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,073
You hand it to the clerk, got that?

636
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,951
I know. Don't treat me like a child.

637
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:15,001
Oh, dear, what a terrible calamity.

638
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,169
POST OFFICE

639
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,421
I'm really going senile.

640
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,966
Nice to see you.

641
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,343
Take care, bye.

642
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,599
I put it in the mail box!

643
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:41,069
Why, Shige.
Thanks for coming to visit.

644
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,990
Well, I heard you were
suddenly hospitalized.

645
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,909
You'll never believe it.

646
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,286
Have a seat.

647
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,713
You see...

648
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,755
Yes.

649
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,299
Look.

650
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,345
See the guy visiting
that patient over there?

651
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,474
I'm sure they're having an affair.

652
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,851
What?

653
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,397
Are you sure?

654
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:22,402
They definitely look suspicious to me!

655
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,824
Suspicious, right?

656
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,748
This is a special room.

657
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:39,169
That notorious city councilman
accused of corruption is in there now.

658
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:47,218
I occasionally come up here
for a breath of fresh air.

659
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,604
These noodles are pretty good, right?

660
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,481
They are.

661
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,907
But the coffee's really lousy here.

662
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,829
By the way, why are you in the hospital?

663
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,505
Oh, Shige!

664
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:33,807
<i>No sign of death's approach</i>
<i>in the cicada's voices.</i>

665
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,849
<i>Basho.</i>

666
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,482
Why, Mother.

667
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,486
Turn on the light.

668
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:51,324
Oh, I hadn't noticed it getting dark.

669
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,256
Noboru! Turn off your light.

670
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,507
I'm not asleep!

671
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,595
AGE COMES MORE EASILY THAN WISDOM

672
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,642
Five problems left. I'm so sleepy.

673
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,897
A hot bath will wake you up.

674
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,081
In you go.

675
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,800
-Feel better?
-Yup! I'm wide awake.

676
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:57,056
OK, here goes!

677
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,227
Here goes. Here goes.

678
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,688
Here goes...

679
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,660
He's as limp as a noodle.

680
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,498
Don't give up.

681
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:26,169
In a fire, the first five minutes count.
In a test, it's the last five minutes.

682
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,514
Time's up. Turn in your papers.

683
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,848
MIDTERM EXAM

684
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:42,852
Ma'am!

685
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,856
Tanaka went to
the nurse's office for ten minutes!

686
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,107
Yes?

687
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,485
That should be "lost time".

688
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,695
I'm afraid not.

689
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,954
Put them in the upstairs closet?

690
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:01,871
Sure.

691
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,610
Why's Noboru studying like a demon?

692
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:37,156
His exams are over.

693
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,866
He did miserably.

694
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,631
About Noboru's tutor...

695
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,383
He really needs one?

696
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,802
He's my son, after all.

697
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,178
You've got a point.

698
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,352
But isn't it expensive?

699
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:10,481
Three hundred dollars for two sessions
with a university student.

700
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,108
What?

701
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,361
For $300, I'll teach him.

702
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,864
I'll teach him for $200.

703
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,826
Pay me $100, and I'll work harder!

704
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,333
This is getting us nowhere.

705
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,550
<i>Fleeting dreams.</i>
<i>An octopus making its home in a trap,</i>

706
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,469
<i>a summer moon.</i>

707
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,596
<i>Basho.</i>

708
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,021
I'm home!

709
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,689
POCHI

710
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,446
Look, chocolates!

711
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,450
Mommy!

712
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,245
Noboru bought chocolates!

713
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,956
They were a Valentine's Day present!

714
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,918
ADOLESCENCE

715
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:13,753
Gone!

716
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,922
Gone, gone, gone!

717
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,173
I'm home!

718
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,885
Where are those cookies, Nonoko?

719
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,803
I ate them.

720
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,431
What? I got them for a girl!

721
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,974
But...

722
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,267
No ifs, ands, or buts!

723
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,521
Mommy already ate half.

724
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,189
Mother?

725
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,536
Damn... I forgot my umbrella.

726
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,287
Hey, Yamada!

727
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,790
Use my umbrella.

728
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,625
How about you?

729
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,835
I'll be fine.

730
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,840
Say, Tanaka, I forgot my umbrella!

731
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,884
Too bad. Don't catch a cold.

732
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,228
Rejected.

733
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,022
No!

734
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,109
Give it back!

735
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,360
Not after that.

736
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,445
But it's mine.

737
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,571
Thanks for the favor.

738
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,322
-Give it back!
-I said no!

739
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,824
Guess it's a rain date.

740
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,622
Hey, Nakamura.

741
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,249
Back to sock the teacher?

742
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,253
Don't be stupid. I came to tell him
I got into college.

743
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,797
Wow, you made it!

744
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,054
Sir?

745
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,014
No need to run

746
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,849
from Nakamura.

747
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,643
Idiot! Don't believe the rumors.

748
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,147
Hey, Yamada, Yamashita,

749
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,649
let's buy some dirty books.

Hey!

754
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,707
Shoot!

755
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,960
What a coincidence.

756
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:26,093
<i>Tragedy in Bosnia!</i>
You've got serious taste.

757
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,138
Well, Japan's part of a bigger world.

758
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,309
Can I borrow it later?

759
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,814
A real tragedy.

760
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,318
I'm home.

761
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,155
Noboru.

762
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,741
The textbook?

763
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,700
This?

764
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,036
I gave you $10 for it.

765
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:53,621
I want to see it.

766
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,307

767
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725

01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,938
<i>Formula-1 Racing for Students</i>?

769
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,066
It'll help my English and my geography.

770
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,152
You idiot!

771
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,697
You're the one who gave me

772
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,075
<i>The Power Ranger's ABC</i> when I was three!

773
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,454
Noboru, there's a girl on the phone.

774
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,789
What?

775
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,547
Oh, hello.

776
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,799
Oh, yeah, it's me.

777
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,937
Go away!

778
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,318
Oh, no, nothing.

779
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,781
Yeah, yeah, OK.

780
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,495
A girlfriend... with his looks?

781
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,830
A real girlfriend?

782
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,040
His face is red.

783
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,125
Yeah, OK.

784
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,419
Bye, then.

785
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,642
It's pounding away!

786
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:38,893
An irregular heartbeat?

787
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,019
Let's see.

788
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,949
Do you think he's upset?

789
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,868
You insulted him, Mother.

790
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,038
This, from the paragon of motherhood?

791
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,960

Anything to eat?

800
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:18,993
Coming right up.

801
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,753
Red bean cake or banana.

802
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,594
Who the hell would want
to come home to bean cakes

803
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,472
after working hard all day?

804
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,600
OK, a banana.

805
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:46,979
What a jerk! Who wants a banana?

Me too!

811
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,438
I'll have the salmon-rice.

812
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,857
How about you, Mother?

813
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,692
The combination special.

814
01:09:58,944 --> 01:09:59,945
I'll go get it!

815
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,780
Not so fast!

816
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,953

01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,468
You can't do that!

823
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,471
What? But this is...

put a poster up. There's an election.

826
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,895
But, mister...

AWA YOICHIRO

828
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,858
This was the only thing underneath.

829
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,244
If it isn't old Saburo.

830
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,998
This is my territory.

831
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,626
Oh, it's you, Shige.

832
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,712
We might as well work together,
we're volunteers.

833
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,304
That's your side, this is mine.

834
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,015
No trespassing.

835
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:14,770
Amazing, she hasn't changed
a bit in 60 years.

836
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,901
Oh, no, I forgot to take out the garbage.

837
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,073
Oh, well, I'll have to sort it!

838
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,410
Why sort burnables?

839
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,746
Trash can at the station,

840
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,749
Nonoko does the park,
Noboru does the store.

841
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,835
You can't do that!

842
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,170
Why not? It's a great plan.

843
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,547
Off we go.

844
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,048
See you later.

845
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,135
Ouch!

846
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:50,597
I volunteer to clean up the park,
and you dump trash there!

847
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,684
I'm not dumping,
just using the public trash cans.

848
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,811
That's the problem!

849
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,980

Excuse us!

01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,128
Our ball fell in.

853
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:30,220
This new one or this rubber ball?

854
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:33,849
The rubber ball!

855
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:47,571
Honesty's the best policy. Don't ever lie.

856
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,531
OK.

857
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,700
Take this one too.

858
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,328
Wow! Thanks!

859
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:05,464
Excuse me. Our ball fell in yesterday.

860
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,965
But you weren't here.

861
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,510
Didn't see any.

862
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,804
I see...

863
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:15,724
I'm sure this was the house.

864
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:25,984
I beg you, please tell those boys
to give him his new ball back.

865
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,035
Oh, poor things.

866
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,914
You're right, they're all wilted.

867
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,543
Not the flowers! The accident!

868
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,752
Oh, I see.

869
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,588
It was a motorcycle gang.

870
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,009
The poor guard rail.

871
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:51,927
Mother!

872
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:56,432
It was the poor child's parents
who suffered.

873
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,177
They're so loud,
it has to be a motorcycle gang.

874
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,012
They're by the park.

875
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,515
They're the litterbugs!

876
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,975
I'll go scold them.

877
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,894
That's dangerous, Mother!

878
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,438
Someone was recently murdered for that.

879
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,440
{\an8}SENIOR CITIZEN MURDERED

880
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,942
Hmm, I know.

881
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,661
That's worse!

882
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,756
M-mother! Why the get-up?

883
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:14,092
She wants to scold the motorcycle gang.

884
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,136
Won't you stop her, please?

885
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:22,643
You can't wear that hard-hat. It's
a memento from when we built the house.

886
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:26,146
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

887
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,274
I'm sorry, but you can't.

888
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,235
In that case...

889
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,695
you wear it, and go.

890
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,280
Me?

891
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:40,536
They're not vicious.
They'll go home eventually.

892
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:43,830
Then you have nothing to fear.

893
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:47,167
Give them a manly scolding. You're older.

894
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,794
Manly...?

895
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,921
But, Mother...

896
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:53,131
I know, let's report them to 911.

897
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,553
The poor kids. They don't deserve
a criminal record for making noise.

898
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,346
A record!

899
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,781
See, they're gone.

900
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,242
You think?

901
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,587
What did I tell you?

902
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,717
We're relying on you.

903
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,681
All right, I'll just go look.

904
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,561
Be careful, dear!

905
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,736
Uhm, excuse me.

906
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,655
What do you want?

907
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,449
It's awfully late.

908
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,867
Yeah? So what?

909
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,081
Got a problem?

910
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,876
No, we can work this out.
I don't have a problem.

911
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,921
I don't have a problem,

912
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:59,257
-but I do have a request.
-Spit it out.

913
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:02,886
Ask away, old man.

914
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,515
Would you mind turning off your headlight?

915
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,518
So that's your request, then?

916
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:11,853
Uhm, no.

917
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,271
What do you want then?

918
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:24,324
<i>Come, come fireflies</i>
<i>This water's bitter, this water's sweet</i>

919
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,492
What is that?

920
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,582
<i>That water's sweet</i>

921
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,420
<i>Come, fireflies</i>

922
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,880
That old bag's nuts.

923
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,174
Mother, are you all right?

924
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,263
An old bag, huh?

925
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,934
At least turn down that putt-putt.
You're a neighborhood nuisance.

926
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,478
Mother, you can't talk to these low-lifes.

927
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,439
Who you calling low-life?

928
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,983
How exciting!

929
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,736
What a great voice you have.

930
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,945
Mother!

931
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:06,158
And a fine face and physique
to go with it.

932
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:09,286
I bet people shut up when you talk.

933
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:10,454
Get to the point!

934
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:15,542
Oh, scary. You sure
shut this guy up in a hurry.

935
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:16,543
Tell me about it.

936
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:21,840
When you yell at people, it reminds me
of a snake staring down a frog.

937
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:29,598
It sure must be fun shutting people up
and ordering them around.

938
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:30,807
It's OK.

939
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:36,229
I know, why don't you employ
your venom in the cause of justice?

940
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,315
What?

941
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:41,985
Don't you like fighting for justice,
that Masked Rider stuff?

942
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,489
Way old, Granny.

943
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:49,868
Of course, it's not exactly cool,
is it? Nowadays

944
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:53,580
we turn a blind eye
to every kind of misdeed.

945
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:57,334
But I know you could do it
because you're fearless.

946
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:03,340
Someone tosses a cigarette butt
or can from their car,

947
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:06,968
you use that voice of yours,
make them pick it up.

948
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,723
You see a kid causing trouble
on the subway,

949
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,643
you gently tap him on the shoulder.

950
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,855
I'm sure anyone will do whatever you say.

951
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:23,735
We'll all be so happy,
we'll cheer you on.

952
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,659
It's nice to be appreciated.

953
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,745
While you're at it, scare off thugs,

954
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,541
and take the bad guys' money.

955
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:44,089
What do you say, will you heed
an old bag's plea and fight for justice?

956
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:48,635
It'll be a whole lot better
than listening to me rant and rave.

957
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,390
I think this old lady's nuts.

958
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,560
No go?

959
01:20:56,643 --> 01:21:01,064
What a shame, with your godly attributes.

960
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,151
Let's go.

961
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,453
Think about fighting for justice!

962
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,419
Hey, you forgot this.

963
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:35,932
Did he get it?

964
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,934
Mother!

01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,619

01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,196
Did you bring your umbrella home?

978
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:05,243
Your husband's home
from work, exhausted,

979
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:09,581
and all you can ask is, "Did you
bring your umbrella home?"

980
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,417
OK, OK. Welcome home. Have a hard day?

981
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,210
Where's your umbrella?

982
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:16,462
I forgot it.

Look, I remembered
to bring it home, so there, ha!

986
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,315
What? Got a problem?

987
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:40,361
But you didn't take an umbrella today.

988
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:43,615
See?

990
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,328
I bought a cake.

991
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,287
Really?

992
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:53,166
Once in a blue moon.

993
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,586
Guilty conscience?

994

What was that?

995
01:26:57,587 --> 01:27:01,758
That's going too far.
Here, Takashi's thoughtfully gone and

996
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,176
and I even bought custard.

997
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,222
Now that's suspicious.

On a business trip.

1001
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,868
But his briefcase...

1002
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:33,456
Oh no, he must've forgotten it.

1003
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:34,916
And his scarf and train pass.

1004
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:37,877
What? Oh no!

1005
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:41,381
He was supposed to leave early.

1006
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,091
Father!

Yes, yes, I'm terribly sorry.

A slight fever.

1029
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:52,428
You should stay home.

You know, maybe I will.
Make a long weekend of it.

You should, you should.

Now... that is, up until now...

1046
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:04,662

But Ichiro and Kazuko,

1052
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:27,977
you have to accept life as it comes.

1053
01:33:30,896 --> 01:33:34,442
Acceptance is the key to surviving

1054
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:39,905
the worst situations
without losing heart or breaking up.

1055
01:33:40,614 --> 01:33:42,616
Breaking up?

1056
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:46,287
Even the worst behavior

1057
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:52,043
can be accepted and forgiven
if there is no malice.

1058
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:54,920
In fact, it must be forgiven
so one can go on with life!

1059
01:33:55,629 --> 01:33:57,423
Gutsy speech!

1060
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:03,137
It's not necessarily bad
to resign yourself to a situation.

1061
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:05,931
In fact, it's essential.

1062
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:09,060
A must for a happy family.

1063
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:12,063
A must for facing life
and getting on with it.

1064
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,443
Though it may sound negative,

1065
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,238
"acceptance"

1066
01:34:21,655 --> 01:34:26,077
is the only way out of totally
unacceptable situations.

1067
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:33,751
I didn't know he had it in him.
What a man.

1068
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:45,429
Um, well, that is, I mean...

1069
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,353
So, my dear Ichiro and Kazuko,

1070
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,689
congratulations on your wedding.

1071
01:34:57,441 --> 01:35:03,030

would disguise your baldness.

1081
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,084
Who asked you?

1082
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:00,880
-Don't you need dentures, Mother?
-Who asked you?

1083
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:03,382
Cut it out! Both of you!

1084
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:06,886
You're starting to look like
a sumo wrestler.

01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:08,637
-You tell her!
-How dare you?

1086
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:15,519
You're setting a terrible example
in front of the children.

1087
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,105
I can't hear the TV!

1088
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,153
I know why we're so peaceful.

1089
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:28,532
Because all three of you are nuts.

1090
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,160
-How dare you?
-How dare you?

1091
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,997
If even one of you were normal,

1092
01:36:35,664 --> 01:36:37,583
it'd throw off the balance.
