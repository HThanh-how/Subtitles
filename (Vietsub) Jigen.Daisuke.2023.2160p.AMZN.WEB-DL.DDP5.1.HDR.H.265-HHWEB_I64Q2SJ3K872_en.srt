1
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,791
Understand?

2
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,916
Let's go.

3
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,416
Jigen Daisuke.

4
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,375
MEAT

5
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,625
Get up, you!

6
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,791
Kyoko.

7
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,750
Yuya!

8
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,625
You won't get away with this!

9
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
I can't back out of it now!

10
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,416
Yuya... Yuya!

11
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,250
Yuya.

12
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,791
It's this kid.

13
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,416
Move!

14
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,625
Japan...

15
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,708
It's been so long.

16
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,375
First time in Deigyo-gai?

17
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,625
Yes, and last.

18
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,375
People say that,
but they keep coming back.

19
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,958
No smoking, please.

20
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,125
Have some candy.

21
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,291
-Hey, how about a tattoo?
-Like this one.

22
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,875
What do you think, mister?

23
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,125
What do you think?

24
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,291
Hey, handsome.

25
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,125
Hey, handsome.

26
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,500
Hey, got time for some fun?

27
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,166
Hey.

28
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,833
What?

29
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,750
I need to go to a bar called Yamatomi.

30
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,458
You're an outsider.

31
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,208
You know where it is?

32
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,416
Straight down this street
in the Central Hall.

33
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,583
But...

34
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,750
I wouldn't recommend it to an outsider.

35
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll be careful.

36
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,625
If there's trouble,
tell them Ruri sent you.

37
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,208
Here.

38
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,333
I don't charge for kindness.

39
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,333
Thanks.

40
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,791
Bye.

41
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
Hey, fella.

42
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,125
-You're handsome.
-Huh?

43
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,333
-Come with me.
-Can I?

44
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,041
-Of course.
-Really?

45
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,083
YAMATOMI

46
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,916
Here you go.

47
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,250
It's home-brewed.

48
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,916
My old man's secret recipe.

49
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,333
Enjoy.

50
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,666
Sorry.

51
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,583
Long wait?

52
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:24,791
I heard this was a refuge for villains,
but it's not so bad here.

53
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No smoking in the cab?

54
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:35,500
You looked pretty irritated
lighting one up after getting off.

55
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,833
Said who?

56
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Everyone in town.

57
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,791
What a nuisance.

58
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,458
I told the town's boss
that you were my client.

59
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,833
Don't create problems and you'll be okay.

60
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,666
And if I do?

61
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,458
Everyone will be your enemy.

62
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,666
Deigyo-gai fell into ruins
after development plans failed.

63
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,375
Outcasts, who had no place to go,
took over the town

64
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,000
and made it their home.

65
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:25,041
It's their last haven,
so they'll protect it with their life.

66
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,375
I see.

67
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,291
So, about the gunsmith
you're looking for...

68
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,083
The name's Yaguchi.

69
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,208
Yaguchi?

70
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,208
Never heard of him.

71
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,333
A drifter, too?

72
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,666
He doesn't live here.

73
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,083
Used to do business here a long time ago.

74
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,000
He sold guns
to the residents of Koinobori.

75
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,791
Koinobori?

76
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,291
That's where the town's bosses
have always lived.

77
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,625
The new boss, who recently took over,

78
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:23,791
is rounding up mercenaries and killers.

79
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,625
People are happy with the new boss.

80
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,541
If all goes well,
no more running from the law.

81
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,000
If you stay here, you'll cause trouble.

82
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,500
The gunsmith's address.

83
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,958
A clock store
on a half-deserted shopping street.

84
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
Thanks for your trouble.

85
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,875
HIBARI SHOPPING STREET

86
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,625
-We're back.
-Welcome home.

87
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,583
Please take care.

88
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,041
Hey. Hello there.

89
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,458
Come again, okay?

90
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:17,958
Hey!

91
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,791
YAGUCHI CLOCK STORE
SALES AND REPAIRS

92
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,833
-This hurts.
-Come on, do it.

93
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,000
One, two, three, four...

94
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,083
Come on.

95
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,500
-Hey, come on.
-No more. This hurts.

96
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,541
-I'm home.
-Hey.

97
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,291
-Go wash your hands.
-Okay.

98
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,791
-This hurts.
-Go on, go on.

99
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,208
Three more minutes.
Or else I get another apple.

100
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,041
My internal organs
have really gotten weak.

101
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:54,666
-Come on. Go, go.
-One, two, one, two.

102
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,125
It hurts...

103
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,375
Go, go.

104
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,750
For real? A customer?

105
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,875
Is Yaguchi here?

106
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,750
That's me.

107
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,541
-Got a husband? Son?
-It's just me.

108
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,708
So you are...

109
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,458
Hey, what do you want, fella?

110
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,250
What do you want from Chiharu?

111
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
What?

112
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,500
Zenith El Primero A384.

113
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,333
That's a nice watch.
You want to have it repaired?

114
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
This isn't what I need repaired.

115
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,458
I see.

116
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,416
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

117
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,833
-Go make your delivery.
-Right, I almost forgot.

118
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,833
See you.

119
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,041
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

120
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,375
Bye.

121
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:17,500
So you want to repair the thing
stuck in your waistband?

122
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,625
What a surprise.

123
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,500
Are you Jigen Daisuke?

124
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,166
I am.

125
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,583
You're about the only person
who carries a Combat Magnum like this one.

126
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,375
Bullets go astray.

127
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:59,166
I've checked every inch of it,
but can't find the problem.

128
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,375
I'm sorry to say you're not the man
I heard you were.

129
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,875
What do you mean?

130
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,208
If you'd listened closer to your gun,

131
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,500
it wouldn't have gotten this bad.

132
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,666
Take it home.

133
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,250
You can't fix it?

134
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,833
Don't be absurd.

135
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,250
I've retired.

136
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,833
I'm a real watchmaker now.

137
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,041
Are you really selling her?

138
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,208
That again?

139
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,416
Let's run away, the three of us.

140
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,208
Where to?

141
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,458
There's no place to go.
That's why we lived in that dump.

142
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,916
Anything's better than this!

143
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,458
She's not her. You got that?

144
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,541
I'll text you the place
once I have a deal.

145
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
Bring the kid, okay?

146
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,250
Yuya...

147
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,875
HIROSHIGE YASUHARU, TSUBAKI I-GO CLUB

148
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,000
Nice watch.

149
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,708
Informants must get paid well.

150
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,750
That's a fake made by Chiharu Yaguchi.

151
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,083
Even you thought it was real.

152
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,583
That's how good she is.

153
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,541
Unbelievable old woman.

154
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
She's a poor old lady.

155
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,791
"Poor"?

156
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,375
She honed her skills
to become a watchmaker.

157
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:47,458
But back in her day,
watchmaking was a man's world.

158
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:53,458
Not only was she able to copy
the most supreme techniques,

159
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,708
but also her watches
are better than the originals.

160
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,625
But because she made fakes,

161
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,166
she was even more alienated
from the industry.

162
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,791
Only the underworld appreciated her.

163
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:16,083
Recognizing her abilities,
they made her make fake guns.

164
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,166
How ironic.

165
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,166
"I'm a real watchmaker now. "

166
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,166
What?

167
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,208
Nothing.

168
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,833
That's fine.

169
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,250
Then, how about a game?

170
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,583
I'll bet my money, and you'll bet...

171
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,416
this watch.

172
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,333
You know I was a professional i-go player.

173
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:49,708
I also know you were expelled
because of your gambling addiction.

174
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,375
What a persistent man!

175
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,166
I'm here on another matter.

176
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,375
What is it?

177
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,750
Make me a watch.

178
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,416
I came across a watch that you made.

179
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,041
It was superb.

180
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,083
But I failed to get it.

181
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,375
I don't know how much research
you did on me,

182
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,583
but compliments won't make me
repair your gun.

183
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,500
Not all women want to be told
they're beautiful.

184
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,875
I know.

185
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,666
I'd never ask for fish at a meat shop.

186
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,291
You're a watchmaker now.

187
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,291
Hello there, little girl.

188
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,916
What's your name?

189
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,208
Okay.

190
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,958
It's in pretty bad shape.
Let me take a look.

191
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:31,500
Little girl, where did you get this watch?

192
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,208
Body search.

193
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,041
All right.

194
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,375
Not you.

195
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,291
Stay here.

196
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:44,750
If I'm to go in alone,
could you open the door for me?

197
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,791
As you can see, I can't do it myself.

198
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:08,583
I know that Deigyo-gai is
a town of scumbags.

199
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,208
But kidnapping orphans? That's low.

200
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,666
KIDS MISSING FROM ORPHANAGE

201
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,625
You're the scumbag
who's been preying on Deigyo-gai.

202
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,291
Did you call me here to give me a lecture?

203
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,708
Adele.

204
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm praising you.

205
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,791
Your previous boss, whom you killed,
was a pathetic man who lived off women.

206
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,458
But you came up with a new way
to make money.

207
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,541
But just don't go behind my back.

208
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,875
This guy told us everything.

209
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,333
Adele!

210
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:59,208
What made you think of making drugs
using kids as ingredients?

211
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,041
The war.

212
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,916
The war?

213
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:10,875
The enemy nation turned my village
into a human experimentation lab.

214
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,625
What did you do?

215
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,583
I tried to escape, and...

216
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,208
My people will look after Deigyo-gai
as we've always done.

217
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,125
So go ahead and make the drugs.

218
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,541
We'll sell them.

219
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:53,208
And give us pennies for it?

220
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,541
You can't even count pennies
if you're dead.

221
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,791
You're so right.

222
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,500
Kawashima,

223
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,833
that girl is the only suitable donor now.

224
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,208
I'll find her.

225
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,166
This is like an exchange ticket for a gun.

226
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:23,833
Sometime ago, a prostitute in Deigyo-gai
named Kyoko got pregnant.

227
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,250
But her boss made her have an abortion
so she could keep working.

228
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:35,833
So she came to me for a gun
to kill her boss.

229
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,416
You sold her one?

230
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,250
Of course not. I didn't want her dead.

231
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,416
I told her that I had none in stock,

232
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,166
but that the next time,
I'd give her one for the watch.

233
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,416
I lied and sent her home.

234
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,833
So, what are you gonna do?

235
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,250
She kept this old watch,

236
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,583
which means she lived her life
believing my lie.

237
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,666
She's in a fix now.

238
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,750
I've gotta help her.

239
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,958
I hope it's just a little fix.

240
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,958
What do you mean?

241
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:27,166
A woman who suffered losing a child
used a child to get a gun.

242
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,041
That means she's in serious trouble.

243
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,000
Send her home.

244
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,500
You're a watchmaker now.

245
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,958
Won't you go with her in my place?

246
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,958
I know you can help Kyoko.

247
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,833
No, I'm not doing it.

248
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,166
Why not?

249
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,125
I can't stand kids.

250
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,583
I don't understand them,
and they irritate me.

251
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,000
The answer's "no. "

252
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,916
What if I said I'd go back to my past life

253
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,583
and take a look at your gun?

254
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:30,708
By the way...

255
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,583
She's so slow.

256
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,916
Which train did you take?

257
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,666
You don't know?

258
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,625
What color was it?

259
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,333
Tell me anything you remember.

260
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,333
Is it possible that...

261
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,916
you can't talk?

262
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,916
Do you know Kyoko's address?

263
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,125
Write the color of the train.

264
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,458
BLUE

265
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,708
Your name?

266
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,958
OTO

267
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,833
Let's go.

268
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,833
Keep it.

269
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,208
So, where to now?

270
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,666
YAMANOURA BEACH

271
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,750
Give it back when the sun stops
blinding you.

272
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,958
You got an underground workshop.

273
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,000
Perfect for when you live in the shadows.

274
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,666
This is all I got now.

275
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,041
I made it myself.

276
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,375
My first time.

277
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,791
No way.

278
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,541
You've never used anything but revolvers?

279
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,166
Nothing this good.

280
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,041
The original gun's flaws have been fixed.

281
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,375
Why are you fixated on your Combat Magnum?

282
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:26,208
With your skills, any gun should do.

283
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It was the first one I got.

284
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,250
You mean, the first type of gun?

285
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:38,166
No, otherwise I'd get a new one.
It was my very first gun ever.

286
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,791
You mean, you've been using
your first gun,

287
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:46,125
and replacing parts as needed?

288
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:52,958
If so, there's probably not even
a screw left of the original parts.

289
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,458
But there are memories left.

290
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:04,041
Contrary to your looks,
you're such a romantic.

291
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,291
That's not a bad thing.

292
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,833
I'll take a look around.

293
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,416
You stay here.

294
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,125
One...

295
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,000
Two...

296
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,500
Three.

297
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,750
I can feel your bloodlust.

298
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,666
Get out!

299
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:22,875
Shut up!

300
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,541
Shut up and do as I say!

301
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,166
You hear me?

302
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,500
Stop bawling!

303
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,166
Don't make me repeat myself!

304
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,166
Don't look back.

305
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,291
Let's get out of here.

306
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,416
We're letting him go?

307
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,833
That was Jigen Daisuke.

308
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,333
I see you feel completely deflated.

309
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,041
That's only normal.

310
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,875
You can't go up against him
without preparation.

311
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,041
That would be suicidal.

312
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What do we do?

313
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:28,375
I'd heard he was in town,
but I never thought we'd cross paths.

314
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,333
Tail him and find out where he goes.

315
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,125
Hey, don't stop!

316
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,833
Hop on.

317
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,041
Hurry up!

318
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,750
Mr. Akiyama, we've been expecting you.

319
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:34,708
Is this really so much better
than other drugs?

320
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:41,958
It gives you much more
than hallucinations and euphoria.

321
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,708
What does it do exactly?

322
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,833
It slows down aging.

323
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:51,250
So, what you get is... time.

324
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,375
That's Interpol's wanted list.

325
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,333
Look at my age.

326
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,916
Fifty-two years old.

327
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,958
It's fake, right?

328
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,208
It's easy to verify.

329
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,541
Why would I tell you such a stupid lie?

330
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,958
Why would I pay you
under such uncertain circumstances?

331
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:36,916
I've no intention of getting paid by you
in the first place.

332
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,375
What do you mean?

333
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,833
I'll keep giving you priority.

334
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,416
So bring me customers.

335
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:55,583
Politicians, police officers, financiers.

336
00:42:56,416 --> 00:43:01,750
People with power in respectable society.

337
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,708
What do you intend to do?

338
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,375
I'm going to gain power...

339
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:11,541
that no one can take away.

340
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,583
Did you find the girl?

341
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,000
We did, but...

342
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,125
You couldn't get her?

343
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,625
Jigen Daisuke was with her.

344
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,708
I'm terribly sorry.

345
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,458
It's all right.

346
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,958
Being with Jigen is...

347
00:43:55,875 --> 00:44:00,375
like walking around
with the world's flashiest placard.

348
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:27,166
S... top.

349
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,791
S... top.

350
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:38,833
S... top.

351
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm glad you went with her.

352
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:47,166
No telling what would've happened
if I'd gone.

353
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:53,708
Kyoko was tortured by professionals.

354
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,250
She was in a bigger trouble
than we thought.

355
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,333
-Hey.
-Yes?

356
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,250
Pour me some.

357
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,916
You said Oto can't talk, right?

358
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,666
Yeah.

359
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,000
She talked in her sleep.

360
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,583
She did?

361
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:34,625
She kept saying "stop"
over and over again.

362
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,291
She could have aphonia.

363
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,291
What's that?

364
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,500
-A mental disorder.
-What?

365
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:50,000
Emotional stress can sometimes
cause a person to lose their voice.

366
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,375
I'll bring her to the police station.

367
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,583
And tell them what?

368
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:05,833
Tell them you deal guns?
You'll end up in jail.

369
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,958
I don't have that much time left.

370
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:14,416
I'll think of it as an old folks' home
with strict regulations.

371
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:22,083
At least wait until we find out
how Oto and Kyoko are connected.

372
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:26,541
Maybe we can find a home for the kid.

373
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,958
When did you...

374
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:04,333
I don't know where Jigen is.

375
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:09,041
Not even a blink
with all these guns in your face.

376
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,875
You're quite the man.

377
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:17,166
No wonder you were so famous
before you lost your arm.

378
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,125
You were famous too,

379
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:24,708
as a coward who loved
playing hide-and-seek.

380
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:34,583
But I'm putting an end to that.

381
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:45,000
With luck, we'll see each other again.

382
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,916
Hey!

383
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:10,916
Quit taking on perverted clients.

384
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:16,625
But someone's gotta deal with those guys.

385
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:22,375
Look, you got blood on you again.

386
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:31,041
There was a rowdy fella at the bar.

387
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,541
You get hurt more often
since she became the boss.

388
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,041
I worry about you.

389
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:47,625
We still need her,
if we want to make this town better.

390
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:53,875
I'll make sure you quit this job
no matter what.

391
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,125
I don't dislike this...

392
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:38,750
Got a cigarette?

393
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,208
Of course.

394
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,375
Here.

395
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,791
What?

396
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,041
Well...

397
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,208
You never smoke in public.

398
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,500
-I don't wanna reek.
-No.

399
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:29,375
So, it means this time
is just for you and me.

400
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:00,791
Hello.

401
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,958
Speaking.

402
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,166
Jigen Daisuke?

403
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,958
"New parts have subtle differences,

404
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:41,625
"and some are incompatible
with each other.

405
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,916
"That's why you can't just confirm
how all the parts work.

406
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,708
"It's been your long-time partner, right?

407
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,250
"Listen to what it says.

408
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,833
"You should be able to understand it. "

409
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,041
Hey!

410
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,958
Wait!

411
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,625
Where are you going?

412
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,375
The old lady's trying to help you.

413
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,666
Wait until she comes back.

414
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,291
Where's the notebook?

415
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,875
You left it?

416
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,458
I gave...

417
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,500
I gave that to you.

418
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,208
You need it, right?

419
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Let's go.

420
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,250
What do you want?

421
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,000
So...

422
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:29,250
You're her nephew. She told me.

423
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,333
And she's your daughter.

424
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,958
You're cute.

425
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,958
Good thing you don't look like your dad.

426
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:42,875
Chiharu wanted food delivered,
but we weren't open yet.

427
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:47,958
You're going to get lunch?
Come on, I'll fix you something.

428
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,333
Drop by my place later.

429
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:59,250
Chiharu's nephew is welcome any time.

430
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:13,541
The way you eat!
What if your kid imitates you?

431
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,791
Look away.

432
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:43,416
DEIGYO-GAI TOWN

433
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,958
They all carry guns.
This is a dangerous town.

434
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,708
-How are you?
-What's up, Chiharu?

435
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:20,125
I came too early.
Maybe she's still sleeping?

436
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:24,500
Is that you, Chiharu?

437
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,333
I know that voice.

438
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,333
-Ruri!
-Hey, Chiharu!

439
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,958
-It's been so long.
-Yeah.

440
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,125
There.

441
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,291
Here you go.

442
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,541
So, what's up?

443
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,291
Kyoko...

444
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,083
is dead.

445
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,166
What?

446
00:55:56,208 --> 00:56:00,000
I have the girl she was with.

447
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:03,958
Do you know if she had relatives?

448
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,000
Wait a second. I'm totally confused.

449
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,833
First of all, Kyoko had no family.

450
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:14,125
Besides, she became infertile.

451
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:19,666
You run things around here,
so I thought you might know something.

452
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:32,583
Adele!

453
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:35,500
What a surprise to see you around here.
What's up?

454
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,375
I've been busy lately.

455
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:45,000
But I heard
that Yaguchi Chiharu was in town.

456
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:50,166
Gosh, word travels fast in this town.

457
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:55,125
I heard you sold guns to the former boss.

458
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:04,208
Yes, he said they were
for protecting this town.

459
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,250
But I heard he was quite a brute.

460
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,333
I'm not criticizing you.

461
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:16,625
My mechanical voice just can't express
the nuances I want to get across.

462
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,458
So, what do you want?

463
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:25,708
I want to do business with you too.

464
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:32,500
I'm sorry, but I've already retired.

465
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,916
It doesn't look that way.

466
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,958
All right, then.

467
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,875
We'll talk again.

468
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,625
It's empty.

469
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,583
Are you done writing?

470
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:39,916
Can I see it?

471
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,875
MR. TAKAHASHI HIT HARDER WHEN I CRIED.

472
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:10,583
HE HIT ME.

473
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,875
I CRIED.

474
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:20,166
MOM

475
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,541
GOT STABBED.

476
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:30,208
HE DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME FOOD ANYMORE.

477
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:33,666
I TRIED TO SPEAK, BUT NO VOICE CAME OUT.

478
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,708
I WAS SCARED.

479
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,708
THEY KIDNAPPED ME.

480
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:41,416
THEY TOOK MY BLOOD.

481
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,375
I COULDN'T HELP CRYING.

482
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:50,791
I CRIED

483
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:55,375
AND I LOST MY VOICE.

484
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,583
Damn!

485
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:50,541
You don't like milk?

486
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:57,750
You didn't drink any last time either.

487
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:28,166
I'M SORRY.

488
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,541
I'm going out to get some cigarettes.

489
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,458
Wanna come along?

490
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:15,875
Same one.

491
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:20,750
-It's not sold in Japan anymore.
-What?

492
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:23,750
-Any other brand you want?
-I only smoke this.

493
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,125
I have something similar.

494
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:31,000
-Forget it.
-Hey...

495
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:38,166
You might want a smaller notebook.

496
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,250
Let's get one there.

497
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,333
That's too big to carry around, huh?

498
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,500
Whatever. Follow me.

499
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:19,833
Here.

500
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:30,500
It's a bit long.

501
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,833
Turn around.

502
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:43,833
Look away.

503
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,333
Done.

504
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:22,458
-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

505
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,625
Where have you been?

506
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,125
Who was that?

507
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,541
A renovation salesperson.

508
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:51,166
She was desperate,
so I let her give me an estimate.

509
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,500
I see.

510
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,875
I see you got a string for your notebook.

511
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:06,291
He should've gotten you
a prettier notebook.

512
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:10,541
He doesn't understand girls, does he?

513
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:18,375
-Good evening.
-Oh, good evening.

514
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:28,500
How was Deigyo-gai?

515
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,916
I asked around,

516
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,375
but no one knew anything about Oto.

517
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:37,958
How about Kyoko?

518
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:43,958
It seems she disappeared
only very recently.

519
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:48,083
No one noticed anything different.

520
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,708
What's wrong?

521
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,666
It doesn't add up.

522
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,833
A kid abducted from an orphanage

523
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:05,416
was rescued by a woman from Deigyo-gai.

524
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,708
Where did they meet,
the woman and the kid?

525
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:17,875
Deigyo-gai residents
don't go out into the outside world.

526
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:22,333
Right, they're all on the run or hiding.

527
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,458
The kid was kidnapped

528
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,916
by Deigyo-gai.

529
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:31,666
What?

530
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,708
Gotta get the kid out of here.

531
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:48,416
Looks like we were too late.
Wait down there.

532
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:04,750
Stop!

533
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,791
I can't use this here.

534
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,166
Silencer, eh? How nice.

535
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,750
The gas leak is a bluff.

536
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,875
Stay back!

537
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,125
Aren't you too old to play hide-and-seek?

538
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,083
That's why...

539
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,041
I greeted you earlier with a big smile.

540
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,083
You...

541
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:17,166
Drop the gun and kick it over.

542
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,500
I'm sorry.

543
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:44,916
It's all right.

544
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,208
I guess one shot won't hurt.

545
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,916
Chiharu!

546
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,041
What's happening?

547
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:21,416
When she suffered trauma as a child,
her body released anti-stress hormones.

548
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:27,208
The high level of these hormones
is what makes her a suitable donor.

549
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:32,333
Trauma as bad as getting a leg cut off
and losing your voice?

550
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,625
Yes.

551
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:41,708
The amount released
will decrease with time,

552
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:49,416
and like you, she will eventually
cease to be a suitable donor.

553
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:53,958
You must find the next donor
as soon as possible.

554
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,500
Don't worry.

555
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:04,208
With poverty spreading as fast as it is,
we're sure to have more suitable donors.

556
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,375
How long has it been?

557
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:00,875
Two days.

558
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:05,708
The doctor was an old man
who retired years ago.

559
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:09,791
So don't complain
about the uneven stitches.

560
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:15,750
Where are the bodies?

561
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:19,916
The only things left there
were a pool of blood and this.

562
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:28,250
They were using
Colt Government M1911s with silencers.

563
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,125
You made them. I knew it
as soon as I gripped one.

564
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:37,791
I used to sell them
to Deigyo-gai in the old days.

565
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,375
It seems you were right about this.

566
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:43,708
Yeah.

567
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,666
Now leave.

568
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,375
No need for you to get caught too.

569
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:52,708
The police?

570
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:56,000
What else can we do to save Oto?

571
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:00,833
Why sacrifice yourself?

572
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:08,541
I've made tools that killed people,
so this is my redemption.

573
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:16,958
Hey, Chiharu!

574
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:20,833
-Are you home?
-Get ready.

575
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:24,625
Yes, I'm coming!

576
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:31,125
-No one bought them.
-But...

577
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:35,791
They aren't for you.
They're for your nephew's girl.

578
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:40,083
Here. I'm putting it right here. Okay?

579
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:45,791
You never talk about yourself,

580
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,958
and you're a bit of a mystery.

581
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:53,166
Then we found out you had a nephew,

582
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,791
so the whole shopping street got excited.

583
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:59,916
So let us enjoy these happy times.

584
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:04,458
-Thanks.
-See you.

585
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,416
Here.

586
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,625
They're all good-natured folks.

587
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:13,625
Bunch of busybodies.

588
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:15,875
I can't throw this away.

589
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:17,333
Take them with you.

590
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,958
I don't care for sweet stuff.

591
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,666
Let me borrow this a bit longer.

592
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,291
You're not...

593
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:38,000
What can the police do for you?

594
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,291
Well...

595
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:45,250
They may catch the villains,
but they can't save the kid.

596
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:50,333
I don't know what happened in her past,

597
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:55,833
but she thinks it's all her fault.

598
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:03,583
Even when she was terrified,

599
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:11,125
she kept apologizing to me
until the last moment.

600
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:23,291
Tell me.

601
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:29,708
Don't you want to know
what she sounds like when she laughs?

602
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,916
This was the best I could do.

603
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:03,250
It's fine.

604
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:17,875
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I got caught in a traffic jam.

605
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,541
Here are the flowers you ordered.

606
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,041
This being your first purchase,
I gave you some freebies.

607
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,416
Hope to serve you again in the future.

608
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,000
What was that?

609
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:01,750
According to him, he's a florist.

610
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:07,541
He selects flowers based
on the information on the order sheet.

611
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,500
These are chamomile.

612
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:15,000
This flower symbolizes
strength in adversity.

613
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:25,041
I told him they were unnecessary,

614
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:28,250
but you're synonymous with
the Magnum cartridges.

615
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,833
He's such a bandwagoner.

616
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,333
I'll keep them for good luck.

617
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,958
This is the boss.

618
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,166
Adele.

619
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,000
You know her?

620
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:47,291
No, but I've heard her name before.

621
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:54,583
She was in the South East Asian gang,
but she was framed and fled to Deigyo-gai.

622
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:57,875
Quick draw. She's second to none.

623
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:02,458
She fought enemies
in her wheelchair and survived.

624
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,375
That shows how good she is.

625
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,416
This man, Kawashima,

626
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:12,625
has done everything
from being a mercenary to a killer.

627
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:14,666
A strange man.

628
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,875
He can change his appearance
depending on who he's with.

629
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:22,000
He's like a chameleon and is very elusive.

630
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:23,541
The "hide-and-seek" man.

631
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,833
There's something else I have to tell you.

632
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:36,416
Kinjo, your contact in Deigyo-gai...

633
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,416
got killed.

634
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:44,750
They asked him about you,
but he didn't tell them a thing.

635
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:51,083
How do you know that?

636
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:55,041
It's me who sold you out.

637
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,375
I see.

638
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,000
You're not angry?

639
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:12,083
It's your job to sell information.

640
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:18,666
In any case,
I'm supposed to go here, right?

641
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,708
Yes.

642
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:24,875
But they'll be expecting you.

643
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:26,458
It won't be easy.

644
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:31,125
As an ex-pro i-go player,
how do you see this battle?

645
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:34,541
The enemy has overwhelming advantage.

646
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:39,666
I would say you need a miraculous move
to turn things around.

647
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,041
Then, why side with me?

648
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:47,583
Because I was ousted from pro i-go
due to my gambling addiction.

649
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:28,000
Do you know who cut off my leg

650
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:30,875
so I wouldn't escape?

651
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:34,250
The villagers.

652
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:40,500
My parents didn't help me.

653
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:44,791
When the village was freed,

654
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:49,250
I killed my first victim.

655
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,291
It was...

656
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:56,541
my mother.

657
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:12,833
Stupid.

658
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,750
Really stupid.

659
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:17,666
Wait.

660
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,041
What happened?

661
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,625
Are you all right?

662
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,250
It'll be over soon.

663
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:33,916
-That's not what I'm...
-Soon.

664
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,708
All will be better soon.

665
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,083
It's already better enough for me.

666
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,916
I met you in this town.

667
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,125
Wait for me at your place.

668
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,208
You are...

669
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,583
me.

670
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:10,333
Jigen's here.

671
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,958
Koinobori will be his gravestone.

672
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:22,083
And this town...

673
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:27,375
will be known all over the underworld.

674
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,041
You're dead.

675
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,708
Bastard!

676
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:29,125
Damn!

677
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:50,875
Damn, this is endless.

678
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
He's here!

679
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:57,500
Good grief.

680
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:52,041
You all right?

681
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:58,416
Yeah. The shopping street
had a trip planned, but I wrecked the bus.

682
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,541
Everyone's gonna be mad at me.

683
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:03,750
Why are you here?

684
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,458
To deliver a watch I repaired.

685
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:12,916
You can start making memories
with this thing again.

686
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:24,583
This is a dangerous watch, eh?

687
01:35:25,958 --> 01:35:27,291
I beg you.

688
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:29,958
Oto's time has stopped still.

689
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:33,958
Move time forward for her.

690
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:30,208
He could've given me more freebies.

691
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:20,208
You're gonna beat me to death?

692
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,708
It's to kill you once and for all.

693
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,291
You're doing better than I thought.

694
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:37,458
I'm surprised
I haven't heard your name before.

695
01:41:38,833 --> 01:41:41,041
The more people I killed,

696
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:45,291
the more people mocked me
for being a coward.

697
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:49,416
What's more,

698
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:54,916
even my comrades found me creepy
and wanted me dead.

699
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:02,291
So, this is the first time
I get a compliment.

700
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,833
But there's one thing I can't forgive.

701
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:07,750
What's that?

702
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:12,125
You used the kid as a shield.

703
01:42:15,291 --> 01:42:17,791
I gotta go home!

704
01:42:27,458 --> 01:42:29,750
You finally shot.

705
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:34,750
Not many bullets left?

706
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:39,041
Two are more than enough.

707
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:41,875
Amazing.

708
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:44,083
What a cool guy.

709
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:48,333
But I wonder if you can see me.

710
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,583
Gotta go home.

711
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:30,500
She's waiting for me.

712
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,166
Gotta go home.

713
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Move ahead.

714
01:45:36,041 --> 01:45:37,125
Stop.

715
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:40,583
Aren't you gonna shoot me?

716
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,291
Not till you tell me where the kid is.

717
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:46,916
She's here.

718
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,583
Give her back to me.

719
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:58,583
I refuse.

720
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:09,375
I heard Jigen Daisuke
only used the Combat Magnum.

721
01:46:09,958 --> 01:46:12,083
Unfortunately,
my partner's out of bullets.

722
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:14,375
Besides, look at you.

723
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:17,541
You have no chance of winning.

724
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,041
Maybe.

725
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:29,625
I promise to give this girl
everything she wants.

726
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:34,291
I'll give her a life
that's safer and happier

727
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:38,416
than any she'll find
in the cruel outside world.

728
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:43,625
So, just turn around,

729
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:46,666
and get out of this town.

730
01:47:00,041 --> 01:47:03,583
I'm... sorry.

731
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:09,041
Oto.

732
01:47:22,416 --> 01:47:23,833
But you...

733
01:47:26,875 --> 01:47:28,708
can never make her laugh.

734
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:55,791
What are you doing?

735
01:47:56,750 --> 01:48:00,791
If you'd been there for me back then,

736
01:48:01,416 --> 01:48:03,500
would things have been different,

737
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:07,208
or the same?

738
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,166
I want to see.

739
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:13,041
I don't get it.

740
01:48:14,333 --> 01:48:15,208
So,

741
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,583
go back to being your true self,
Jigen Daisuke.

742
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:41,916
Any time.

743
01:48:44,666 --> 01:48:47,833
When she reaches the wall.

744
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:59,541
No!

745
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:37,958
Oto.

746
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:03,500
Let's go home.

747
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:10,333
YAGUCHI CLOCK STORE

748
01:51:10,416 --> 01:51:12,333
Hey, hello there.

749
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:13,875
You've grown a lot.

750
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:17,291
Hey, hello.

751
01:51:35,791 --> 01:51:38,541
Hey, you've been cooking nothing but meat.

752
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:41,666
You should have a more balanced diet.

753
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:45,375
Who are you to say? Your fridge is empty.

754
01:51:47,833 --> 01:51:48,750
There.

755
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:53,666
I want you to buy something.

756
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:55,583
What is it?

757
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:57,833
A family register.

758
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,166
You're gonna adopt her?

759
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:06,125
Yeah, if that's what she wants.

760
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,375
She'll be thrilled.

761
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:16,583
Can you still eat meat?

762
01:52:16,666 --> 01:52:18,541
Yes, my stomach is in its 20s.

763
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:20,833
You wish!

764
01:52:38,375 --> 01:52:39,750
Looks good on you.

765
01:52:44,166 --> 01:52:47,041
Food's gonna get cold. Come sit.

766
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:51,625
Let's eat.

767
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,166
Come.

768
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:57,416
Here.

769
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,625
I heard you got told off for noisy eating.

770
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,625
How embarrassing.

771
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,958
Things taste better this way.

772
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:18,375
Oto, don't become an adult like him.

773
01:53:22,458 --> 01:53:23,375
Oto.

774
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:30,541
Sukiyaki has sake in it, so don't eat it.

775
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:37,958
When you grow up,

776
01:53:40,583 --> 01:53:41,916
I'll make you some again.

777
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:12,625
I'M SORRY. IT'S MY FAULT.

778
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:16,625
THANK YOU.
I HAD SOBA NOODLES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

779
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:19,208
THE LADY THERE WAS KIND.
NOODLES WERE DELICIOUS.

780
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,333
I DON'T WANT THIS. I WANT THIS ONE.
THANK YOU.

781
01:55:26,666 --> 01:55:28,791
What a vacation that was...

782
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:49,541
Looks like I've a job in Japan.

783
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:08,541
THE STORY, CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
IN THIS MOTION PICTURE ARE FICTITIOUS.
