1
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,937
Raccoon, Raccoon
Come on out and play

2
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,441
I can't right now, I'm eating

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,443
What is it you're eating?

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,778
Pickled plums and radish

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,739
How about some for me?

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,908
Hey, don't be so greedy

7
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,468
We raccoons
have always lived near humans.

8
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,972
Not to steal their food. Not at all.

9
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,058
Where there are paddies and fields,

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,187
there are frogs and grasshoppers,
mice and moles.

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,439
There's fruit,
like persimmons and mulberries.

12
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,068
There's much more food than in the woods.

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,531
Last spring, the old farmhouse
was suddenly abandoned.

14
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:18,620
It looked like no one was coming back,
so we all moved in.

15
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:33,384
We spent a really wonderful year there.

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,180
Living in a house
with a garden was like a dream.

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,348
But then...

18
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:58,701
We raccoons usually don't make a fuss
over territory, but this was different.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,455
Wherever we went looking for food,
we ran into other raccoons.

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,834
There were quarrels,
and fights over burrows...

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,043
until one day...

22
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,506
Autumn, year 31 of the Pom Poko era.

23
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:15,510
On the newly logged border
between Taka and Suzu Woods,

24
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,514
the raccoons of Tama Hills
gathered for their final battle.

25
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,756
The red army was led by Gonta,
a fearsome raccoon from Taka.

26
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,344
The blue army was led by Seizaemon,
an elder from Suzu.

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,059
Now, it's a little-known fact,

28
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,396
but when humans aren't around,

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,026
raccoons walk on two legs,
just as you see here.

30
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,457
The battle was hard-fought,
but it did not last long.

31
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:16,381
Fight, fight! Taka!
Fight, fight! Suzu!

32
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,884
Red wins, blue wins
Both of you lose

33
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,387
Slaughter the losing raccoons

34
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:28,434
Taka loses today
Suzu loses tomorrow

35
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,396
The raccoons have nowhere to go

36
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,399
Where can the raccoons go to?

37
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,443
There's nowhere for them to go

38
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,822
Whether red wins or blue wins
Both sides lose

39
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,408
Kill the losing raccoons!

40
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,452
It's for the greater good

41
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
There are too many of them

42
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,000
Fewer raccoons is better for all

43
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,752
The rest of you, control yourselves

44
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,005
Stop having children

45
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,674
Have more children
And you'll lose everything

46
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,010
Your homes are disappearing
And that's a fact

47
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,599
Granny Oroku was right.

48
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,936
The raccoons were stunned
by the desolation around them.

49
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,105
Their woods were disappearing.

50
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,733
A chilling panorama of denuded,
flattened hills

51
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,277
stretched as far as the eye could see.

52
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,612
This is madness!

53
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,365
It's no time for us to be fighting!

54
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,205
In those days, Japan was entering
a golden age of economic growth.

55
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
Demand for housing around Tokyo exploded.

56
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,170
Lots of farmland and forest disappeared
in waves of uncontrolled development.

57
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:44,218
As Tokyo grew, it gnawed the land
in random patterns like a huge insect.

58
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,846
Then in 1967, the city fathers
hit on a better idea:

59
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,016
A plan for a new suburb of Tokyo
called Tama New Town.

60
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,605
Over 300,000 people would populate
an area of 3,000 hectares.

61
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,984
Forests would be cleared,
hills flattened, valleys filled,

62
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,362
farms and fields obliterated,
old farmhouses demolished.

63
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:08,701
Tama Hills would be transformed
into an enormous construction site

64
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,206
to create a model bedroom town
for Tokyo's workers.

65
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,375
It was the largest urban development
project in history.

66
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,131
You've got to hand it to these humans.
They're really something.

67
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,511
We always thought
they were animals just like us,

68
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,554
but now we know we were wrong.

69
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:34,393
They must be even more powerful
than the gods.

70
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,985
Raccoon clans from all over Tama Hills

71
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,573
gathered secretly late one night
at the old abandoned Manpuku Temple,

72
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,992
deep in the forest.

73
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,745
By unanimous agreement of all present,

74
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,081
the meeting was chaired by Tsurukame Osho,

75
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,333
the temple's 105-year-old
resident raccoon.

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,253
...so in view of the current difficulties,

77
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,007
we must abandon our nocturnal habits

78
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,846
and be prepared to act
at any time of the day or night.

79
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,013
Amid some confusion,

80
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,434
the assembly agreed
on a policy to stop the development.

81
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,646
That makes it unanimous!

82
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,358
The raccoons went home,

83
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,653
while the clan elders worked out
a specific course of action.

84
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,160
The elders settled on a five-year plan

85
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,829
to revive the neglected art
of shape-shifting

86
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,164
and study the ways of humans.

87
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,000
They invited
renowned shape-shifting practitioners

88
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,668
from Sado and Shikoku islands,

89
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,796
where the art was most advanced,
to teach the young raccoons.

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,839
YASHIIMA - SABURŌ

91
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,091
But in view of the difficulties

92
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,305
and danger posed by the long journeys
to fetch these teachers,

93
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,141
no one wanted to go.
So, they all pretended to fall asleep.

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,603
I suppose we'll just have to wait
for the youngsters

95
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,062
to acquire the skills on their own.

96
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,858
Agreed!

97
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,863
The McDonald's hamburgers
provided to fuel the discussion

98
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,366
were enthusiastically received.

99
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,411
And with that,
the council of elders concluded.

100
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,580
REVIVE SHAPE-SHIFTING
STUDY HUMANS

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,217
NO DUMPING

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,679
Keeping close track of human acitivity
was of the utmost importance,

103
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,724
so the raccoons decided
to set up a television set

104
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,353
in their headquarters,
the main hall of Manpuku Temple.

105
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,405
- Good evening.
-Good evening!

106
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,409
The arrival of the television
provoked great interest.

107
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,417
The headquarters at Manpuku Temple
were soon crowded with visitors

108
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,088
who were there just to spend the day
watching television.

109
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,885
Shape-shifting requires the highest
degree of mental concentration.

110
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,265
It means changing
one's very cells in an instant.

111
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,059
Truly, this is nature's greatest miracle.

112
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:25,856
Lesser forms of transformation can be
achieved by such animals as chameleons.

113
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,237
But only raccoons, foxes and some
old cats can practice real shape-shifting.

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,572
YIN YANG
SHAPE-SHIFTING

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,740
Gonta!

116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,452
That you can assume
such an appearance, even for a moment,

117
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,040
proves you've taken the first steps on
the path, whether you realise it or not.

118
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,960
If one studies hard and grasps the basics,

119
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,047
any raccoon can learn to shape-shift.
At least in theory.

120
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,386
Allow me to demonstrate!

121
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,098
Aren't you going to put a leaf
on your head?

122
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,017
That's for beginners!

123
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,193
It's been a long time!

124
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,988
And a one, and a two!

125
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,450
With Granny Oroku as their instructor,

126
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,328
the raccoons made steady progress
in the art of shape-shifting.

127
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,584
Young raccoons from every clan burned
with desire to hone their skills.

128
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,920
Bravo, Shokichi!

129
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,762
-Gotcha!
-Gotcha!

130
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,513
Gotcha!

131
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,811
I've been interested in humans
and their ways ever since I was a child.

132
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,232
As a rule we weren't supposed
to approach them,

133
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,903
but for my late father, I think that
just sharpened his interest.

134
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,574
Careful observation of humans is
a basic requirement for shape-shifting,

135
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,078
so I'm sure he thought getting close
to them would prove useful.

136
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,768
It goes without saying that some
of our raccoons were not good students.

137
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,647
In fact, many of them
simply couldn't manage at all.

138
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,697
Shape-shifting requires rigorous
physical and mental discipline.

139
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,159
Naturally this discouraged
many of the raccoons,

140
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,287
who unlike foxes,
are inclined to be rather lazy.

141
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,667
Hey!

142
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,383
Ponkichi!

143
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,719
All the arhats are here
Turn them

144
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,805
Turn, turn, turn, turn

145
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,391
Back then all I thought about
was shape-shifting.

146
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,643
I never dreamed my childhood pal Ponkichi

147
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,897
wanted nothing more than to live
like a normal raccoon.

148
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,319
...so when the traveler
reached the mountain pass,

149
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,322
he saw the pine tree

150
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,618
seemed to have grown an extra branch.

151
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,537
Now, this was odd.

152
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,499
The traveler said to himself, "There was
no branch on that side last time."

153
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,379
And lo and behold!
The branch switched sides.

154
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,633
Seeing this, the traveler said aloud,

155
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,761
"That's not right either.
There were branches on both sides."

156
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,931
And sure enough,
branches sprouted on both sides.

157
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,766
The next instant, boom!

158
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,062
Something fell!
What was it, do you suppose?

159
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,355
A raccoon!

160
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,984
Right! And why did he fall? Gonta?

161
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,362
He was a klutz. I'd never fall.

162
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:06,202
That's the spirit!
Sasuke, why do you think he fell?

163
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,205
He had to let go of the tree
to make two branches.

164
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:14,210
Very good! And what is the moral
of this story? Shokichi?

165
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,255
It doesn't pay to take
what humans say literally.

166
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,718
That's correct.
We raccoons are naturally good-natured.

167
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,679
We get carried away!
We try too hard to please!

168
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,391
This is where we go wrong. Do you see?

169
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,976
Yes, Tsurukame Osho!

170
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:38,234
So if I were to say: "Mr. Raccoon,
Mr. Raccoon, come out and play"?

171
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,363
We're in the middle of a lesson now!

172
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:47,368
See? You're already getting carried away!
This is what worries me!

173
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:08,430
As the raccoons worked to understand
humans and practice shape-shifting,

174
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
winter turned to spring.

175
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,935
The plum trees blossomed,
and love was in the air.

176
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,648
But most raccoons heeded
Granny Oroku's order to remain chaste

177
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:23,529
and to avoid having children
until everyone's homes were safe again.

178
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,659
They suppressed their maternal instincts

179
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,997
and firmly rejected
the males' clumsy efforts to woo them.

180
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,506
Meanwhile, the massive
development project was picking up steam.

181
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,508
Woods were cleared, the earth was scoured,

182
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,343
and construction sites multiplied.

183
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,179
The raccoons,
filled with anger and sadness,

184
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,974
called these sites "bald hills."

185
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,396
Mr. Postman, you dropped something

186
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,567
Freed from the work of child-rearing,

187
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,654
some of the females
started to practice shape-shifting too.

188
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,700
When males tried to pass themselves
off as women or children,

189
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,994
the overall effect was not quite right.

190
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,997
With the participation of the females,
this problem was solved.

191
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,169
Naturally, some of the females wanted
to try their hand at turning into males.

192
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,927
Ah, I'd like the males
to stay after class today.

193
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:34,391
One day, Tsurukame Osho
gave a special lecture for the males.

194
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,066
Now then, what do you think
the carpet you are all sitting on is?

195
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,986
I may as well tell you. It's my testicles!

196
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:51,116
It's exactly eight mats.
And I'll prove it!

197
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,549
The time finally came for the students
to test their skills in the real world.

198
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,845
The exercise was conducted
like a driving lesson.

199
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,432
Each student was accompanied
by an advanced partner,

200
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,561
in case of unforeseen problems
or someone seeing through their disguise.

201
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,596
Shape-shifting requires
large amounts of energy,

202
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,307
especially when assuming human form.

203
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,645
The dark circles
raccoons have around their eyes

204
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,233
are the result of sheer fatigue.

205
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,652
Even experienced shape-shifters

206
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,655
have to secretly carry special herbs

207
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,158
to replenish their strength
at a moment's notice.

208
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,035
Otherwise, out pops the tail,

209
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,580
and the next thing you know,
they're back to their original form.

210
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,250
Recently raccoons have discovered

211
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:28,380
that instant energy drinks widely sold
in stores are a good pick-me-up.

212
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,593
To graduate
from the shape-shifting course,

213
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,970
students had to pass one final test:

214
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,682
they had to go out and earn
at least 1,000 yen through honest labor.

215
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,601
Help!

216
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,438
Some raccoons got together and took turns
impersonating the same human.

217
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,689
Are you all right?

218
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,151
Others transformed themselves
into monks with begging bowls.

219
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:54,198
Some females worked in clubs and raked in
money drinking with customers.

220
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,160
Another raccoon won a fortune
at the pachinko parlor.

221
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,078
COLLECTION BOX

222
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,997
One tricky raccoon
burgled a temple donation box,

223
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,791
but all he got was small change.

224
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,045
So he transformed some leaves into bills,
but Oroku saw right through him.

225
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,468
I told you modern shape-shifting
forbids turning leaves into money!

226
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,270
One day, an urgent report interrupted
Gonta's training at headquarters.

227
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,066
He hurried home
to Taka Woods to face tragedy.

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,863
More than half his childhood home
had already been ravaged by construction.

229
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,076
Gonta went mad with grief.

230
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,203
He raced back to headquarters

231
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,248
and forced Tsurukame Osho
to call a meeting of the clan elders,

232
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,459
where he called for a strategy
of violent attacks on the humans.

233
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,255
-I'm completely against this.
-Why?

234
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,342
The time is not ripe. We're still
in the first year of the Five-Year Plan.

235
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,596
We've all completed our training.
There's a lot we can do right now!

236
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:05,853
What do you think, Granny? Do you think
these youngsters are up to it?

237
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,523
True, they've mastered the basics, but...

238
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,108
But?

239
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:16,697
They lack experience.
One slip and they'll be exposed.

240
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,448
Gonta, I have to ask you this.

241
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,451
I think your anger at what happened
to Taka Woods

242
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,664
is clouding your judgment.

243
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,874
Isn't that so?

244
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,627
I swear there is
absolutely no truth to that.

245
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,882
I'm thinking of the welfare
of all the raccoons of Tama.

246
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,843
What do you mean, everyone's welfare?

247
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,848
Don't forget, Gonta's the one
who tried to take over Suzu Woods!

248
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,932
Shut up!

249
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,936
Even if no one's for it, we raccoons
of Taka are going ahead anyway.

250
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,106
If Gonta's that determined,
I'm going to help him!

251
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,983
You too, Shokichi?

252
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,818
Thank you!

253
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,240
It's too late to stop us now!

254
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,326
Not so fast!

255
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,120
Don't try to stop us, Granny!

256
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,750
Just this once,
I'll teach you a special technique!

257
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,631
If you bungle this,

258
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,134
you won't return to your original form
for five days.

259
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,929
So, what is it?

260
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,182
A dead fox!

261
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,351
Summer, year 32 of the Pom Poko era.

262
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,605
Ten young volunteers
led by Gonta of Taka Woods

263
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,191
set out to apply
their new skills in shape-shifting

264
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,653
with a series of desperate
surprise attacks on the humans.

265
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,781
The raccoons were fighting back at last.

266
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,712
-Here they come!
-They're coming!

267
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,971
Keep going! Keep going!

268
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,186
We did it!

269
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,900
Multiple accidents at construction site.

270
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,571
Disaster struck Tama New Town
development site at approximately 2:30 pm.

271
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:07,576
A series of landslides and accidents
killed three workers, injured two,

272
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,997
and destroyed
a residence under construction.

273
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,081
LIVE

274
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,669
Police suspect reduced visibility
and unstable ground from heavy rains.

275
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:23,759
The widespread, simultaneous nature
of the accidents is raising concern.

276
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,762
There may be fundamental flaws
with the development plan.

277
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:32,809
Some local residents
are calling for a review of the plan.

278
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,231
Hold on, everyone!

279
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,525
I think we should take a moment

280
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,404
to remember the poor humans

281
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,783
who died in this operation.

282
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,202
Osho is right.

283
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:56,291
Let's observe a minute of silent prayer
for the unfortunate victims.

284
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,294
Agreed! A minute of silence!

285
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,921
All pray!

286
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,468
Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha,

287
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,929
Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha...

288
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,442
What a success!

289
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,225
Look, it's Gonta!

290
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,271
The heroes have returned!

291
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,235
You really did it, Shokichi!

292
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:12,868
You youngsters have restored hope
in this old heart of mine.

293
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,621
That was only the beginning!
Today was just a practice run!

294
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,292
Raccoons, the war has started!

295
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:25,589
We must kill, crush,
and mangle every human we can,

296
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,091
until they are driven from Tama Hills!

297
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,594
Shokichi, you should say something too!

298
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,345
And let's plant trees!

299
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,641
Lots and lots
of our favorite persimmon trees!

300
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,313
Little persimmon seeds
Send out your shoots

301
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,108
We'll have all the persimmons we can eat

302
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,485
Out with the humans!

303
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,030
Slaughter the humans!

304
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:55,869
Okay, okay, okay. But first,
we must celebrate this auspicious victory.

305
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,872
You know, something worries me.

306
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,832
What?

307
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,252
Are we really going to drive out
all the humans?

308
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,879
Of course!

309
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,882
Can't we let a few of them stay,
the way it used to be?

310
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,302
No way!
The two-legs are our sworn enemies.

311
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,388
They're vermin. We've got to get rid
of them once and for all!

312
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:20,685
I see. I mean, look, I hate humans too.

313
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:27,484
Well, some of them are not so bad.
I mean, I really do hate them. But...

314
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,069
But what?

315
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:35,033
But if we get rid of them all,
we'll never eat tempura again!

316
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,577
Or sardines!

317
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,704
Or corn!

318
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:46,378
Hamburgers! Donuts! Fried chicken!
Potato chips! Pizza!

319
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,463
I can taste it!

320
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,969
Well then, Gonta, shall we let
a few of the humans stay?

321
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
I guess it can't be helped.

322
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,351
Hooray for Gon! Lift him up, fellows!

323
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:07,357
The moon, moon, moon shines bright

324
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:13,822
Over Man-Man-Manpuku Temple

325
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,492
All our friends are here tonight
Pun Poko pun pun, pun pun

326
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,161
We'll show the world
What Tsurukame Osho can do

327
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,706
Come on, come on
All our friends are here tonight

328
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,085
Come on, come on
All our friends are here tonight

329
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,837
A government spokesman stressed

330
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,924
that the project is an urgent necessity
for the people of Tokyo,

331
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,428
and that today's accidents will not affect

332
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,682
the government's determination
to carry out the construction.

333
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,434
What?

334
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,605
It was a very unfortunate accident.

335
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,776
Poor Gonta,
the driving force behind the attacks,

336
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:57,032
suffered fractures and internal injuries
that would take a year to heal.

337
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,408
Gonta!

338
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,998
The news report plunged
the raccoons into depression.

339
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,127
But when the news began to cover
the locals' fears of divine retribution,

340
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,297
their spirits soared again.

341
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:17,469
Maybe it was a mistake,
moving that Shinto shrine.

342
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,471
What do you mean?

343
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:24,184
Maybe all these incidents are revenge
from the gods of the shrine.

344
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,355
It's true that a lot of Jizo statues
and shrines have been moved.

345
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,982
Yes, that really worried me.

346
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,651
I asked the developers to observe
the proper ceremonies

347
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,779
before moving them, but...

348
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,239
Professor Mizuki,
what do you think about all this?

349
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:44,454
These spirits are usually associated
with a given location.

350
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:50,126
If their abodes are moved,
they'll try to return home.

351
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,422
If they do, and everything has changed,
they naturally become upset.

352
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,468
I have a feeling
there's a lot more trouble to come.

353
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,722
Maybe I can save my woods after all.

354
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,562
Shokichi and the others went into action.

355
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,280
The owner of Shokichi's woods
came to inspect his property

356
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,200
with one of the developers
before construction began.

357
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,245
To his surprise, he saw far more
Jizo statues than he remembered.

358
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,249
"I'd better give this more thought,"
he told the developer,

359
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,709
and he held off on signing
the contract to sell his land.

360
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,964
During a ceremony at another shrine
that was slated to be moved,

361
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:43,304
one of the raccoons suddenly appeared
on the roof disguised as a fox,

362
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,807
the shrine's servant to the gods.

363
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,439
The fox's eerie cry brought the
proceedings to an immediate halt.

364
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,942
The ceremony was cancelled,
the shrine's relocation put on hold,

365
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,153
and residents petitioned the authorities

366
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,239
to change plans for a road
through the area.

367
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,993
The raccoons were on a roll.

368
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:19,007
Each group tried to outdo the others

369
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,593
in a campaign of guerrilla operations.

370
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,220
Come this way!

371
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,392
Go away!

372
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,272
Take it with you!

373
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,652
Let's take all the trash
and leftovers with us.

374
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,446
The leftovers!

375
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,115
Leave them behind!

376
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,289
Is something wrong, miss?

377
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,630
What's the trouble?

378
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,142
I have no face!

379
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,188
A specter!

380
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,057
-J-j-just now, I... I saw--
-A murder?

381
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,059
N-no, it was...

382
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,770
Not a murder? Too bad!

383
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,607
Th-th-there was a woman!

384
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:04,153
-Did she have a mouth like a shark?
-No! No! She was... I mean...

385
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,157
Then, was she something like this?

386
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,910
It's her!

387
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:31,598
Was... she... something... like... this?

388
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,943
The raccoons took endless delight
in frightening the humans.

389
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,947
After every big success,
they held a celebration.

390
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,204
But Gonta, the one who started it all,

391
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,416
showed no signs of recovering
from his injuries.

392
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,960
His loving wife Otama
cared for him tenderly,

393
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,422
but she could not soothe his frustration
at being out of the fight.

394
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,259
Frankly, Gonta thought
his raccoon friends were wimps.

395
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,262
Yesterday's  News Train  was priceless.

396
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,932
You know that special
about "Tama New Specter Town"?

397
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,893
They interviewed the cop we scared.

398
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:22,774
The other guests laughed in his face.
He was so furious! I almost died!

399
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,986
Idiot! So what?
Are they going to stop the project

400
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,363
just because of stuff like that?

401
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,698
If you're going to shape-shift,
do it the way I did!

402
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,744
Cause accidents, and kill them!

403
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,665
-Oh, no!
-Gonta!

404
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,250
It was just as Gonta said.

405
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,211
The project didn't stop.

406
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:49,217
Rivers were encased in concrete,
roads were laid out everywhere,

407
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,760
masses of building material flowed in,

408
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,930
and the construction of thousands of
apartments finally got under way.

409
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,059
The strange happenings
on the construction sites

410
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,268
and in the hills

411
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:04,565
received nationwide coverage.

412
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,777
The raccoons were gaining
confidence in their ultimate victory.

413
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,782
Rock, paper, scissors...

414
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,788
Autumn, year 32 of the Pom Poko era.

415
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,583
It was time to choose messengers
to travel to Sade and Shikoku islands

416
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,919
to seek help
from famous shape-shifting masters.

417
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,799
Tamasaburo of Oni Woods
was chosen to go to Shikoku.

418
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,845
Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh
was chosen to travel to Sado.

419
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,684
So at the next full moon,

420
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:44,564
the two young raccoons
said farewell to their comrades

421
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,859
and set out for their destinations
in high spirits.

422
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,041
What a smell!

423
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:10,339
The raccoons continued
haunting the construction sites.

424
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,224
They were having so much fun
with their shape-shifting,

425
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,479
they almost didn't care
whether it was effective or not.

426
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,120
-Out with the demons!
-Daddy!

427
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,274
Will this really drive out the humans?

428
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,905
Won't they see through us
one of these days?

429
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,743
Maybe we should really go after them,
like Gonta says.

430
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:26,457
What does it matter
if one or two get killed?

431
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:32,755
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."

432
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,475
Kiyo!

433
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,481
What are you doing up there?

434
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
Something wrong with your neck?

435
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,118
I was posing for you.
I was hoping you'd say I was pretty.

436
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,619
Oh, sorry.

437
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,622
Now there really is something wrong
with my neck.

438
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,583
You looked pretty.

439
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,834
It's too late.

440
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,669
I mean it.

441
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,466
It's okay. I just need more practice.

442
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,188
One day a raccoon from Potamochi Mountain

443
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,442
Everyone likes that song, don't they?
I kind of like it myself.

444
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,153
Do you know the song,
"Where Are You From?"

445
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,530
Yes, but I can't sing all the lyrics.

446
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,740
That song used to be--

447
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:46,954
There was a raccoon from Senba
Along came a hunter

448
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,582
A hunter shot my grandpa.

449
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,085
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

450
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:58,799
That's okay.
But Grandpa wasn't boiled or fried.

451
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,803
Someone paid a lot for his pelt.

452
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,097
I really like your fur too.

453
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,476
Why, that makes me happy.
Coming from you, that is.

454
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,523
So, what were you going to say
about that song?

455
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,903
My father used to sing it.

456
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,529
He was a good ball-bouncer too.

457
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,366
He must have been a character.

458
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:29,455
Whenever he got to the end of the song,
he always warned us.

459
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,332
About what?

460
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,126
"You kids better remember:

461
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,796
"Even in a simple ball-bouncing song,

462
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,215
"you hear about the cruel nature
of humans."

463
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:44,136
"How they hunt us raccoons, kill us
and eat us. And don't you forget it!"

464
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,309
Say, shall we bounce balls?

465
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,144
Are you good at it?

466
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,771
Yes, I'm pretty good.

467
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,695
Then I better do my best too!

468
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,997
Where are you from? Higo
Where's Higo?

469
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:15,751
In Kumamoto
Where's Kumamoto? In Semba

470
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,630
There was a raccoon from Semba

471
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,923
Along came--

472
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,927
Shokichi, when are you going to do
that "Operation Twin Star" you mentioned?

473
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,596
Oh, I don't really want to do it anymore.

474
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,141
But it was such a good plan.

475
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,853
Why don't we do it tonight?
Just the two of us.

476
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,604
With you?

477
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,982
Are you afraid to do it with me?

478
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,485
No, it's not that. It's just...

479
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,656
Then let's try.
I'm sure it will go over really well.

480
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:50,286
Okay, let's do it! With you as my partner,
I bet things will go great.

481
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,288
I can't wait!

482
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,926
Well, well, what adorable little children!

483
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:11,557
We just got back from a trip
to the stars, but our home is gone.

484
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,559
A trip to the stars?

485
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:19,023
From red-eyed Scorpio
to the Eagle's wings...

486
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,694
From the coils of the Snake
to the brow of the Bear Cub!

487
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:29,241
We sprinkle the dew and frost
as we fly among the stars.

488
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,786
What is this?

489
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,500
Our home is gone! We're cold!

490
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,586
Mister, do you know where our home went?

491
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,299
Your home? I don't know what you mean.

492
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,803
Nobody knows! Run along now!

493
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,347
We should call the police.
Someone get the police here!

494
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,479
Hey, what are you kids doing?

495
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,161
They're not kids, they're spirits!

496
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,371
Spirits?

497
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:19,250
Little spirits, please don't be angry!

498
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,648
Now, just hold on a minute.

499
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,193
I'll treat you right! You want a raise?
Come on, give me a break!

500
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:53,117
No, I've had it. I'm going back home.
I can't stay in these haunted hills.

501
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,911
Come on, Suzuki.

502
00:40:56,078 --> 00:41:01,208
I heard Tokyo was a scary place,
but this is too much for me.

503
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,586
You'd better stop the construction.

504
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,379
Whether it's gods or devils,

505
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,965
somebody or something
is really upset about this project.

506
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,391
The raccoons cheered.

507
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,020
That evening's celebrations
were especially grand.

508
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,066
Naturally, the guests of honor
were the two heroes, Kiyo and Shokichi.

509
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:36,202
Meanwhile, the workers' quarters
were dark and silent.

510
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,954
But the next morning...

511
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,751
It seemed there was
an endless supply of humans.

512
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,587
No matter how many
the raccoons scared away,

513
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,882
there were always others
to take their place.

514
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,385
It's rumored among local residents

515
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,430
that this may be
the work of foxes and raccoons.

516
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,975
That would make things simple enough.

517
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,188
All we'd have to do is
exterminate all the offending animals.

518
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,191
The raccoons who were watching
were shocked.

519
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,571
But these incidents
are right out of old folk tales.

520
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,574
It's not surprising people think
foxes and raccoons are behind it.

521
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:20,204
But that is precisely the proof
that this is all just malicious rumors.

522
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,207
What do you mean, rumors?
I saw it with my own eyes!

523
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,708
Oh, all right.

524
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,214
In that case, we'll issue
an extermination order for these pests.

525
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,551
As soon as you find
any more raccoons playing more tricks,

526
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,094
let us know immediately.

527
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,430
That is, if you can prove it!

528
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,061
Shokichi was not the only one
who wondered

529
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,689
whether shape-shifting was enough
to drive out the humans.

530
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,568
As you all know, the Edo period
was a golden age for raccoons.

531
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,446
Raccoon shape-shifting was

532
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,909
a frequent
subject for painters and writers.

533
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,663
But unfortunately,
we raccoons were too conspicuous.

534
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,915
We aroused the resentment of humans.

535
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:10,879
In the modern era,
we've been hunted for our pelts,

536
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,216
and our fur has been used
for paintbrushes and toothbrushes.

537
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,928
That's how the humans
took revenge for our excesses.

538
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,347
Don't any of you ever forget:

539
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,475
the past few decades
have been peaceful for us raccoons

540
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,103
only because we've exercised restraint

541
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:32,860
and not used shape-shifting too often.

542
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,280
Our talents are a two-edged sword.

543
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,575
I want all of you to use this technique
with discretion.

544
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,372
Otherwise, we'll invite
further retribution from the humans.

545
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:53,464
Oroku's speech dashed cold water
on the spirits of the young raccoons.

546
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,509
And now autumn was upon them,

547
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,721
the time of year when raccoons
need enough food to store ample fat

548
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:05,225
and grow the long, fluffy coats
needed for the coming winter.

549
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,953
The young raccoons focused their
attention and shape-shifting skills

550
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,665
on getting food for the winter.

551
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:36,131
One day, an exhausted raccoon
arrived in Tama Hills.

552
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,734
Don't worry, we're raccoons too!

553
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,740
Thank you very much.

554
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:08,330
You seem completely worn out.
Where did you come from?

555
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,915
From Fujino Woods.

556
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,750
Is that on Shikoku island? Sado island?

557
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,754
Why, no.
It's just over the mountains from here.

558
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,634
Just over the mountains?
So you're not from Shikoku after all.

559
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,098
Oh, my, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

560
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,309
No, it's just that we've been waiting
for someone from there.

561
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:33,647
So, what brought you here?

562
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:38,277
Now I finally know
where all that dirt is coming from,

563
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,903
the dirt that's ruining our woods!

564
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,991
According to this raccoon named Hayashi,

565
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:49,538
a huge amount of excavated dirt was
being illegally dumped in Fujino Woods.

566
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,041
The streams were polluted,
there were frequent landslides,

567
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,546
and the raccoons and other animals
of the woods were in dire straits.

568
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,676
To find out where all this
discarded earth was coming from,

569
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:07,723
Hayashi assumed human form and caught
a ride on one of the dump trucks.

570
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,232
Unfortunately,

571
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,360
shape-shifting
was not one of his strong points.

572
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,198
The swaying of the truck and the stress
of the journey made him fall asleep,

573
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,533
and he changed back into a raccoon.

574
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:30,245
It's not just Fujino Woods.
Other woods are being ruined too.

575
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,166
And now there are garbage dumps
and golf courses all over the place.

576
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,045
Our Tama Hills are levelled,
and we suffer.

577
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:43,258
Then the dirt is dumped in Fujino Woods,
and you suffer.

578
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,802
When will this insanity end?

579
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,058
And I was so astonished
at what I found here!

580
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,812
I thought the trucks came
from some site in the middle of Tokyo.

581
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,357
But we're in the hills here!

582
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,943
They dig up one hill
and dump it on another!

583
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,947
I just can't understand
why the humans are doing this.

584
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,451
So if we stop the construction,

585
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,829
it will help the raccoons
in Fujino Woods too, right?

586
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,917
What stirring words!

587
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,711
I beg you all to use
your skills in shape-shifting

588
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:25,592
to save our woods too!

589
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:31,139
Well, you see,
it's not really that simple, even for us.

590
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:39,314
Where could Bunta and Tamasaburo be?

591
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,734
They were supposed to go
and fetch the masters to help us.

592
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:50,826
There was no word from Shikoku or Sade.

593
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,161
And so winter came to Tama Hills.

594
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,832
With the raccoons down for the winter,

595
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,835
the haunting of Tama New Town
was forgotten,

596
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,671
and media attention evaporated.

597
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,674
The papers were filled with stories
about celebrity scandals

598
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,635
and sordid political goings-on.

599
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,394
Sleet covers the garden of Manpuku Temple

600
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,315
The sleet's like ice cream

601
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,944
All our friends are here
Pom Poko pun pun, pun pun

602
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,072
New Year's Day,
year 33 of the Pom Poko era.

603
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,660
Tama Hills greeted the new year
under a rare blanket of snow.

604
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,791
Most of the construction workers
had already returned to their hometowns

605
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:45,088
and were enjoying the holidays
surrounded by their families.

606
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:50,510
Push! Push! Push!

607
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,606
Our golden balls swing and swing

608
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,526
Though there's not a breath of wind

609
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,822
The baby raccoon sees our balls

610
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,534
And swings his--

611
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,662
We saw it! It really happened!

612
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,373
A bunch of raccoons pushed
that bulldozer over the cliff!

613
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,540
We're not lying!

614
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,628
Police suspect the workers, who stayed
behind over the new year holidays,

615
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:29,800
were inspired by the numerous pranks
that finally stopped last autumn.

616
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,551
However, snow
around the crime scene has melted,

617
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,429
and it may be difficult
to gather evidence.

618
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,556
I hope you know what you're doing,
Shokichi.

619
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,226
Oh, I think we'll be all right.

620
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,395
What a stupid prank.

621
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,354
Not at all.

622
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,233
Shokichi was trying to encourage
the raccoons who can't shape-shift

623
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,526
by giving them a way to help.

624
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,528
What do you think, Osho?

625
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:53,323
Hmm, I don't see any great harm done.

626
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,826
It was just as Osho predicted.

627
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,788
The three workers were released
for lack of evidence.

628
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,958
Naturally, no one believed the raccoons
were responsible.

629
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,835
The case remained unsolved.

630
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,638
And so spring came.

631
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,893
The season of love had arrived once again

632
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,689
The raccoons had been chaste
for more than a year,

633
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,566
and couldn't control themselves
any longer.

634
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:33,155
The air was filled with sweet nothings,
and the raccoons pursued

635
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,199
and wooed each other
until the very skies turned rosy.

636
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,289
Hanako! Wait!

637
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,464
Hanako!

638
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,383
You're walking much better!

639
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,138
Hanako! Wait just a minute!

640
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,724
Can't you catch me?

641
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,604
Everyone has spring fever.

642
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,648
I guess we're all
like the flowers and the trees.

643
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,068
When winter ends
and the sun shines down on us,

644
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,945
we can't help sending out shoots.

645
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,949
Then at last we blossom and bear fruit.

646
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:23,663
But we have to keep our promise to Granny.

647
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,001
Let's stay chaste
until we've finally won this war.

648
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:33,173
Shokichi, you're so wonderful.

649
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,675
I'm so happy!

650
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,472
Our love will last forever!

651
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,725
Shokichi!

652
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,109
That was a mistake.

653
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,362
Their love grew passionate,

654
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,697
and later that year,

655
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:03,703
four charming young raccoons
were born to Kiyo and Shokichi.

656
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,222
KINCHO DAIMYO SHRINE

657
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,891
Now, the previous autumn,

658
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,144
Tamasaburo had managed to reach
the island of Shikoku

659
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,106
after many trials and hardships.

660
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,152
He presented his request for help
to the shape-shifting master Kincho VI,

661
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,905
but then he collapsed
and was very ill for many weeks.

662
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,825
Luckily, Kincho had a daughter, Koharu,
who stayed by Tamasaburo's bedside

663
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,785
and miraculously
nursed him back to health.

664
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,163
With the coming of spring,
their bond deepened,

665
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,333
and Koharu bore Tamasaburo three cubs.

666
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:41,927
The island's elders held a council
in the inner chambers of the shrine.

667
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,430
They all agreed that stopping
Tama New Town's development

668
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:51,061
would send a message
to similar development projects

669
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,730
all over Japan.

670
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,691
But the elders were divided
as to who to send,

671
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,693
how affairs in Shikoku would be handled,

672
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,655
and how to avoid any succession disputes
that might arise

673
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,699
in case something should happen
to one of the participants.

674
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,203
Hundreds of questions were raised,
but no conclusions were reached.

675
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:15,001
It's such beautiful weather. But Father
and the others just talk, talk, talk.

676
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,089
They've been debating for six months now.

677
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,634
When will they ever reach a decision?

678
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,097
Oh, I hope they never reach a decision!

679
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,771
Tamasaburo, just the thought
that you might someday return

680
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:41,820
to far-off Tama Hills
makes my heart ache with sadness.

681
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:52,122
Koharu... I too dream
that our happiness never ends.

682
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,791
Why must it be just a dream?

683
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:01,006
I'll ask Father.

684
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:05,510
I'll ask him to let you stay here
and be his successor.

685
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,902
While Tamasaburo was struggling
to make a decision,

686
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:28,408
Bunta of Mizunomi Marsh roamed
the fields and mountains of Sade island,

687
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,452
searching for Danzaburo,

688
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,746
a shape-shifting master.

689
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:39,836
But he couldn't find anyone who knew
anything about the master's whereabouts.

690
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,511
During the summer and autumn of that year,

691
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,514
the raccoons of Tama Hills
were beset by a series of misfortunes.

692
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:55,393
Their woods continued to shrink
before the onslaught of development.

693
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:59,731
And just when the baby boom of spring
had brought many new mouths to feed,

694
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:04,986
poor summer weather
created a serious food shortage.

695
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,324
There were not nearly enough chestnuts
and persimmons to eat that autumn.

696
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,451
Those with shape-shifting skills
tried to help

697
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,204
by gathering food meant for humans,

698
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,499
but it was still not nearly enough
to feed the growing cubs.

699
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,263
Finally, even raccoons
who could not shape-shift

700
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,642
were forced to come out of the woods
and scavenge around human homes,

701
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,394
looking for anything
to feed their children.

702
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,398
Inevitably, some of them
began to lose their lives

703
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:47,362
on the roads and in traps.

704
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,316
I can't take any more!

705
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,779
The time has come for each of us
to take at least one human life,

706
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,030
even if we lose our own.

707
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,075
Are you sure you're all right now, Gonta?

708
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,203
Of course! See? I'm in the pink!

709
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:50,175
This is wonderful.
When should we celebrate your recovery?

710
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,888
This isn't the time for parties, Granny.

711
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,017
I think we should wait for the masters
of shape-shifting to get here

712
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,311
before we decide our strategy.

713
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:05,148
You too, Shokichi?
You're too young to be such a coward.

714
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,901
You're wrong.
We can't underestimate the humans.

715
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,196
If we attack them head on,
they'll destroy us.

716
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,115
We've waited long enough!

717
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,619
Be patient. Let's hear Shokichi out.

718
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,248
I propose we adopt three policies
until the masters arrive.

719
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:26,878
One: establish a system to hand out
food to raccoons who can't shape-shift.

720
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,130
In other words, a rationing system.

721
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,676
Two: thorough training in traffic safety.

722
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:39,641
Three: the creation of rescue squads
for raccoons caught in traps.

723
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,017
That's my proposal.

724
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,856
Shokichi, you're practically
like one of the humans.

725
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,109
No! I'm a raccoon, born and bred.

726
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:57,242
Well then, leaving the particulars
to later. All in favor?

727
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,452
Hands up!

728
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,079
In favor!

729
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,041
What is this nonsense, Gonta?

730
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,085
It's not nonsense! It's a coup d'état!

731
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,839
Anyone who opposes me from now on
will be killed by my private guard!

732
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,175
-Got it?
-Yeah!

733
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,428
Those are dangerous words, Gonta.

734
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,098
That's "Sir Gon."

735
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,227
Raccoons!
We all know the humans are dangerous.

736
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,355
If we attack without concern
for our own safety, victory will be ours.

737
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:32,652
They can be killed. As the saying goes,
"a trapped mouse will beat the cat."

738
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,655
What's that supposed to mean?

739
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,240
He doesn't look like a mouse.

740
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,659
He means we can win if we're desperate.

741
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:44,664
Exactly. If a mouse is cornered,
it'll find the strength to beat the cat.

742
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,292
We're not mice, Gonta.

743
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,419
What's the point in beating a cat?

744
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,924
Come to think of it, it's been a while
since I had a nice mouse.

745
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,801
Mouse tempura can't be beat.

746
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,887
No, deep fried is the tastiest!

747
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,808
Are you sure? I think the tempura batter
really makes it work.

748
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,145
That crispy deep-fried tail!

749
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,692
What the hell are you talking about!?

750
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:18,489
What's important is
I love mouse tempura! Yes, I do!

751
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,243
See Gonta? All we can think about is food.

752
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,123
I think we'd better wait for the masters
to get here.

753
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,627
My apologies.

754
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,379
I suppose it was too much

755
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,259
to expect the young raccoons
to stay chaste and not have babies.

756
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,677
No!

757
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:44,098
Instead of fewer raccoons,
we need fewer humans!

758
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:48,811
The places they've infested
used to be our homes!

759
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:53,024
The humans are the intruders!
Drive them out!

760
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,609
Kill them!

761
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:59,155
Drive them out! Kill them!

762
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,366
But at that very moment...

763
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,383
Hey, taxi!

764
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,291
I'll tell everyone you're here!

765
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,346
Tamasaburo!

766
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,849
I've brought the masters from Shikoku!

767
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,354
Tamasaburo! You did it!

768
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:28,494
Friends, on our way here,
we saw your devastated woods.

769
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,580
You have our deepest sympathy.

770
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:36,085
We'd like to address all raccoons
tonight. There's no time to lose.

771
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,130
Year 33 of the Pom Poko era, autumn.

772
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,426
All the raccoons assembled to welcome
the three masters from Shikoku.

773
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,640
There's a good moon out tonight.

774
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:55,229
Fellow raccoons,
I am Tazaburo Hage of Yashima.

775
01:02:55,897 --> 01:03:00,485
I am 999 years old.

776
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:08,701
Why is Honshu ravaged by development,
while Shikoku is almost untouched?

777
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:13,998
The reason is, we raccoons
protect our woods vigilantly.

778
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,002
The humans of Shikoku know

779
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:23,925
that disaster will befall them
if they anger us.

780
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:28,054
In fact, all three of us are worshipped

781
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:33,601
at every shrine and temple in Shikoku.

782
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,521
The humans revere us.

783
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,482
But I have not introduced myself.

784
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,735
I am lnugami Gyobu,

785
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,864
supreme leader
of the raccoons of Matsuyama.

786
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:54,705
I am Kincho VI, direct descendent
of Kincho Shrine's first raccoon master.

787
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,001
To frighten the humans of Tokyo
and drive them out,

788
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,005
we have resolved to carry out
Operation Specter.

789
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,133
This operation will require

790
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,429
unprecedented powers
of mental concentration,

791
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:15,017
concentration so great
that the three of us may lose our lives.

792
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:21,399
But if you successfully
carry out this plan,

793
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,278
you will regain the humans' fear

794
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:30,157
and respect without fail.

795
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:37,331
And then, you can use
the humans' fear of raccoons

796
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:42,461
to put an end to this infernal development
once and for all!

797
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,590
We have a full array of potent tricks.

798
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,468
We have brought you a boat, O raccoons,

799
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,180
that will ferry all of you
back to a lost era of greatness!

800
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:58,394
We promise you: all who come aboard
will reach those blessed shores!

801
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:16,787
Hooray! Hooray!

802
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,249
What a beautiful moon.

803
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,045
We raccoons love moonlit nights.

804
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:30,593
Let us pray to the moon
for the success of our enterprise.

805
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,387
Right, everybody?

806
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:50,988
The raccoons immediately embarked
on a special regimen of training.

807
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:12,885
Congratulations on your
nine hundred and ninety-ninth birthday!

808
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:19,350
Thank you everyone! Thank you!

809
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,020
Master, please re-enact
the story of Yoichi the Archer,

810
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,647
as you witnessed it in your younger days!

811
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,566
So I shall!

812
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,323
The time is ripe!

813
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,208
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

814
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,798
Year 33 of the Pom Poko era, December.

815
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,302
The day for Operation Specter
arrived at last.

816
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:41,432
Slightly cloudy, no wind.
Thirteen degrees centigrade, humidity 65%.

817
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,768
Perfect conditions for specters.

818
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:25,184
Transformation into monsters and specters
has always been a raccoon strong point.

819
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:29,438
But now, they needed to draw
not only on their own latent energy,

820
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,316
but also the hidden energy of the cosmos:

821
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,905
Fire, earth, water and air.

822
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:41,992
The intensity of the training
undertaken by the raccoons

823
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:47,665
under the tutelage
of the three elders of Shikoku

824
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,085
is almost beyond description.

825
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:55,089
All the raccoons,
even those who could not shape-shift,

826
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:58,509
worked together
to focus their combined powers.

827
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,765
That night, the fighting spirit
of the raccoons merged

828
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,433
into one consuming flame.

829
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:10,146
Their enthusiasm was so boundless,
they transformed themselves into specters

830
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,566
long before they even reached
the dwellings of the humans.

831
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,530
Hey, look at that!

832
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,870
What is it?

833
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:35,212
Let the trees burst into full flower!

834
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:46,307
Let the trees burst into full flower!

835
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,453
Wow... it's a big parade of specters!

836
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:16,874
I used to see stuff like that too,
way back when.

837
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,461
You know, foxes with lanterns,
that kind of thing.

838
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,340
You can really see them.

839
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,217
You can see the lanterns.

840
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,678
With little lights in them.

841
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:34,600
You can see them marching along.

842
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,442
I wonder why I could see them?

843
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,987
Maybe foxes can really do that.

844
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,698
I wonder.

845
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,121
You can really see them.

846
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,918
It must be your brain
playing tricks on you.

847
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:07,424
A fox wedding. Foxes with lanterns.
It's already in your head.

848
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,927
So, it's like...

849
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,931
Your brain plays tricks on you.

850
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:18,435
You can see them walking.
It's all in your head.

851
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:26,735
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way it's real.

852
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,781
People's brains are scary.

853
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,576
You think things, and then you see them.

854
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:38,163
There's no way they could be real, though.

855
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,377
They really are real!

856
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,382
It's just your brain
playing tricks on you.

857
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,346
Welcome home.

858
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,225
Sachiko!

859
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,117
WAYS OF A PERVERT

860
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,038
PUBLIC RESTROOM

861
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,400
Matter is void!

862
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,578
Form is emptiness!

863
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:34,988
Here they come again!

864
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,904
Master Gyobu!

865
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,907
-Master Gyobu!
-Master Gyobu!

866
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,292
That was amazing!

867
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,127
That was scary, wasn't it?

868
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,173
Aw, is that the end?

869
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,552
-That was really cool!
-Yes.

870
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:41,221
Come on, time for bed.

871
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:43,015
Oh, okay...

872
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:48,437
Don't forget to brush your teeth!

873
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,443
I feel like I just woke up from a dream.

874
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,946
Me too. What was all that about, I wonder?

875
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:02,034
After that, flying saucers
would seem pretty tame.

876
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,745
There are some things
you just can't explain.

877
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,544
Long ago, when the Matsuyama
clan was at war,

878
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,672
Gyobu went over to the enemy,
causing the downfall of his clan.

879
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:19,468
He regretted this so deeply

880
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:26,558
that he made a solemn vow to devote
his life to fighting for justice.

881
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:30,604
We must ensure his sacrifice
was not in vain,

882
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:37,235
emulate his noble spirit, and vow
not to rest until the day of our victory!

883
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:41,573
Gyahte gyahte hara gyahte

884
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:47,537
A raccoon of Potamochi Mountain

885
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,124
Got drunk and transformed himself

886
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,586
Great success to Operation Specter

887
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:57,756
The raccoons were so convinced
they had won

888
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,884
that no one bothered
to watch the news on TV.

889
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:03,679
Police and the media
are searching for anyone

890
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,848
who might have videotaped
tonight's mysterious parade.

891
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,351
But so far no one has come forward,

892
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,312
complicating efforts
to determine what really happened.

893
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:17,067
I'm sure I was taping the whole thing,
but there's nothing on the tape.

894
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,736
It doesn't make any sense.

895
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:23,532
The specter slipped in
right through this opening.

896
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:28,662
It was terrifying!
Nobody could have staged that.

897
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,874
There really is something strange
about New Town after all.

898
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,961
I'd like to move out, but it's not easy.

899
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,880
There will be a special program
at 12:20 am.

900
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:43,176
With in-depth coverage
of this evening's strange events.

901
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:56,898
The more people investigate this,

902
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:02,112
the more they will be convinced
it was no hallucination,

903
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:05,741
that it all really happened!

904
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:10,412
Then, when they realise
their science and logic are powerless

905
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:14,291
to unlock the riddle of what happened...

906
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:19,629
They'll be dumbfounded
by the awesome mystery of the cosmos,

907
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:25,635
and realise how insignificant
human existence really is.

908
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:30,474
Listen, everyone: Our good fortune
awaits, but let's not wait for it!

909
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,934
Come then!

910
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:38,690
Drink! Sing! Dance!

911
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:43,153
Let's hear it for Master Hage!

912
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:50,118
But the next day,
events took a totally unexpected turn.

913
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,413
It appears that the massive parade
staged yesterday

914
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,582
in a residential complex of Tama New Town

915
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,959
may have been
a publicity stunt for Wonderland,

916
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,003
a theme park
now under construction in the area.

917
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:03,632
Police have summoned PR executives
of Wonderland for questioning,

918
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,218
on suspicion of having staged
a parade without a permit.

919
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,552
You gotta be kidding!

920
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,180
However, residents of the complex
and the surrounding area

921
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,516
remain convinced
that what they saw yesterday

922
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,184
could not have been a publicity stunt.

923
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,269
You can say that again!

924
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,981
The president of the company responsible
for Wonderland has admitted

925
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,983
that the parade was a promotional event.

926
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,485
What?

927
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,946
PRESIDENT OF WONDERLAND
AT EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

928
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:32,828
I deeply apologise for any inconvenience
caused by our parade yesterday.

929
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:34,496
Who the hell is he?

930
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:40,168
We just wanted the world
to know how wonderful, ah,

931
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:45,590
Wonderland will be.

932
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:49,344
So we decided the best way was to go out
and give the public a free taste of the...

933
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,848
hmm, wonders they will soon be able
to experience in Wonderland.

934
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:57,143
As president of Wonderland,

935
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:01,648
I take full responsibility for the staging
of this unauthorized event.

936
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:03,942
-What a liar!
-That's ridiculous!

937
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:05,110
Fortunately,

938
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:09,698
we received
an overwhelmingly positive response

939
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,077
to our parade.

940
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:20,125
Frankly, we were astonished
at the enthusiasm we encountered.

941
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:24,129
If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail,

942
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:30,051
the positive reaction we received
will make it all worthwhile.

943
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,723
-What in the world?
-ls this for real?

944
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,058
There's got to be some mistake here!

945
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:41,229
If this humble servant of the theme park
going public has to go to jail...

946
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,939
What an asshole!

947
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,695
This new development plunged
the raccoons into a state of panic.

948
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,157
Meanwhile, Wonderland
was desperately searching for the people

949
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,451
who staged the parade.

950
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,453
It's too late!

951
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,497
Beat the bushes if you have to!

952
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,167
Just find out who did it
and hire them all!

953
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:06,087
Throw money at them!
I'll pay whatever they want!

954
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,797
It was the work of raccoons.

955
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,299
What's that? Raccoons?

956
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:15,096
I don't care if it was penguins! I want
them all working exclusively for me!

957
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,435
Raccoons? Wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

958
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,646
Oh, just a little joke.

959
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:26,942
Who are you? How did you get in here?

960
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,110
Your assistant let me in.

961
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,614
I am Ryutaro.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

962
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,618
This affair is a bit delicate.

963
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,746
If you want to work
with the people who did this,

964
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,083
I'm probably the only one
who can deliver them to you.

965
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:46,836
Fine! I'll pay you 100 million yen.

966
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:54,469
The raccoons were dumbfounded.

967
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,681
This bizarre human
had completely stolen their thunder.

968
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,684
At first, they railed
against the unfairness of it all.

969
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,603
But soon, the sheer hopelessness
of their situation

970
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,398
began to sap their will to fight.

971
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:11,236
Meanwhile,
with no footage of Operation Specter,

972
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,029
media coverage petered out

973
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,992
and the public
rapidly lost interest in the whole affair.

974
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,633
You're a fox!

975
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,179
Truly, you have a discerning eye.

976
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:43,018
I am Ryutaro, the shape-shifting fox,
at your service.

977
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:50,191
I am honored to meet you, master Kincho.
I have heard much about you.

978
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,486
I'm nothing more than the sixth
in a long line.

979
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:57,032
And what business brings you here?

980
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,285
I was amazed by your fabulous parade.

981
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,912
At last, someone who understands!

982
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:04,164
How could I not?

983
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:08,293
And you have my deepest sympathies
for everything you've had to bear.

984
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:15,675
I see... At least someone understands
what we're going through.

985
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,929
And I was hardly surprised
by what happened after the parade.

986
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,182
What's that you say?

987
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,685
Ryutaro the shape-shifting fox
could charm the birds from the trees.

988
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,229
He convinced Kincho to come to Ginza.

989
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,357
He showed the raccoon into a private room
in one of Tokyo's swankiest clubs.

990
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:32,734
Step right this way.

991
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,156
Not to worry! All my girls are foxes.

992
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,204
Do you like them this way?

993
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:45,246
Would foxes suit you better?

994
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:48,500
Or they can be raccoons, if you prefer.

995
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,962
I'll get right to the point.

996
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,590
There's no future
for the raccoons of Tama.

997
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,218
They'll die out, just like the foxes.

998
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:01,679
So that's what happened
to the foxes of Tama.

999
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,473
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1000
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:10,146
The few of us who could shape-shift
have to live like this now.

1001
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:11,648
Among the humans?

1002
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:15,193
That's the only way to survive
in the big city.

1003
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:18,029
And that's why I invited you here,

1004
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,990
to recommend
that you raccoons do the same.

1005
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,951
Now hold on a minute!

1006
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:26,287
I know this must come as a shock,
but allow me to complete the picture.

1007
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,749
It's not enough
to start over in the human world.

1008
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,002
If you must swallow poison,
drink the whole cup.

1009
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:36,673
The best move would be for you all
to go to work for Wonderland,

1010
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,675
and solve your problem at once.

1011
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:43,680
You can't be serious! Work for the people
who made monkeys of us?

1012
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,015
Let's think about this calmly.

1013
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,852
It's time for you raccoons
to start living as humans.

1014
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,937
That's a foregone conclusion.

1015
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,940
It takes big money to live like a human!

1016
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:56,693
And how do you make the money you need?

1017
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:59,112
You use the skills you have!

1018
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:03,533
And who's going to pay the highest salary?

1019
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,537
I'm afraid that would be your enemy,
Wonderland.

1020
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:10,331
They tell me
they'll pay generous benefits too.

1021
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:15,920
Here's the salary,
and these are the benefits.

1022
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,967
Naturally, I'll be the only one
who knows you're raccoons.

1023
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,806
Please enjoy.

1024
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,352
Now then,
let's take our time and think this over.

1025
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,731
Master Kincho,
you must be used to eating better food

1026
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:36,482
than the scraps you get in Tama.

1027
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,776
I'm sure it's hard for you.

1028
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,069
That's not important.

1029
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,031
What I want to know is...

1030
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:47,118
The raccoons
who can shape-shift live as humans,

1031
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:50,079
but what about the ones who can't?

1032
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,998
They'll have to fend for themselves.

1033
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:57,212
The strongest genes must prevail
if the species is going to survive.

1034
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,758
We foxes had to abandon the others,
but we had no choice.

1035
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,469
And so... they died out.

1036
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:07,847
Yes, they did.
It was the choice we had to make.

1037
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,186
Ah, this is a tragedy!

1038
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:19,609
Well, you know, you raccoons
are omnivorous. Not like us foxes.

1039
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,196
Those who can't shape-shift
might not do so badly after all.

1040
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:25,990
Meanwhile, the raccoons met once again,

1041
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:31,454
to consider what might be done
to improve their depressing situation.

1042
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,290
Only the core group came.

1043
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,711
"We have a full array of potent tricks."
A load of hot air!

1044
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:43,216
We were idiots to think
those old dudes could help us.

1045
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,469
Reminds me of the saying,

1046
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:49,097
"Don't sell the pelt
till you catch the raccoon."

1047
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:54,560
No, I don't think even Buddha
could have seen how this would turn out.

1048
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,563
You shouldn't blame the masters.

1049
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:01,776
The humans say people like the president
of Wonderland are "sly as a raccoon."

1050
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,153
Humans are so weird.

1051
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:07,782
Speak for yourself, Shokichi.

1052
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:11,619
I just mean we need to do
a lot more research on the humans.

1053
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,748
Shut up! It's time to challenge them
to a fight to the death!

1054
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,834
Control yourself, Gonta.

1055
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:21,879
It seems to me
our only choice is to reveal

1056
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:28,344
that Operation Specter
was really staged by us raccoons.

1057
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,680
Have you lost your mind, Osho?

1058
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:34,225
We can't reveal ourselves to the humans.
It's an ironclad rule.

1059
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:40,356
She's right. If the humans knew
we did it, they'd hunt us all down.

1060
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,484
But it's so frustrating!

1061
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:47,864
Someone else
got the credit for all our work.

1062
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:51,868
I just can't accept it.
I want to tell the world!

1063
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:56,205
I want to shout it out! "We did that!"

1064
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:02,295
Master Osho, what could we do
to convince them it was us?

1065
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,132
All we have to do
is take public credit for it.

1066
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:09,635
Call the TV stations. Send out letters.

1067
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:14,640
They'd just think
it was somebody's idea of a joke.

1068
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:18,644
Then one of us should go on TV
and demonstrate for them.

1069
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,355
Nonsense.

1070
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:24,650
The humans would just think it was staged,
and we'd be humiliated again.

1071
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,028
You see? Talk is useless!

1072
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:32,909
The debate dragged on through the night
and into the next morning.

1073
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:38,081
You see? Talk is useless!

1074
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:42,126
But if we become terrorists,

1075
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,754
that will just incite
the humans to wipe us out!

1076
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:48,174
I keep telling you! We do it
without them knowing it was us!

1077
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:50,718
This means we can't do anything
that's really effective.

1078
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:59,352
Instead of going off half-cocked
in different directions,

1079
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:04,732
I think we should join forces for another,
even bigger Operation Specter.

1080
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,571
Where's the guarantee
we'll have a different outcome?

1081
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:14,826
All we have to do
is to get together like we did before.

1082
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,830
Ha! You're just playing around
in the sandbox.

1083
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:23,000
You're like a stinking girl!

1084
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,419
Watch your tongue, Gonta.

1085
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,046
That's no way to talk about women.

1086
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,134
Okay, but if he was a stinking girl,
that's what he'd be like!

1087
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:34,637
Anyway, I'm going to start getting ready
for Operation Specter part two.

1088
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,140
Yeah? You and who else?

1089
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:39,892
Do you think anyone'll follow you?

1090
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:41,602
What was that?!

1091
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,688
Moron!

1092
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,190
Knock it off!

1093
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:49,944
Listen everyone!

1094
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:53,447
There's only one way out of this.

1095
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:56,325
We have to use our shape-shifting skills

1096
01:30:56,742 --> 01:31:00,830
like we did for Operation Specter!

1097
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:06,544
You know what kind of impact
Operation Specter had on the humans.

1098
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:12,800
But everyone thinks that idiot president
of Wonderland was responsible.

1099
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:15,845
So what can we do?

1100
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:21,851
How would you get
this egg to stand on end?

1101
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:27,440
This is how Columbus did it.

1102
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,361
Very impressive!

1103
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,865
You must have a really brilliant solution.

1104
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:43,206
It's time for us
to begin living as humans!

1105
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,459
No way!

1106
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:49,795
No, I'm absolutely serious.
This is not a joke.

1107
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,506
But what about the ones
who can't shape-shift?

1108
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,051
Where's Osho?

1109
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:58,221
APPEAL FROM 808 RACCOONS

1110
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,559
With Osho gone,

1111
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:07,688
the raccoons could not agree
whether or not to follow Kinchi's plan.

1112
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:10,399
Their unity began to unravel.

1113
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:16,781
Operation Specter took precedence over
important matters like food gathering.

1114
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:21,619
Most of the raccoons turned to survival,
but Gonta began gathering followers.

1115
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:25,081
Meanwhile, age seemed to have addled
Master Hage's brain.

1116
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:27,708
He took in the raccoons
who could not shape-shift,

1117
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,002
and initiated them
into a Buddhist dancing cult.

1118
01:32:31,003 --> 01:32:34,048
This world is an abyss, a mud boat

1119
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:37,176
Invoke the name of Amida and dance

1120
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,263
Namu Amida Butsu, this is the end for us

1121
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:42,556
Paradise will be our boat

1122
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,269
Master Hage was always so hale and lucid.

1123
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,146
What an awful place Tokyo is!

1124
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,440
If Operation Specter
had taken place in Shikoku,

1125
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:54,610
the humans would have known
it was us raccoons.

1126
01:32:54,777 --> 01:33:00,950
Offerings to us at shrines and temples
would have increased tenfold.

1127
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:02,827
Master Kincho!

1128
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:07,623
Master Kincho, my fervent desire
is to accompany you back to Matsushima

1129
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:09,834
and devote myself to training.

1130
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:13,838
Is that so, Tamasaburo?

1131
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,214
Yes.

1132
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:18,718
You're prepared to become my successor?

1133
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,511
Yes, Master Kincho.

1134
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,680
I've been waiting for those words!

1135
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:28,227
But you're not selfishly abandoning
your fellows

1136
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:33,858
to get back to Koharu, are you?

1137
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,736
Of course not, Master Kincho. Only...

1138
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,904
Only what?

1139
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:43,284
Even Master Kincho has lost the support
of the other raccoons.

1140
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:46,162
What purpose would it even serve
to stay here?

1141
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:49,165
I think there's something
we can do about that.

1142
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,383
Wow, this is quite an amazing restaurant!

1143
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,472
The owner has spared no expense
to make your visit a pleasant one.

1144
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,521
This place is really something!

1145
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,525
Good grief, it's better than Disneyland!

1146
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,072
A HUNDRED MILLION GOOD FORTUNES

1147
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:42,343
And so Master Kincho
not only got his revenge on Wonderland,

1148
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:46,555
he obtained a massive war chest
for the raccoons.

1149
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:51,268
The president of Wonderland
rushed to the police

1150
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,979
to report the theft of 100 million yen
by a pack of raccoons.

1151
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:55,689
But no one would listen to him.

1152
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:02,196
Meanwhile, Gonta and his crew
of hardliners were taking steps

1153
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:05,491
to stop humans
from further clearing the forest.

1154
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:25,719
Attention, environmentalists!

1155
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:31,225
Stop interfering with our snake
extermination and leave immediately!

1156
01:35:32,184 --> 01:35:37,273
You will be subject to prosecution!

1157
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:39,775
If you do not immediately
heed this warning and leave,

1158
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:47,867
we will use force to remove you!

1159
01:35:59,795 --> 01:36:04,008
But Gonta and his army
ignored the warning.

1160
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:06,635
They pinned the police,
hunters and workers to the road

1161
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,430
and kept them from advancing an inch.

1162
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:12,892
And so both sides
continued the face-off as night fell.

1163
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:25,362
What? If Gonta insists on doing this,
we ought to be standing with him!

1164
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:34,413
Can't you hear? The riot police
are already here. It's too late.

1165
01:36:39,793 --> 01:36:41,670
I'm going to take a look!

1166
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:45,007
-Shokichi! They'll get you too!
-I'm going with him!

1167
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:59,563
-Ready, guys?
-Right!

1168
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:04,485
Even if we should fall
in the heat of battle,

1169
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:08,989
our deaths are certain to redouble
our brothers' resolve to carry on,

1170
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:15,120
till the day of victory dawns!

1171
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:21,043
Our raccoon balls swing in the wind

1172
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:25,798
Back and forth, back and forth

1173
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:30,094
Amen

1174
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:31,262
Special ops! Move aside!

1175
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,097
Gonta, wait!

1176
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:34,515
Move out!

1177
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,033
Gonta.

1178
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:38,829
The raccoons used their family jewels
as weapons in a desperate kamikaze attack.

1179
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,583
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

1180
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:47,379
Meanwhile,
in another part of Tama Hills,

1181
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,049
a reporter was trying
to interview the raccoons.

1182
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:53,385
Mr. Raccoon, please come out.

1183
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:56,555
Any form you want to take is fine.

1184
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:02,978
The crew from  World TeleReporter
is on your side!

1185
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:09,526
It looks like
they're not so eager to come out.

1186
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:17,076
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon
Why don't we talk?

1187
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:20,788
We've got nothing to eat

1188
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:24,249
They answered! It's true after all!

1189
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,545
We'd like to hear
more about this from you.

1190
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,756
Won't you please come out?

1191
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:35,260
Oh! There they are!
It's the raccoons! It's them!

1192
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:38,639
Are you raccoons
really responsible for the specter parade?

1193
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,683
That's right!

1194
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:45,479
Please change into something
for our viewers.

1195
01:39:45,562 --> 01:39:50,567
Otherwise no one will believe us.

1196
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:54,988
Some of us can't shape-shift.

1197
01:39:55,155 --> 01:40:00,285
So if the woods are all gone,
we'll have nowhere to live!

1198
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,586
Raccoons, please listen!

1199
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:14,675
If you don't come out, this will make
our report look like fake news!

1200
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:18,887
If you want people to believe you,

1201
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:22,307
you'll have to show yourselves.

1202
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,101
Osho!

1203
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:29,523
Please go tell the humans everything!

1204
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:39,032
He came out! He came out!

1205
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:41,744
A ceramic raccoon is walking toward me!

1206
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,836
ACCOUNTING LEDGER

1207
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:54,965
Mr. Raccoon, a word for our viewers!

1208
01:40:56,258 --> 01:41:00,471
We...we...

1209
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,347
Yes?

1210
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:06,935
Go ahead!

1211
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:08,812
Granny Oroku!

1212
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,570
It was us! We did that parade!

1213
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:18,906
These woods are our home!

1214
01:41:19,364 --> 01:41:21,492
Please don't destroy them!

1215
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:24,745
We speak for every animal in the forest!

1216
01:42:07,996 --> 01:42:12,000
The person I saw yesterday is gone today

1217
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:15,629
The person I see today
Will be gone tomorrow

1218
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,592
Who knows what will happen to us tomorrow?

1219
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:23,720
Today everyone is sad

1220
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:28,141
Master Hage, last surviving witness
of the battle of Yashima,

1221
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:33,814
was 999 years old.

1222
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:37,776
But he had seen enough, and he
decided to bid the world farewell.

1223
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:43,156
With a song of triumph, the raccoons
stretched his vast testicles

1224
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:46,535
into a fabulous treasure ship,
with fittings of lacquer and gold.

1225
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:47,870
TREASURE

1226
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:54,543
Singing and dancing,
they boarded the ship,

1227
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:59,089
as they left behind a world
of suffering for the shores of bliss.

1228
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:04,553
The ordinary raccoons imagined paradise

1229
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:09,433
and boarded
as if they were going on an outing.

1230
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:19,151
The treasure ship set off down
the Tama River, swaying in the moonlight.

1231
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:24,031
The current bore the ship downstream,
the sail stood proudly in the breeze.

1232
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:26,992
The boat was full,

1233
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:30,245
the sail was flying high.

1234
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:35,208
Now the tide helped them forward
as the moon glinted off the water.

1235
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,839
The raccoons drummed on their bellies
as the ship sailed away,

1236
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:43,592
drumming and drumming
on this dreamy night.

1237
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:46,970
They celebrated with bells,
shamisen, flutes, and drums.

1238
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:53,644
The ship was laden with gold,
silver and precious coral.

1239
01:43:54,227 --> 01:43:55,854
With tears in their eyes,

1240
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:59,650
the raccoons watching from the shore
prayed this would be no mud boat.

1241
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:06,281
As in a dream, the ship sailed on
past mist-shrouded woods and fields.

1242
01:44:06,365 --> 01:44:11,745
The raccoons strained to catch a glimpse
of Amida beckoning from paradise.

1243
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:15,248
The treasure ship
crossed over to the next world.

1244
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:18,377
Singing and dancing, the raccoons
crossed over to the next world.

1245
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:21,505
With bells and flutes,
they crossed over to the next world.

1246
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:25,509
With samisen and drums,
they crossed over to the next world.

1247
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:30,764
They crossed over to the next world,
and they never returned.

1248
01:44:34,643 --> 01:44:38,730
You can't beat the humans after all

1249
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:02,421
Bunta, it's you!

1250
01:45:03,588 --> 01:45:05,674
Bunta! Bunta!

1251
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:08,093
-Tamasaburo!
-Bunta!

1252
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:13,348
You've finally returned!

1253
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,975
Sasuke! Shokichi!

1254
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,605
Did you find Master Danzaburo?
Did you reach Sado and see the master?

1255
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:25,819
I learned at last
that he was shot by a hunter years ago,

1256
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:30,782
after the war, when food was scarce.

1257
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,412
How sad.
I was looking forward to meeting him.

1258
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:38,957
You did well, Bunta.

1259
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:49,593
What happened here in only three years?
I feel like Urashima Taro.

1260
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:52,929
We did everything we could to stop it.

1261
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,890
But everything has changed beyond belief!

1262
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,975
The land has shape-shifted,
not us raccoons.

1263
01:45:57,059 --> 01:46:00,979
-We understand how you must feel.
-Did the humans really do all this?

1264
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:04,232
Yes, they did. They did it all.

1265
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:08,111
No, it can't be! Only raccoons
can change things like this.

1266
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:10,238
We're the only ones!

1267
01:46:11,364 --> 01:46:13,784
The humans were really raccoons after all!

1268
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:17,829
Old, stinking raccoons!

1269
01:46:19,664 --> 01:46:26,254
Give us back our woods! Give us back
our fields! Give us back our homes!

1270
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:42,020
Shall we give it one more try?

1271
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:47,192
Let's use the power we have left
to put everything back the way it was.

1272
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:52,239
We'll see who's better at shape-shifting.

1273
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,865
The raccoons or the humans.

1274
01:46:55,242 --> 01:47:01,164
Sounds like fun! I can remember
every detail of the way things used to be.

1275
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:04,584
All right, then.
One last guerrilla attack!

1276
01:47:05,043 --> 01:47:08,588
But what's the point?
It's already too late.

1277
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:12,050
Oh, it'll cheer us up.
That's all that matters.

1278
01:47:13,301 --> 01:47:17,681
It's this playful spirit
that makes us raccoons, after all.

1279
01:47:18,473 --> 01:47:20,976
Master Kincho, will you help us?

1280
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:25,480
Of course, though it may turn out
a bit like Shikoku.

1281
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:27,482
Ponkichi!

1282
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:30,569
Here I am! Shall I round up the others?

1283
01:47:30,652 --> 01:47:32,529
Will you lend us your energy
one more time?

1284
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:33,989
You can rely on me!

1285
01:49:29,187 --> 01:49:31,564
Wait up for me!

1286
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:47,622
Why, that's Mother!

1287
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,294
And Yotchan! It's Yotchan!

1288
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,505
Yotchan!

1289
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:24,743
That's us!
That's us when we were children!

1290
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:34,127
Look, raccoons!

1291
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:36,838
Wow! They're cute!

1292
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,216
Those are raccoons, right?

1293
01:50:40,383 --> 01:50:44,804
I'm surprised to see them here,
so close to the city.

1294
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:51,311
Hey, raccoons! Don't go!

1295
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,317
Aw, they're gone.

1296
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:01,071
It would've been fun to feed them.

1297
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:04,324
I wonder if they can really shape-shift
like in the stories?

1298
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:10,789
So in the end, we were defeated after all.

1299
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:15,960
Tama New Town kept growing
without the slightest hindrance from us.

1300
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:21,549
As the years passed, the city settled in

1301
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,011
and became a pretty nice place
for people to live.

1302
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:31,768
The hill where Manpuku Temple stood
is a trendy residential district.

1303
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:36,022
And I think our shape-shifting

1304
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:40,235
did have a good influence on the humans.

1305
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:46,157
As it said in the papers,
they're concerned about preserving nature,

1306
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:49,285
and they're setting aside
little bits of the woods for parks,

1307
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:54,249
"to live in harmony with the raccoons."

1308
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:58,711
But the parks were too late for us.

1309
01:51:59,003 --> 01:52:00,839
They're too small for raccoons, anyway.

1310
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:07,720
Some of us moved further from the city,
where there were still woods and fields.

1311
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:10,473
But of course
there were raccoons there already,

1312
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:14,227
and with construction and the cars
that took one of us from time to time,

1313
01:52:14,352 --> 01:52:16,438
life was hard.

1314
01:52:19,732 --> 01:52:23,987
So we took the final step.

1315
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,793
That's right,

1316
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:43,131
those of us who could shape-shift
took a page from the foxes' book,

1317
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:45,550
and started living like humans.

1318
01:52:46,342 --> 01:52:49,804
Nowadays I have a desk job
and my wife, Kiyo, works at a bar.

1319
01:52:50,763 --> 01:52:52,307
A few raccoons got into real estate
and got rich

1320
01:52:52,682 --> 01:52:56,311
selling forests to developers.
They're no different from the humans.

1321
01:52:56,686 --> 01:52:59,230
Most of us are just worn out
from the stress of living in the city,

1322
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:01,691
and wish we could go back to the woods.

1323
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:07,739
I'm impressed by the humans.
It takes stamina to live the way they do.

1324
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,783
Some of us dropped out of the rat race

1325
01:53:10,867 --> 01:53:16,664
and are scrounging out a living
on the streets.

1326
01:53:24,255 --> 01:53:27,467
Oh, and what about Ponkichi
and the others who couldn't shape-shift?

1327
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:58,331
"Living for the moment"
is an expression made for raccoons.

1328
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:01,918
We never let property development
or accidents on the road get us down.

1329
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:05,338
We live as we please, relaxed
and joyous, in the present.

1330
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:09,175
We have children,
and we die, all too quickly.

1331
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:38,746
Here I go!

1332
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:43,293
Woo-hoo!

1333
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,476
Ponkichi!

1334
01:55:01,686 --> 01:55:03,062
Ponkichi!

1335
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:05,064
Shokichi!

1336
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,736
You came!

1337
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:10,904
How long has it been?

1338
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,054
You often hear on the news

1339
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:39,807
how foxes and raccoons are disappearing
because of urban development, right?

1340
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:41,893
I wish you humans would stop saying that.

1341
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:46,898
Sure, some foxes and raccoons
can shape-shift.

1342
01:55:47,398 --> 01:55:50,777
But unfortunately,
most of us can't just disappear.

1343
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:53,613
What about the rest of the animals?
