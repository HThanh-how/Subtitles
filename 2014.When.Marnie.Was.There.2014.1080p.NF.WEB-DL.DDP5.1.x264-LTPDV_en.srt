1
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,416
Wait!

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,500
You're it!

3
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,916
In this world,
there's an invisible magic circle.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,333
You're it!

5
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,416
What are you doing?

6
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,375
-So you did date him!
-What?

7
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,375
There's an inside and an outside.

8
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,791
Capture the movement.

9
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,583
-It's hard.
-Right?

10
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,708
-Let's see.
-Hey, not yet!

11
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,833
These people are inside the circle.

12
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,541
And I'm outside.

13
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,916
But I don't really care.

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,541
How's it coming?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,666
Um, I... kind of messed up.

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,916
Let me have a look.

17
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,541
Oh, no. Are you okay?

18
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,291
Hey, hey...

19
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,125
I...

20
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,666
I hate myself.

21
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,500
Anna...

22
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,916
You're fine now.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,583
Oh, I'm so glad. Thank you, Doctor.

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,166
Anna, do you feel all right now?

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,166
I'm fine.

26
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,666
You looked like you were in agony.

27
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,666
Where was your inhaler?

28
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,666
I cost you money again.

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,041
Why do you say that?

30
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,916
Oh, Miyoko.

31
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,291
I brought Anna's bag.
Her notebook is inside.

32
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,083
Why, thank you.

33
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,333
We were just nearby.
If there's anything else...

34
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,291
Wait...

35
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,166
Has Anna been getting along with you?

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,500
She tells me nothing about school.

37
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,500
She's okay.

38
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,500
But she's very quiet.

39
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,000
Quiet? More like...

40
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,666
Hey, don't.

41
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,541
We're just a bit loud.

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,541
Well, take care.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,125
Ever the worrywart, your mother.

44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,083
Mother...

45
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,375
She's probably a loner at school.

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,875
It's true that stress
can trigger asthma attacks.

47
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,000
Meanwhile,
my husband's off on a business trip.

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,750
Maybe he and I are partly to blame, too.

49
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,000
12 years old...

50
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,416
It's a difficult age.

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,166
Have you noticed anything about her?

52
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,416
She... always has a straight face.

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,250
A straight face?

54
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,291
Like she won't show her emotions...

56
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,416
She used to be more expressive.

57
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:22,000
But these days, I don't even know...

58
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:29,541
Maybe it's because we're not related
by blood.

59
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:35,375
You may want to send her
somewhere to get better.

60
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,166
7:03 DEPARTURE FOR KUSHIRO

61
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,166
Say, Anna...

62
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,166
Do you remember Uncle and Aunt Oiwa?

63
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,166
The air is very clean where they live.

64
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:09,208
It'll help your condition
to spend some time there.

65
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:15,291
I can't go with you,
but they'll take care of you.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,625
Be a good girl, eat well,

67
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,708
and come back nice and happy.

68
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,541
She whines like a goat.

69
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,041
Oh, here she is.

70
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,291
Anna.

71
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,583
Remember us?

72
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,625
No, but Auntie told me all about you.

73
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,458
I'm Anna Sasaki.

74
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,875
I hope I'm not much trouble.
Thank you for having me.

75
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,250
Our pleasure.

76
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:37,875
Auntie?

77
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,791
She means Yoriko.

78
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,875
Hop on in. Sorry it's a bit of a clunker.

79
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,291
Sorry. It's a bit cramped in here.

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,666
I don't mind at all.

81
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,666
This area's changed since I was last here.
All these new shops.

82
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,541
Where we're headed
is a nice, relaxing place.

83
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,333
But since the highway was built,
people stopped coming.

84
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,500
They still haven't fixed that pothole!

85
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,458
I hear you have asthma?

86
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,750
Uh, yes...

87
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,458
The air here will fix you up in no time.

88
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,625
Nice place, huh?
Bet you'd like Auntie to see it, too.

89
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,166
What's that over there?

90
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,625
On the cliff.

91
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:03,375
Oh, that's a silo.
It's for storing feed for livestock.

92
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,583
Hasn't been used in decades, though.

93
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,333
Now the village kids use it for dares.

94
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,541
They say there are ghosts there.

95
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,333
Dear, please!

96
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,291
He loves stories like that.

97
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,125
Best to stay away from there.

98
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,541
Look, that's our house over there.

99
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,833
-Do you mind taking this in?
-What's this?

100
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,333
Why would you accept this?

101
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,291
It's too much for us to eat.

102
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,083
He's always accepting gifts
without thinking...

103
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,208
Our kids are all grown up and moved out.

104
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
-Make yourself at home.
-Thank you.

105
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,958
Let's see, where do these go?

106
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,083
Excuse me.

107
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,083
MOM
DAD

108
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,125
You must think it's an odd house.

109
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,375
No, it's a lovely home.

110
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,875
No need for flattery.

111
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Your room's upstairs.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,833
It was my daughter's room.

113
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,750
It'd be sad to clear everything,
so I left it as it was.

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,666
I see.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,250
She's a yoga teacher in Tokyo now.

116
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,125
I'm thinking of trying it myself.

117
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,125
Oh, and feel free to use
the closet and shelves.

118
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,791
Oh, thank you.

119
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,583
"Write and tell me how you are, whatever
you wish to tell me about. Yoriko"

120
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,833
Postcards, how quaint!
You should write her.

121
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,041
Come here for a sec!

122
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,666
Coming!

123
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,541
He can be so pushy.

124
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,041
See you later.

125
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,708
Smells like someone else's home.

126
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,958
Feels nice.

127
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,625
I've arrived safely.

128
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,833
It's quite nice here.

129
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,333
Mr. and Mrs. Oiwa are both very kind.

130
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,333
TO YORIKO SASAKI

131
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,000
These are delicious.

132
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,375
Sorry, my hands are full.

133
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,000
Um, I'm going to the post office.

134
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,958
Sure, go ahead.

135
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,125
Won't you try this?

136
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,958
Later.

137
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,375
Okay, I'll save it for dessert.

138
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,208
By the way,
there's a shortcut by the parking lot.

139
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,250
Oh, thank you.

140
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,666
SHORTCUT

141
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,541
This is the shortcut?

142
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,666
SHORTCUT

143
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,083
SHORTCUT

144
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,458
SHORTCUT

145
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,166
KITAHARA GROCERIES

146
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,208
Boys just drive me mad!

147
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,166
It's tough being class president.

148
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,625
Wait, I need to drop off a letter.

149
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,625
Hey, who's that?

150
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,375
Why is it...

151
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,500
That mansion feels familiar.

152
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,958
I wonder if anyone lives here.

153
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,708
Excuse me...

154
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,333
What a big house.

155
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,916
I guess there's no one here.

156
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, no...

157
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,458
I'm sorry.

158
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,750
He's a bear. Or maybe a sea lion.

159
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,708
Sounds like an adventure!

160
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,583
Completely different in high tide,
isn't it?

161
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,708
It's the power of the moon.

162
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,083
But imagine that,
Toichi giving a girl a ride on his boat.

163
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,833
He's actually a good guy.
Just not much of a talker.

164
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,666
You should ask him for a ride again.

165
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,416
Ask him for a ride.

166
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,708
I will.

167
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,750
But it's best you stay away
from the marsh house.

168
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,166
How come?

169
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,291
-Ghosts.
-Not again!

170
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,791
I'll get some wine.

171
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,666
It looked like no one lives there.

172
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458
Not now, anyway.

173
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,166
It used to be a vacation home
for some foreigners.

174
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,666
Then it changed hands a few times.

175
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,666
But it's been vacant for a while now.

176
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,458
I see...

177
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,875
Someone's there.

178
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,375
Have you finished them yet?

179
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,708
What Mrs. Kadoya asked for.

180
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,208
Oh... Almost done.

181
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,708
Hey, Anna. Going out?

182
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Yes.

183
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,541
Just finish them already...

184
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,291
I'm going to go sketch.

185
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,791
Sure, go on.

186
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,875
Thank you.

187
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,875
Yoriko was worried about her,
but she looks fine to me.

188
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,375
As long as she's having fun
and eating well.

189
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,375
That's for sure.

190
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,333
All the trash you pick up
will be collected here.

191
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,833
Everyone listen!

192
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,250
Now begin!

193
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,375
Look, it's Toichi.

194
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,625
Toichi the mute!

195
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,125
Toichi who only talks once a decade!

196
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,625
Hey, I said we're not going
there until later!

197
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,875
We're just checking it out!

198
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,041
See ya!

199
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,291
Perhaps we'll hear from you next time!

200
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,708
I'm going out.

201
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,875
Wait, Anna.

202
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,541
I have a little errand, so hold on.

203
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,291
Yes.

204
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,958
He should be delivering these himself.

205
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,791
"I'm allergic to that lady," he says!

206
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,291
But Mrs. Kadoya's been wanting
to meet you.

207
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,541
Their daughter Nobuko
is a year older than you.

208
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,291
Nobuko is at cram school today.

209
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh, that's too bad.

210
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,291
This must be Anna. Nice to meet you.

211
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,833
Oh, um... Hello.

212
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,541
Ah, so you draw, I see?

213
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,458
Show me next time.

214
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,291
No, I'm not very good.

215
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:09,791
Oh, you should go to the Tanabata Festival
with Nobuko tomorrow.

216
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,916
Great idea! I should still have
my daughter's yukata.

217
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,666
You can wear it to the festival.

218
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,750
But...

219
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,041
Yes.

220
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,250
I'll let Nobuko know. Now come in.

221
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,250
Where'd I put it...

222
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,041
Uh, actually I...

223
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,291
Oh, you're going sketching. Go ahead!

224
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,375
She'll look great!

225
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,875
Ready, and...

226
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,958
-This one, too.
-Got it.

227
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,041
I won't look good in it.

228
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,125
None of her business.

229
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:58,958
He's not here.

230
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,791
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

231
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,833
The tide is out.

232
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,500
Again.

233
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,083
I hate festivals.

234
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,375
Hey, let's go.

235
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,875
Wait for me.

236
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,666
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

237
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,833
-Here's some candy.
-Thanks.

238
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:56,750
I wish I was wearing a yukata, too.

239
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,750
At least you're comfortable.

240
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,625
Mom forces her tastes on me. It's awful.

241
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,583
I think it looks cute.

242
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,375
What? No way!

243
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,583
It's boring and tacky...

244
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,333
So Anna, where are you from?

245
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,208
From Sapporo.

246
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,958
Cool, I bet the city has great shopping.

247
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:20,625
-Maybe lots of cute boys, too?
-You be quiet.

248
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,708
Sure, sure.

249
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,708
Here in the boonies.

250
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,708
Why'd you come out here?

251
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,791
Well...

252
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,583
What's this? Nobuko!

253
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,666
What is it?

254
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,291
He's always making the same mistakes.

255
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,375
I'll warn him next time.

256
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,916
TANABATA FESTIVAL

257
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,041
There it is.

258
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,291
Will my wish come true?

259
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,375
Can I have a candle?

260
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,000
Here you go.

261
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,083
Write your wish on this.

262
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,750
My wish...

263
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,041
Can you reach?

264
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,083
Ow!

265
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,250
Sorry about that.

266
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,583
Anna!

267
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:25,583
Hey, where were you?
I was looking for you.

268
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,750
Oh, your wish.

269
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,583
Let's see...

270
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:33,583
"I wish for a normal life everyday."

271
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,666
"Normal"?

272
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,541
Anna, what do you mean by normal?

273
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,583
Uh, well...

274
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,291
You see, um...

275
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,083
Hey, your eye color!

276
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,083
What?

277
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,458
It's really pretty.

278
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,375
It's a bit blue, like a foreigner...

279
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,958
Leave me alone!

280
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,791
You fat pig!

281
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:57,791
Fat...

282
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,791
Uh... I mean...

283
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,958
I see what you mean by normal.

284
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,166
But there's no use
pretending to be normal.

285
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,250
After all,
you look like just what you are.

286
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,750
Okay, now let's drop it.

287
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,000
You should join us next--

288
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,833
Anna!

289
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,708
Hey, watch it!

290
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,000
Like just what I am...

291
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,291
Like just what I am...

292
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,791
Ugly, stupid,

293
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,208
moody,

294
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,333
unpleasant...

295
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,875
That's why...

296
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,375
I hate myself.

297
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,541
That's why everyone...

298
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,958
We don't have long to live.
Typically, you're the ones who--

299
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,041
Still talking about that?

300
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,875
We already settled this matter.

301
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,666
We're not blaming you. It's just that...

302
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,000
I've already told you.
It's not about money.

303
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,666
I feel bad for her, but--

304
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,416
It'll be best for her if you two--

305
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,583
I'd better get home.

306
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,791
Did someone row it here?

307
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,500
It's stuck!

308
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:45,666
Throw me the rope!

309
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,541
The rope?

310
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,208
Hurry!

311
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,250
Are you okay?

312
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,625
Yeah. Oh, um...

313
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,291
Are you a real person?

314
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,583
Don't let anyone hear us.

315
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,458
You look like the girl I saw in my dreams.

316
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,291
Dreams?

317
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:55,958
Thanks.

318
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,791
It's not a dream.

319
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,500
What's your name?

320
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,166
Anna.

321
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,125
I hope we can be friends.

322
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,000
What about you?

323
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,125
Yes.

324
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,625
Have you seen me before?

325
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:24,833
Yes.

326
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,500
Often.

327
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,833
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

328
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,833
I've been here for ages...

329
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,583
Look at this, the marsh at night.

330
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:56,625
How beautiful.
Say, let's go down for a closer look.

331
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,458
Madam.

332
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,041
I know.

333
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,625
By the way, where's that child?

334
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,041
Was she not in her room?

335
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,541
I need to get back.

336
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,083
-Were they talking about you?
-Yes.

337
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,541
At this hour, I'm usually in bed.

338
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,541
Come on, I'll row you back.

339
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,083
So it was your boat.

340
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,708
Yes, I left it for you on purpose.

341
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,583
But I thought
you'd be able to row a little better.

342
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,083
I know. So did I.

343
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,083
You're my precious secret.

344
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,458
I haven't told anyone about you,
and I won't.

345
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:56,458
If someone finds out,
they'll only spoil it.

346
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,416
Please, promise me...

347
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,208
that we'll remain a secret.

348
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,083
Forever.

349
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,583
Yes.

350
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,583
It'll be our secret.

351
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:17,791
Forever.

352
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:04,333
It was awful.
She came home crying her eyes out!

353
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,041
Did Anna do something?

354
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,833
She called my daughter a fat pig!

355
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,833
Fat pig?

356
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,708
And she pulled out a knife, too.
The horror!

357
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:17,583
I doubt she'd--

358
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,958
No, you need to hear it
from the girl herself.

359
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,583
Now bring her here.

360
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,833
Seems she's not home yet.

361
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,583
She's a delinquent,
out and about this late!

362
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,833
You two are at fault, too!

363
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,833
Better keep an eye on her.

364
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,083
Take this. It's dark.

365
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,541
No, thank you.

366
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,541
What if something happens
to one of the kids?

367
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,958
So what if she's a bit late!

368
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,500
Don't get so riled up.

369
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,875
She is not a delinquent.

370
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,875
Ah, she's home.

371
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,041
Anna.

372
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,291
Aunt Oiwa...

373
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,666
Were you listening? Don't you worry.

374
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,291
You two'll make up.

375
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,541
Now take a bath and have dinner.

376
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:16,708
Thank you.

377
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:20,000
Or is it dinner before the bath?

378
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,000
It hardly matters.

379
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,500
But "fat pig" is a bit harsh.

380
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,500
That's for sure.

381
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,333
It's not that funny.

382
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,833
Auntie, worrying like always.

383
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,541
Anna! Watermelon!

384
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,500
Anna?

385
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,500
Two hours until high tide...

386
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,916
Hop in. Time for a picnic.

387
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,416
I brought juice and cookies.

388
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,625
Picnic? At this hour?

389
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,541
That's right.
Let's go to the other side of the marsh.

390
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,083
You're very good at rowing.

391
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,083
You need rowing lessons.

392
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:25,666
Come here.

393
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,750
It's easy.

394
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:43,958
Remember I said last night
that you're my precious secret?

395
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:49,291
I remember. And you're my secret.

396
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,125
I'm glad.

397
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,958
Hey!

398
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:01,625
Good, you're doing well.

399
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:09,041
But I don't even know your name yet.

400
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,208
I haven't told you yet?

401
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,250
Marnie.

402
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,500
I thought you already knew.

403
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,833
That's dangerous.

404
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,958
Go ahead, just row.

405
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:53,333
There's so much I want to know about you.

406
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,666
But I don't wish to find out too fast.

407
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,041
Let's take it slow, as we go along.

408
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:01,541
Okay.

409
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,416
I'll tell you what we'll do.

410
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:09,500
We'll ask each other
three questions a night.

411
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,416
Great.

412
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,250
All right, I'll start.

413
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:17,166
Question one.
Why are you here in this village?

414
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,000
I have asthma.

415
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:25,041
The doctor said I should go somewhere
with clean air for a while.

416
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,666
Even if I have to skip school.

417
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,333
Oh no, you're ill?

418
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,041
If there's no attack, I'm fine.

419
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,750
So I'm staying here
with Auntie's relatives, the Oiwas.

420
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,208
Who's Auntie?

421
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,041
It's my turn to ask a question.

422
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,916
Do you live in that mansion?

423
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,708
Ever since I was two.

424
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,958
With Nan and the maids.

425
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:48,916
It's juice.

426
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,916
Where are your parents?

427
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:56,583
They only come here sometimes.
They're busy with work.

428
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,125
I see.

429
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,083
Question two. Who's Auntie?

430
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,916
My guardian.

431
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:10,166
But I make her worry too much
so she got rid of me for a while.

432
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,500
What do you mean?

433
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,791
I'll explain another time.

434
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,916
It's my turn now.

435
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,375
Do you have siblings?

436
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,916
I'm an only child.

437
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,916
I see, you too...

438
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
How come?

439
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,041
Oh, it's nothing.

440
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:30,041
Just curious what it's like
to have siblings.

441
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:34,125
I know.
It's fun to imagine what it's like.

442
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,041
All right, question three.

443
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:39,333
What's it like living with the Oiwas?

444
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,041
At the Oiwas?

445
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,541
Huh...

446
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,000
How strange...

447
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,291
I can't...

448
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,666
remember...

449
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,416
Marnie?

450
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,291
Marnie!

451
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,458
Anna!

452
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,583
There you are.
I was wondering where you went.

453
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:46,916
Marnie?

454
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:55,916
I was looking for you everywhere.
You just disappeared.

455
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,416
I didn't go anywhere.

456
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,916
I was just trying to answer your question.

457
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,458
Wait...

458
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,541
What was it?

459
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,791
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

460
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,208
I need to go soon. Today is...

461
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,291
Oh, I know!

462
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:21,500
No, no, no, I really can't!
Parties aren't really my--

463
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,916
Don't worry.

464
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,916
I have a great idea.

465
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,666
It's true.

466
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,291
That's hard to believe.

467
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:21,125
Sorry, did you wait long?
I had trouble getting away.

468
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,958
Marnie.

469
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,458
What do you think?

470
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,958
It's pretty.

471
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,833
I borrowed Nan's shawl.
I'll be scolded again.

472
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:34,750
This won't work.

473
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,625
Don't worry, I spoke to Father.

474
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,500
Young lady.

475
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,500
I believe it is past your bedtime.

476
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,166
And who might this be?

477
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,708
She is wearing my shawl.

478
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,666
Upstairs!

479
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,708
Wait right there!

480
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:19,166
You are nothing but trouble.

481
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,208
You go that way.

482
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,208
Marnie!

483
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,708
Why you little--

484
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,500
Marnie! Open it!

485
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,500
Let's go.

486
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,458
If you keep this up,

487
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,958
you'll grow up to be a lousy adult!

488
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:58,958
Everyone,
we have a lovely flower girl here.

489
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,500
A guest of my daughter.

490
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,083
Ah, a flower girl.

491
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:06,458
-There's Marnie.
-She'll be pretty like her mother.

492
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,125
May I please have one of those flowers?

493
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,750
My mother.

494
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,083
Hello, my dear little witch.

495
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,083
That woman there is the real witch.

496
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:31,916
Um...

497
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:40,750
I want only one, for good luck.

498
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:45,458
Will someone kindly pay for my flower?

499
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:50,458
If it is the witch's command...

500
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,958
Then I'll have one, too.

501
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,625
-Here.
-For superb luck.

502
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,000
Ah, it's begun.

503
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,375
I'm sorry!

504
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,375
Oh, she ran away.

505
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,625
Come on and take one for good luck!

506
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:27,958
May I have one, please?

507
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:44,875
Young lady.

508
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
To your health.

509
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,166
Thank you.

510
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,375
Wine?

511
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,625
Are you awake yet?

512
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,250
I...

513
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,083
You drunkard.

514
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,958
Who was that?

515
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,500
Who?

516
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,041
The one who was dancing with you.

517
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:44,208
Kazuhiko? He's an old friend.

518
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,750
He's a good dancer.

519
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,041
So are you.

520
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:57,000
Now let's dance, you and I.

521
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,208
I can't dance.

522
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,125
Just follow my lead.

523
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Look for me again.

524
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:09,083
And don't tell anyone. Promise.

525
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,000
I know.

526
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,375
Hey, wait...

527
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,875
Is that--

528
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,875
It's the girl with the Oiwas.

529
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,750
DEAR ANNA, HOW ARE YOU?
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING IT...

530
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,666
I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON. YORIKO.

531
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,041
I see. I hope you find the other shoe.

532
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,708
It must be somewhere.

533
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,708
I'll go look for it.

534
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,041
I used to always lose mine.

535
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:26,833
There's a bunch of shoes
buried in the mudflats.

536
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,916
Don't compare her to you.

537
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,208
I should have my daughter's old shoes.

538
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,083
I'll get them out.

539
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,250
Thank you.

540
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:55,750
Marnie...

541
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,291
Wow.

542
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:37,666
Not only are they big,
they're delicious, too.

543
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,541
You're good with the knife.

544
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,083
Auntie teaches me all the time.

545
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:03,208
You're so polite and well-behaved.

546
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,041
My daughter could learn from you.

547
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:08,916
Passing behind you.

548
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:13,250
I remember when you first came
to Yoriko's place.

549
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,916
She was ecstatic.

550
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,916
She wanted to make up for the five years
she didn't have with you.

551
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:28,583
So she taught you things,
like knife skills.

552
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,041
But she worries too much.

553
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,833
Always calling me for help.

554
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:42,333
When I told her I was busy,
she started pouting.

555
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:44,875
Oh, I shouldn't share this
about your mother.

556
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,250
No, I understand.

557
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,875
You know,
Yoriko sent us tons of photos of you.

558
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,291
I'll show you later.

559
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,958
Hey, look.

560
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,875
Found the wind chime
I made on our honeymoon.

561
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,583
To survive the summer.

562
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,083
Your hair's getting long.

563
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,625
Shall I give you a haircut?

564
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,958
That would be a disaster.

565
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,000
Mar... nie...

566
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,541
Look for me again.

567
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,041
How could I nearly forget about Marnie?

568
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,041
Marnie...

569
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,083
Marnie!

570
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,041
Marnie...

571
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,458
May I?

572
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:11,583
Sure.

573
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,500
I see you draw, too.

574
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,041
That girl looks like someone I knew.

575
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,791
She was a great girl.

576
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,458
Yes, she is.

577
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,500
But I haven't seen her in a week.

578
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,791
I wonder if she's upset that I forgot.

579
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:37,458
If she's a friend,
talk to her and you'll be fine.

580
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,125
Say, will you take a look?

581
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:42,791
Sure.

582
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,708
Are the colors too messy?

583
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,083
No, it's wonderful.

584
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,041
I'm Hisako.

585
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:01,833
I'm in love with the marsh house.
What about you?

586
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,875
I'm Anna. I love it, too.

587
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:16,041
Better hurry and finish your drawing...

588
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,333
before the new folks move in.

589
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,833
The renovations are under way.

590
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:27,958
Thanks for your hard work. Have some tea.

591
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,666
Oh, thank you. Appreciate it.

592
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,083
Hey, let's take a break!

593
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,041
All right, coming.

594
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,708
Are you Marnie?

595
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,791
Come.

596
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,875
I hadn't seen the front before.

597
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,125
It's a lot cleaner now,
but it's not finished yet.

598
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,916
Hello.

599
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,291
Hey there.

600
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,375
You brought a friend, huh?

601
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,708
Choose your slippers.

602
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:29,500
A guest?

603
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:30,500
Yeah, a secret one.

604
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,333
Secret?

605
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:33,750
Hey!

606
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,500
Sorry, make yourself at home.

607
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:39,583
Thank you.

608
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,458
Yes, it's a lovely place.

609
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,875
Yes, we haven't finished renovating.

610
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:51,958
This room...

611
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,375
Upstairs.

612
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,166
This hasn't been renovated yet.

613
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,416
Here, this is my room.

614
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,458
Really...

615
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,208
What do you think?

616
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:18,875
It's a cute room.

617
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,125
It used to be your room, right?

618
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,791
You're...

619
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:27,833
Marnie, right?

620
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,208
Me? No, no!

621
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:35,250
But... then why have you been staring
at my room?

622
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,083
Because--

623
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:39,125
See, that's where I always see you.

624
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:42,208
I've seen you many times.

625
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,250
No, no.

626
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,708
I just love this mansion, that's all.

627
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:49,791
That can't be.

628
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,458
When I said Marnie earlier,
you were surprised.

629
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:57,416
Rather, why do you know Marnie?

630
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,166
I found it behind the shelf.

631
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,083
A diary?

632
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,833
That's right. Your diary.

633
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,041
Marnie!

634
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:24,541
I'll pour you some Queen Mary,
your favorite.

635
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:26,750
I'll be back.

636
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,541
"Last night I went
for a row in my nightie.

637
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,583
The marsh and the moon
were very pretty at night."

638
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,291
I shall do it again.

639
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,708
June 8th. A party!

640
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:54,541
Father, Mother and many of their friends
came over. It was such fun.

641
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,083
I went outside from the sunroom

642
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:02,250
and danced with a flower girl.

643
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,625
But...

644
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,916
Nan locked me in my room
because of last night.

645
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,041
So there won't be
any midnight rows for a while.

646
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:26,416
See, it's you, isn't it?

647
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,958
No.

648
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:31,875
Marnie is...

649
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,083
Marnie is...

650
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,791
someone I made up.

651
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,583
An imaginary girl, only in my mind.

652
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:46,791
But this is Marnie's diary.

653
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's as if she really lived here.

654
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,208
So you're not Marnie?

655
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,125
No.

656
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,125
She's just imaginary?

657
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,208
That's right.

658
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:06,500
I thought you were Marnie,
and you came back for the diary...

659
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:13,958
I'm Anna.
I came from Sapporo to get better.

660
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,541
I'm Sayaka.

661
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,208
I'm from Tokyo.

662
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:25,291
But if she was imaginary,
why is the name in the diary the same?

663
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:27,708
I don't know.

664
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,666
Marnie must be real.
I'm going to investigate.

665
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,916
Tell me, Marnie...

666
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,416
Who are you?

667
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,375
Is that me?

668
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,833
Marnie?

669
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,583
Marnie!

670
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,791
Um...

671
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:43,291
Wait, that one's not finished yet...

672
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:46,291
Wow, you draw well.

673
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,333
Oh, thanks...

674
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:53,083
I've never had anyone
draw me before. How nice!

675
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,000
I missed you.

676
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:08,458
I kept calling you in my heart.

677
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:13,791
Me, too.

678
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:15,375
Let's go.

679
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,541
Come to my room.

680
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:20,666
Come to my room, Marnie.

681
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:26,833
I can't go very far from the mansion.

682
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:33,166
Okay then, we'll go wherever you want.

683
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,750
You know a lot about mushrooms.

684
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:08,666
Father taught me when I was little.

685
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,500
I once brought home
three bags full of mushrooms.

686
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,333
The look on Mother's face!

687
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:26,791
What's wrong?

688
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,375
You're so quiet all of a sudden.

689
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,541
You're very lucky.

690
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:35,916
I wish I was you.

691
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,958
Talk to me.

692
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,375
I'm...

693
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,791
a foster child.

694
01:05:56,916 --> 01:06:00,583
My real parents died when I was little.

695
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,708
My grandmother, too.

696
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:06,958
I know they didn't die on purpose, but...

697
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,458
sometimes I feel like...

698
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,250
I can't forgive them...

699
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,291
for leaving me all alone.

700
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,666
I'm jealous of you.

701
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,500
You're lucky to be a foster child.

702
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,500
If you had no relatives,

703
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:31,500
then the folks
who took you in as a daughter

704
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,791
must be truly kindhearted people.

705
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,583
Then I'll tell you a big secret.

706
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:55,583
It's about my foster parents.
They're good to me and they're kind.

707
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:01,375
I'm not their real child,
yet they raised me, which I appreciate.

708
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:06,458
But you see, I saw it one day.

709
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:10,000
They're paid to look after me.

710
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,625
Paid?

711
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,541
I found a letter from the government.

712
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:21,791
It said they were increasing
the subsidy for me.

713
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,416
I'm sure there's a reason--

714
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,333
I don't care!

715
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:33,791
They wouldn't get money
if I were their real child.

716
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:39,208
They get paid
because I'm not their real child.

717
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:46,916
Even worse... they hide it from me.

718
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,041
I see.

719
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:55,416
But that doesn't mean
Auntie doesn't love you.

720
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,166
No! Don't you see?

721
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,416
None of the other families
receive money. Just us!

722
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:07,916
She always looks worried
that I might find out.

723
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,958
And I hate myself for thinking like this.

724
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:16,083
I... just can't... believe...

725
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:18,125
in anything anymore.

726
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:31,041
Anna, it's okay to cry.

727
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,125
Just know that I love you.

728
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:39,541
I love you more than any girl
I've ever known.

729
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:45,333
Then you tell me your secret.

730
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,833
A long time ago,
I went mushrooming with Father.

731
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:57,208
Nowadays, I hardly see my parents.

732
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,916
Mother's usually travelling.

733
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:09,500
Because of work,
Father's home only twice a year.

734
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:15,333
Usually, Nan and the twin maids
are the only ones home.

735
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,750
With me.

736
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,916
I slip out while they're gossiping.

737
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:26,250
And look how free I get to be!

738
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:32,875
It's so lovely when my parents come home.

739
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:35,166
They host parties!

740
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:38,208
Like the other day.

741
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,708
With my amazing parents

742
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:45,458
and many people there, it's delightful.

743
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:49,708
I get to wear new dresses and dance, too.

744
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:56,416
That's when I feel
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

745
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,125
I see.

746
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:13,958
Tell me, Anna.
Will you be my friend forever?

747
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,750
Yes.

748
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,541
I'm your friend forever.

749
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,458
Right?

750
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:26,458
Nan's always in a bad mood.

751
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:31,166
She yanks me by the arm,
brushes my hair very hard...

752
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,250
No one thinks I'm being bullied.

753
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,750
But it really hurts.

754
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,958
Enough to cry.

755
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:43,958
The maids love to frighten me.

756
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,541
They threatened me all the time.

757
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,833
"Naughty kids get locked up in the silo

758
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,291
where ghosts suck out their souls,"
they said.

759
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:58,250
You mean, the silo on the hill?

760
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:01,791
Once, they actually took me there.

761
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:03,583
No!

762
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:06,541
They dragged me all the way to the silo.

763
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,833
I thought I'd die of fright.

764
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:10,666
Then suddenly,

765
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:14,875
just as we got there, the sky
went dark and a storm broke out.

766
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,833
The maids were terrified,
so we didn't go inside.

767
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:26,291
I can endure anything else.

768
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,166
Anything but the silo.

769
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,958
I have never heard such a terrible thing!

770
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,208
I hope the maids and Nan
get struck by lightning!

771
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:43,291
Hasn't anyone ever tried to frighten you?

772
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:46,708
Never. Definitely not on purpose.

773
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:50,250
You're lucky.

774
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:53,583
I wish I was you.

775
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,750
Our castle...

776
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:02,541
Poor Marnie.

777
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,625
I love you so much.

778
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,083
More than anyone I've known.

779
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:11,791
Thank you.

780
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:21,250
It's funny. It's like we traded places.

781
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,583
How true.

782
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,583
The tide's coming in.

783
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:36,750
Hey, let's go to the silo together.

784
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,958
The ghosts must be a lie.
Let's go make sure.

785
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:46,250
Tomorrow... No, let's go right now.

786
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,791
I don't care who Marnie really is.

787
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:00,333
I just want to help her.

788
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:14,000
Are you okay, Marnie?

789
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:18,416
Yes, I'm sure
I'll be all right if I'm with you...

790
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:20,291
Kazuhiko.

791
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,833
Anna!

792
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,541
Perfect timing! I found it!

793
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:48,583
The rest of the diary. Come to my place.

794
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,541
Marnie...

795
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,583
I'm sorry. Another time.

796
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,583
What? But it's a major discovery...

797
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,208
It's going to rain!

798
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,458
Who is it?

799
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,208
Is someone there?

800
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,958
Marnie!

801
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:09,833
So you did go ahead.
Don't scare me like that.

802
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:13,666
Marnie.

803
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,791
Are you okay? Why did you--

804
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:20,791
Kazuhiko!

805
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:25,375
I'm scared. I heard somebody below.

806
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:29,291
I thought I'd die of fright. Kazuhiko...

807
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,500
What're you saying? I'm Anna.
Pull yourself together.

808
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,041
Anna... Anna!

809
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:40,125
I don't want to be humiliated.

810
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,791
But I haven't the courage.

811
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,041
Oh, Anna...

812
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:47,041
You do have courage. You came here.

813
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,375
Let's go home.

814
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,750
Wait!

815
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:12,208
It's just the wind. Let's go.

816
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,791
We'll go home together.

817
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,166
No...

818
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,291
Anna, come back here.

819
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,666
Anna!

820
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:41,666
We got all the way up here.
I'm sure we can make it down.

821
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,000
I'll go first, so follow me.

822
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,666
No, don't leave me!

823
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,666
No!

824
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:04,333
Marnie!

825
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:08,166
Let's go over there.

826
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:24,208
I'm cold... So cold...

827
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,208
Oh Anna, I'm scared... I'm scared...

828
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:35,958
Don't worry,
we'll be fine if we're together.

829
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:39,208
You did well, Marnie.

830
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:22,250
Are you okay?

831
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,750
Kazuhiko!

832
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,625
I thought you'd never come.

833
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,916
I... I...

834
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:40,625
Let's go home.

835
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,625
Marnie?

836
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:10,958
Marnie!

837
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,541
Marnie!

838
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,958
Marnie... You left me behind!

839
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,708
Even you!

840
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:08,666
Kazuhiko... Kazuhiko...

841
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,791
Kazuhiko's all over this diary.

842
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,958
"Kazuhiko is trying
to take me to the silo."

843
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,791
Silo...

844
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:23,583
Yes?

845
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,833
Mom cooked some corn.

846
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,958
-Hurry or it'll be gone.
-Wait!

847
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,458
Why go out on a night like this?

848
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:36,416
It's not safe.

849
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,291
My friend might be caught in the rain.
What if she gets pneumonia?

850
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:46,708
Is that...

851
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:48,958
Anna!

852
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Are you okay?

853
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,166
So cruel...

854
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,166
Anna?

855
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:00,958
So cruel, Marnie...

856
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,083
She has a high fever!

857
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:04,500
I'll go get some help.

858
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,000
Anna.

859
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,333
Anna?

860
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,666
Anna...

861
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,500
How's she doing?

862
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,375
Her fever's not coming down.

863
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:30,375
She did get a shot earlier.

864
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:32,208
I see.

865
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:44,875
So cruel...

866
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:50,541
Marnie, how could you?

867
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,875
I won't forgive you.

868
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,375
Leaving me behind without a word.

869
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:28,375
Anna! My dear Anna!

870
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:34,416
Marnie! How could you leave me behind?

871
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,750
Why did you betray me?

872
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,750
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to leave you all alone.

873
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:42,750
But...

874
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:48,375
But at that moment, you weren't there.

875
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
What do you mean?

876
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:54,291
Oh, Anna, I...

877
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,500
I can't stay here any longer.

878
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,125
I have to say goodbye to you.

879
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:06,208
So please, Anna,
please tell me you forgive me!

880
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:12,041
Anna...

881
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,625
Of course, I forgive you!

882
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,375
I love you, Marnie!

883
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:23,000
And I won't forget you!

884
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:26,083
I'll never forget you! Ever!

885
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,166
Anna.

886
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,791
Sayaka's here for you.

887
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,291
Thanks.

888
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,958
You could see her in your room.

889
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,750
No, it's nice outside.

890
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:33,291
THE VIEW HERE IS BEAUTIFUL.
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU. ANNA

891
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,541
Sayaka.

892
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:38,125
Here, a get-well gift.

893
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,583
Thanks.

894
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,541
Also...

895
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:47,791
This is what made me think
you might be at the silo.

896
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,958
What is it?

897
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:52,166
The rest of the diary
you promised to read.

898
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:56,333
I'm having trouble remembering.

899
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:57,916
I impressed myself.

900
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:02,416
I found a clue in this painting
that was behind the cupboard.

901
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,916
Maybe I'm psychic.

902
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:08,083
Turn it over.

903
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,416
Hisako!

904
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:20,583
Hisako!

905
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:39,125
Please, will you tell us about Marnie?

906
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:40,625
But...

907
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,625
it's a rather sad story.

908
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,750
I'm ready for it.

909
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:53,458
It was a long time ago.

910
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:58,791
I used to play at the marsh house often.

911
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:03,208
Marnie and I were very little.

912
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,541
It's a bear!

913
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:05,916
Let me see.

914
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:09,458
This is Daddy. Isn't he dashing?

915
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,250
Marnie loved to boast

916
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,916
about her glamorous parents
and their extravagant parties.

917
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,458
But the truth is, she was being neglected.

918
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,375
Goodbye, Marnie.

919
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:29,958
That poor child...

920
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:35,166
No, don't leave me, Mommy! Don't go!

921
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,208
It seemed like even the maids
were bullying her.

922
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:40,291
That's awful!

923
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,375
Later, Marnie moved to Sapporo

924
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:47,291
and married Kazuhiko,
her childhood friend.

925
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:54,125
With her family torn apart
and feeling lost,

926
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,791
he was there to support her.

927
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:02,541
I'm glad. So Kazuhiko was a good man.

928
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:07,333
Two years later, Emily was born.

929
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:13,666
At last, in the warm household
she'd always wanted, Marnie was happy.

930
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:19,833
I didn't see Marnie
for many years after that.

931
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:22,833
The next time was...

932
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:27,000
a few years after Kazuhiko
had died of an illness.

933
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,000
By then,

934
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:37,041
Marnie was in a sanatorium
due to the shock of his death.

935
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,875
Sanatorium?

936
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,000
A place where you go to get better.

937
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,583
What happened to Emily?

938
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:51,250
Marnie's parents had died,
leaving no one to look after her.

939
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:58,583
So for elementary school,
she was sent to a boarding school.

940
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:12,083
By the time she returned at age 13,
she'd become a different person.

941
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,958
Emily!

942
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:16,750
She was willful and independent.

943
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,250
She knew Marnie was ill,

944
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:23,791
but she still resented her
for sending her away.

945
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:27,750
You think that makes you more motherly?

946
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:31,500
I want you to live the way
you wish, but...

947
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,208
you need to...

948
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:36,541
They never did make up after that.

949
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,500
As your mother--

950
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,625
I've never thought of you as a mother.

951
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:45,958
Emily ran away and soon got married.

952
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,291
She was expecting, you see.

953
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,000
But...

954
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:18,833
One day, Emily and her husband
died in a car accident.

955
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:24,625
I heard Marnie took their child in.

956
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:31,833
She was determined to never
let this child be lonely.

957
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:34,500
But...

958
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,625
she never got over losing Emily.

959
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:44,375
She became very ill
and died the following year.

960
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:49,708
That was about ten years ago.

961
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm sorry, it's a sad story.

962
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:00,708
No, thank you very much.

963
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:05,375
Marnie adored that mansion.

964
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,375
She loved seeing the marsh
from her window.

965
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:16,875
She said it felt like
the birds spoke to her.

966
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,625
She had a lonely life,

967
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,875
but she lived it fully.

968
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:28,416
She always had a smile on her face.
She was determined to be happy.

969
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:33,333
So you've met Marnie, too.

970
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:56,708
I wish we could've played more, Anna.

971
01:30:57,083 --> 01:31:00,083
The plan was always
for me to stay just for the summer.

972
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:02,958
Will you come back next summer?

973
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,750
I'm sure I will. I'll write you.

974
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,958
I'll write you, too.

975
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:16,666
I put the diary and painting
back where I found them.

976
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,791
Good, it's for the best.

977
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:21,291
I haven't told my family.

978
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:23,958
Let's keep it our secret.

979
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,291
How funny...

980
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:32,916
Marnie brought us together.

981
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:34,791
That's true.

982
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,791
Marnie...

983
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:45,625
The girl trapped behind the blue window...

984
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,000
That was long ago.

985
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:57,583
Exactly, he does it to save her life.

986
01:31:57,666 --> 01:31:59,083
I love that part.

987
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:02,166
Ah, now I want to read it all over again.

988
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,750
I'll lend you the sequel.

989
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,166
Anna!

990
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:11,333
Auntie!

991
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:15,500
Anna...

992
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,750
Hey, be careful!

993
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,166
Sorry, sorry.

994
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:30,000
Auntie's here.

995
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:33,708
Ah, Yoriko, you're here.

996
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:38,291
Thank you for everything.

997
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:41,708
She's doing well, and even made a friend.

998
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:44,083
How can I ever repay you?

999
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:48,041
Oh, no. We didn't do anything at all.

1000
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,208
Anna is a good girl.

1001
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,541
It was like having our own daughter back.

1002
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:55,541
She's welcome anytime.

1003
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,541
Thank you.

1004
01:32:57,625 --> 01:32:58,875
Let's talk inside.

1005
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:05,208
I'm impressed.
You didn't call us once!

1006
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,416
I'm all packed.

1007
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,250
Anna.

1008
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:24,750
Yes?

1009
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:29,375
There's something I need to tell you.

1010
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:36,083
We receive monthly subsidies
to cover your expenses.

1011
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:37,875
We receive money.

1012
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:41,750
I've long hesitated to tell you, but--

1013
01:33:41,833 --> 01:33:44,000
-It's okay.
-But believe me...

1014
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,916
Whether or not we receive money,

1015
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,125
it doesn't change our love for you.

1016
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,083
I already knew.

1017
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:55,208
I'm happy you told me about it.

1018
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,291
Anna!

1019
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:04,375
I've been looking at the photos you sent.

1020
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:06,625
Photos?

1021
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:11,708
Oh, while you were away
I was looking at old albums

1022
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,375
and found this picture.

1023
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:14,958
Do you remember?

1024
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,375
It's that mansion.

1025
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:23,000
When you first came to us,
you wouldn't let it go.

1026
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,500
I was told at the orphanage

1027
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,625
it belonged to your grandmother.

1028
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:38,125
MY BELOVED HOME - MARNIE

1029
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:40,500
Marnie!

1030
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:21,541
So that's who she was.

1031
01:35:24,041 --> 01:35:25,041
Anna.

1032
01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:32,875
And so I was in the silo all night.

1033
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:35,708
I was very frightened.

1034
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:38,875
That's when your grandpa came.

1035
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:42,875
He encouraged me, saying I did well.

1036
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:47,125
I've overcome many frightening things.

1037
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:48,875
And so will you, Anna.

1038
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,208
After all,

1039
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:56,208
you're my one and only grandchild.

1040
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:00,250
Grandma...

1041
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,250
Excuse me.

1042
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,291
Anna.

1043
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,791
I'm sorry for what I said.

1044
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:57,458
Next year, you better join us
to pick up the trash.

1045
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:05,958
A friend?

1046
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:07,291
Maybe.

1047
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,500
Hisako!

1048
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,333
Anna.

1049
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:23,458
I'm going home to Sapporo now.

1050
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:24,875
Is that right?

1051
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:29,125
But your face tells me
something good happened.

1052
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:32,750
Yes, I'm really happy now.

1053
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:33,875
Good.

1054
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:37,208
Um, this is my mother.

1055
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:41,625
Thank you for being kind to Anna.

1056
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:44,208
Oh no, it was my pleasure.

1057
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:47,125
Let's draw together again.

1058
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,125
Yes.

1059
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:51,458
I'll write you.
I have some amazing news.

1060
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:52,625
Goodbye.

1061
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:56,875
Thank you very much.

1062
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:03,833
Amazing news?

1063
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, I'll tell you later.

1064
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:08,000
Oh, why not now?

1065
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:09,916
I promise I'll tell you.

1066
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:25,083
Toichi! Sayaka! Goodbye!

1067
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:31,208
THE END

1068
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
