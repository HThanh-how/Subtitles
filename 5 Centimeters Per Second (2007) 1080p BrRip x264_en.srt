00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,466
5 Centimeters Per Second

2
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,260
Episode 1

3
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:12,304
You know...

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,848
I've heard it's 5 centimeters per second.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,642
Huh? What is?

6
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,061
The speed at which cherry
blossom petals fall.

7
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,063
5 centimeters per second.

8
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,357
Hmm...

9
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:25,360
You sure know a lot about
that stuff, Akari.

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,697
Say...

11
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:31,366
Doesn't it remind you of snow?

12
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,493
You think so?

13
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,496
Hey!

14
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,540
Wait up!

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,339
Akari!

16
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,339
Takaki!

17
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,805
I hope we can watch the cherry blossoms
together again next year!

18
00:00:56,683 --> 00:01:04,683
Tale of Cherry Blossoms

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,319
Dear Takaki Tono,

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,739
It's been a long time.

21
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,579
It gets pretty hot during
the summer here,

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,665
In 1900, at the age of thirty-three,
but it's better than
it was in Tokyo.

23
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:28,005
Looking back, though, I still enjoyed
those muggy Tokyo summers.
Soseki Natsume was sent to Great Britain
for a little over two years to study...

24
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,716
Asphalt hot enough to melt...

25
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,052
Skyscrapers that almost shimmered...

26
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,889
And frigid air conditioning
in the stores and subway.

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,810
We last saw each other at our
grade school graduation.

28
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,771
Pick up the pace!
It's been six months.

29
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:44,439
Shimada!

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,399
Run! Faster!
Say, Takaki...

31
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,903
Do you still remember me?

32
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,991
Dear Takaki,

33
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:56,618
Student Council

34
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,077
Thanks for replying.

35
00:01:58,078 --> 00:01:59,579
I was happy to get your letter.

36
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:04,542
Summer's over and the autumn
leaves here are gorgeous.

37
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:08,963
The day before yesterday, I pulled
out my first sweater of the year.

38
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,465
Takaki.

39
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,633
Yeah?

40
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,551
Whatcha got? A love letter?

41
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,594
No.

42
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,096
Sorry to make you do all the work.

43
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,555
No problem. It didn't take that long.

44
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,307
Thanks.

45
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,225
Say, are you really moving?

46
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,143
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,560
At the end of the school year.

48
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,437
Where to?

49
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,855
Kagoshima. My parents.

50
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:27,690
Oh...

51
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,857
I'll miss you.

52
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:31,443
I have to wake up early
these days for my club,

53
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:34,030
so I'm writing this letter on the train.

54
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,949
I got my hair cut the other day.

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,701
It's so short my ears stick out.

56
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:40,662
You probably

57
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,455
Friday's forecast calls for cloudy
skies with a chance of sunshine.
wouldn't recognize
me if you saw me now.

58
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,536
Northern Kanto will see...
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

59
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:54,299
Dear Akari Shinohara,

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,930
I'm sure you're also changing
too, little by little.

61
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,820
Dear Takaki,

62
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:18,158
How have you been doing
as the weather grows cold?

63
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,873
It's already snowed
here a few times.

64
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:30,170
Whenever it does, I have to
really bundle up to go to school.

65
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:33,797
It hasn't snowed in Tokyo yet, has it?

66
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:39,387
Even though I've moved, I'm still in
the habit of checking Tokyo's weather.

67
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,559
Maybe it'll rain...

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,686
Practicing indoors won't
be any better.

69
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,981
Hey, you guys ever
been to Tochigi?

70
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,274
Huh? Where?

71
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,317
Tochigi.

72
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,401
Nope.

73
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,861
Know how to get there?

74
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:56,945
Beats me...

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,323
Bullet train?

76
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:00,408
It's pretty far...

77
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:03,494
Rookies!

78
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,494
Yes!

79
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,622
Three laps to go!

80
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,415
Fight-o! Fight-o!

81
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,337
I was surprised to hear that
you're the one moving this time.

82
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:17,341
Visiting the Sea of Japan in Winter
We' re both used to switching
schools by now,

83
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,551
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
but Kagoshima's a little...

84
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,846
...farther than usual, I guess.

85
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:28,478
The fact that you'll be so far away that
I can't just hop on a train to go see you...

86
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:32,941
...makes me a little sad, I have to say.

87
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,651
Iwafune
I wish the very best

88
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,904
for you at your new home.

89
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,921
Dear Takaki,

90
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm so glad that we've promised
to meet on March 4th.

91
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,636
It's been a year since
we last saw each other.

92
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,681
I'm getting a little nervous.

93
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,565
There's a giant cherry
tree where I live.

94
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,985
Come spring, its petals...

95
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,447
...will probably fall at
5 centimeters per second.

96
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:28,413
I hope that spring arrives
the same time you do.

97
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,848
Wanna stop somewhere?

98
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,725
I dunno... It's raining.

99
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,477
The forecast said we'll have
snow by nightfall.

100
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,979
Yeah? No wonder it's so cold.

101
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,980
Gotokuji 3:54 PM Departure

102
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,032
Takaki, let's head to practice.

103
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,033
Sure.

104
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,704
Actually, I'll have to skip out today.

105
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,872
Getting ready to move?

106
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:12,914
Something like that.

107
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,916
Sorry.

108
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,587
Shinjuku Omiya Oyama Iwafune
Saikyo Line Ryomo Line
Utsunomiya Line
Here!
Chugga-

Chugga
Saitama!
Highway!
So far...
I appreciate you coming all
the way to the station near me.

109
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,588
- Really?
- No doubt about it.
It's a long trip, though,
so please be careful.

110
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,887
I'll be waiting in the station
at seven as planned.

111
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,515
About to arrive...

112
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,033
It began snowing in the afternoon...

113
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,787
...on the day we were supposed to meet.

114
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:53,915
Oh!

115
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,499
Look, Takaki.

116
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,542
It's Chobi the cat.

117
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,836
He's always hanging out here, huh?

118
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,797
But he's all alone today.

119
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,757
What happened to Mimi?

120
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,593
You must be lonely.

121
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:17,938
How's that book?

122
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,064
Pretty good.

123
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,650
I read about four billion years'
worth last night.

124
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,692
How far are you?

125
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,528
I'm at the part where
Anomalocaris start showing up.

126
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,289
- The Cambrian Period!
- The Cambrian Period!

127
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,533
I love the Hallucigenia.

128
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,700
They look like this.

129
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,119
Yeah, I see the resemblance.

130
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,870
What's your favorite?

131
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:34,913
The Opabinia guess.

132
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,624
Oh, the one with five eyes.

133
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,838
I believed that Akari and
I were kindred spirits.

134
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,235
I would like everyone to meet Takaki Tono.
Takaki
Tono
It was one year after I moved to Tokyo...

135
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,051
that Akari

136
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:49,511
This is your new classmate,
Akari
Shinohara
joined our class.

137
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,512
Akari Shinohara.

138
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,807
We were both small and prone to illness;

139
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,810
preferring the library to playing outdoors.

140
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,312
Judith Worthy
Le Guin
Garden in the Sky
A Wizard of Earthsea
Lewis
Prince Caspian
Akari Shinonara
Takaki Tono
Takaki Tono
Akari Shinonara Takaki Tono
Akari Shinonara
It was only natural for us to grow close,

141
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,522
though we were

142
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:01,315
Akari
Takaki
Just married
Perfect couple
teased by our

143
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:02,899
classmates as a result.

144
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,943
But...

145
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:10,741
It didn't bother us, because
we had each other.

146
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,411
Wow.

147
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,707
I thought we'd eventually go
to the same middle school.

148
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,084
I thought we'd always
be together.

149
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,005
For some reason,
I honestly believed that.

150
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,261
Shinjuku. Shinjuku. This is the final stop.

151
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,805
Please take caution...

152
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,768
You can transfer here to the JR line,
Keio line, or the subway.

153
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,025
That was the first time I'd gone to
Shinjuku Station by myself,

154
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:48,863
and the first time I'd ever
ridden those trains.

155
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,663
My heart wouldn't stop pounding.

156
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,001
I was on my way...

157
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,504
...to see Akari.

158
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,636
How'd it go with that guy?

159
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:13,678
Who?

160
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,013
Y'know, the one from Nishi-Sho?

161
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,056
Ew. I've got

162
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,891
We'll soon be stopping at
- ...better taste than that.
- What?

163
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,935
Musashi-Urawa.Musashi-Urawa.

164
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,854
At Musashi-Urawa, there will be...

165
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:27,609
There will be a four-minute delay while
we wait for an express train.

166
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,947
Passengers needing to reach Yonohommachi
and Omiya quickly should transfer...

167
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:56,221
Um... My name is Akari Shinohara.

168
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,931
Um...

169
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,517
Is Takaki there?

170
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,269
It's Akari.

171
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,939
Huh? You're moving?

172
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,108
What about Nishi Middle?

173
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,652
You were already accepted.

174
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,656
I'm being transferred to a
public school in Tochigi.

175
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,741
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,828
No, there's no reason
for you to apologize.

177
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,373
I asked if I could stay with
my aunt in Katsushika,

178
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,253
but they said I'm not old enough.

179
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,671
I see.

180
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,672
It's okay.

181
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,633
You don't...

182
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:36,929
I'm sorry...

183
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:42,100
I'd pressed the phone
against my ear so hard...

184
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,437
...that I could feel
Akari's pain through it.

185
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,316
But I couldn't do
anything for her.

186
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,156
That was a good restaurant.

187
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,617
- Yeah. See you later.
- Yeah.
The transfer terminal was

188
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:01,328
filled with people on their way home.

189
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,582
Everybody's shoes were
soaked by the snow.

190
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:09,837
I could smell the cold, unique
scent of urban snow in the air.

191
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,714
Attention, all passengers.

192
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,051
The Utsonomiya line bound
for Oyama and Utsunomiya...

193
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,262
...has been delayed by snow
by approximately eight minutes.

194
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,307
We apologize for any potential inconvenience,

195
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:26,227
And request your patience
and understanding at this time.
Until that moment, I hadn't even considered

196
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,147
that the train might be late.

197
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,776
My anxiety suddenly
began to grow.

198
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:41,076
Due to snowy conditions, this train is
running approximately ten minutes late.

199
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:44,413
We apologize for any
potential inconvenience.

200
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,960
Shortly after passing Omiya Station,

201
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,131
I began to notice how there
weren't many buildings around.

202
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,270
Next stop, Kuki. Kuki.

203
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,234
We apologize for the
delay in our arrival.

204
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,239
Passengers transferring to the
Tobu-Isesaki line should use Gate 5.

205
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:25,663
Due to other delays, this train will be
stopping at this station for ten minutes.

206
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,082
We apologize for any
potential inconvenience,

207
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,877
and request your patience
and understanding at this time.

208
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,547
Sorry about that.

209
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:40,428
Due to other delays, this train will be
stopping at this station for ten minutes.

210
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,013
We apologize for any
potential inconvenience,

211
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,254
and request your patience
and understanding at this time.

212
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,247
Nogi. Nogi.

213
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,167
Once again, we offer
our sincerest apologies.

214
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:16,588
Due to other delays, this train will be
stopping at this station for the time being.

215
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:17,881
We apologize for any

216
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,340
potential inconvenience,
I couldn't believe

217
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,302
and request your patience
and understanding at this time.
how far apart the stations were,

218
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,891
and how long the train
stopped at each one.

219
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,518
Nogi

220
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,984
Iwafune

221
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,957
The unfamiliar snowy
plain outside my window,

222
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,001
the agonizingly
slow crawl of time,

223
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,003
and the uncomfortable
hunger pangs,

224
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,924
only made me feel more helpless.

225
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,093
It was past our meeting time.

226
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:08,098
Akari had probably started to worry.

227
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,061
To Akari

228
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,479
On that day...

229
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,481
The day when Akari called me...

230
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:20,568
I had no comforting words to offer her,

231
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,239
though she was clearly suffering
more than I was.

232
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,574
I was so ashamed of myself.

233
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:32,330
As we humbly reflect upon

234
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,915
the efforts

235
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,837
of our teachers...
Well... I guess this is goodbye.

236
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,338
Let's go

237
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,419
- ...somewhere over spring break!
- And do what?
I received the first letter from
Akari six months later,

238
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,929
during my first summer in middle school.

239
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,891
I memorized her every word.

240
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:57,356
Two weeks before we were to meet,
I began writing a letter to hand to her.

241
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,568
There were so many, many things...

242
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,988
...that I wanted to tell her,
had to tell her...

243
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,614
We apologize for the long wait.

244
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,285
Service to Utsunomiya
will continue momentarily.

245
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,549
Oyama. Oyama.

246
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,177
Passengers for the Tohoku
bullet train must transfer here.

247
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,932
Boarding for the Tohoku bullet train
to Morioka will be at Platform 1.

248
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,478
Passengers bound for Tokyo
should board at Platform 5.

249
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,605
Boarding for the

250
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,440
Mito line
will be at Platform 15.
Attention, all passengers.

251
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:46,071
The Ryomo line has been
delayed by heavy snowfall.

252
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,366
We apologize for any
potential inconvenience,

253
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,913
and request your patience and
understanding until the train arrives.

254
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,622
The next train

255
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:59,417
I had no choice but to make my way
bound for Takasaki
is expected to depart at 8:15 PM.

256
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,295
To the station where
Akari was waiting.

257
00:16:55,474 --> 00:17:00,478
The Ashikaga-Maebashi train bound for
Takasaki is now arriving at Platform 8.

258
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,439
Please remain behind the line.

259
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,556
Attention, all passengers.

260
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:41,602
This train will be stopping due to
delays caused by the snow.

261
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,105
We apologize for any inconvenience.

262
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:47,026
We are presently unable to determine
when service will resume.

263
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,152
Again.

264
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:53,614
The train will be stopping due to
scheduling delays caused by the snow.

265
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,783
We apologize for any inconvenience.

266
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,704
We are presently unable to determine
when service will resume.

267
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,208
Dear Takaki,

268
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,335
How are you doing?

269
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,254
I have to wake up early for my club,

270
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,673
so I'm writing this letter on the train.

271
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,176
When I read Akari's letters,

272
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,138
for some reason I always
pictured her alone.

273
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,143
The train ended up parked out there,

274
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,689
in the middle of nowhere,
for two more hours.

275
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,526
Each minute felt like an eternity...

276
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,321
I could sense hovering malice...

277
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,657
...as time slowly crept by.

278
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,786
But I could only grit my teeth...

279
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:44,291
...and choke back my tears.

280
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,251
Akari...

281
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,629
I hope that...

282
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,091
...you already...

283
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,762
...went home.

284
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,198
The Ashikaga-Maebashi train bound for
Takasaki is now arriving at Platform 3.

285
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,370
This train will be stopping here
briefly due to a snow delay.

286
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,533
Akari...

287
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,856
It's so good.

288
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,565
Really?

289
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,358
It's just roasted green tea.

290
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,359
Roasted green tea?

291
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,361
Never had it.

292
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:37,863
Liar.

293
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,780
I guarantee that you have.

294
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,657
You sure?

295
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,657
Yep.

296
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,535
And, here.

297
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:48,080
I made it myself, so I can't
vouch for the taste...

298
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,416
But you can try it, if you want.

299
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,710
Thank you.

300
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,339
I'm starving.

301
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,717
How is it?

302
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,350
The best food I've ever tasted in my life.

303
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,559
Gimme a break.

304
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,685
I'm serious.

305
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,479
It's just because you're hungry.

306
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,563
You sure?

307
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,606
Yep.

308
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,234
But I'll have some too.

309
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,698
You're moving soon, right?

310
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,325
Yeah, next week.

311
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,910
Kagoshima, huh?

312
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:26,745
It's pretty far away.

313
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:27,745
Yeah.

314
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,915
Same goes for Tochigi, though.

315
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,793
You're stranded out here now.

316
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,797
We'll be closing up soon.

317
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,383
- There won't be any
more trains coming in.
- Oh, okay.

318
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,593
It's snowing hard. You kids be careful.

319
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,594
We will.

320
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,453
Look, there's the tree.

321
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,122
The one you mentioned in your letter?

322
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:12,958
Yeah, the cherry tree.

323
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,465
Say...

324
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,636
Doesn't it remind you of snow?

325
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:33,811
Yeah, it does.

326
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,449
In that moment,

327
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:51,913
I think I realized where eternity,
the heart, and the soul, truly exist.

328
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:57,043
It was like I was sharing every experience
from my thirteen years on this planet.

329
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,671
But then, in the next moment...

330
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,549
...I felt unbearably sad.

331
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,848
What was I supposed to do with
Akari's warmth, her soul?

332
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,853
I didn't know the answer.

333
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,692
And that was when it became clear to me...

334
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,528
...that we wouldn't always be together.

335
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:29,493
We still had our entire
lives before us.

336
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,371
So much time left...

337
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,959
But soon enough,

338
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,587
my worries melted away,

339
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:46,009
leaving only the sensation
of Akari's soft lips on mine.

340
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,904
We spent that night...

341
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,699
...in a small shed on the
outskirts of a farm.

342
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,868
We wrapped ourselves
up in an old blanket...

343
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,121
...and talked away the hours...

344
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,749
...until we finally fell asleep.

345
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,211
In the morning,
the trains were running again,

346
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,506
and we said our goodbyes.

347
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,968
Um...

348
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:29,969
Takaki.

349
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,682
Takaki...

350
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,768
I know you'll be just fine.

351
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:38,894
I know it!

352
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:39,938
Thanks...

353
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,691
Take care of yourself, Akari!

354
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,650
I'll write!

355
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,651
And call!

356
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:03,670
I never told Akari
about the letter I lost.

357
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,008
To Takaki Tono
Because a single kiss...

358
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:13,013
...was enough to make me feel
like my whole world had changed.

359
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:25,150
I longed for the ability to take
care of her, to keep her safe.

360
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,778
And as thoughts of
her consumed me,

361
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,200
I proceeded to stare
out the window.

362
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,703
Episode 1 - Tale of Cherry Blossoms
End

363
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,182
Episode 2

364
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,123
Kanae, are you going back
there after school?

365
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:04,833
Yup.

366
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:05,916
That okay with you?

367
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:06,459
Sure.

368
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,377
But don't forget to study.

369
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,378
I won't!

370
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:40,909
Okay.

371
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,342
Morning.

372
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,636
Good morning, Takaki.

373
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,012
You're sure here early.

374
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,138
So are you.

375
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,431
I'm guessing you went
down to the beach?

376
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,557
Yup.

377
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,558
You're so dedicated.

378
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,854
Not really...

379
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,648
See you later, Takaki.

380
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:11,733
Right.

381
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:14,903
Listen up.

382
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:16,654
It's decision-making time, folks.

383
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,947
This is due on Monday.

384
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,368
Make sure you discuss
it with your parents.

385
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,744
Career Plan

386
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,247
Sasaki's going to college in Tokyo.

387
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:27,706
Wow...

388
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,084
I'm shooting for a junior
college in Kumamoto.

389
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,460
What about you, Kanae?

390
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,379
Huh?

391
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,504
Um...

392
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,089
You gonna look for a job?

393
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,216
Um...

394
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,259
You don't think about
anything, do you?

395
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,969
Except your precious Takaki.

396
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,263
I bet he has a girlfriend
back in Tokyo.

397
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,307
Don't say that!

398
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,711
Still having trouble?

399
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,214
Yeah, I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.

400
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,174
Don't stress about it too much.

401
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,093
You'll be back on the waves
before you know it.

402
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,262
I wish I had your positive attitude.

403
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,098
What's the rush?

404
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,894
The way things are going, I won't have
time to tell him before we graduate.

405
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,081
Thanks, sis.

406
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,166
I can take you home.

407
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,252
It's okay. I'll go on my Cub.

408
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,654
Oh, Kanae.

409
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,573
You heading home now?

410
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:26,033
Yep. And you?

411
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,201
Yeah.

412
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,328
Wanna go together?

413
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,165
If I had a tail like a dog's,

414
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,461
it would've wagged so hard,
my glee would've been plain as day.

415
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:42,508
But my sigh of relief over
not being a dog...

416
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,470
...was also a sigh of disgust
at how stupid I sounded.

417
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,554
Despite all that,

418
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,642
I was overjoyed to be
riding home with Takaki.

419
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:54,770
From the moment I met him,

420
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,355
2nd Year, Class 1
I could tell Takaki was

421
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,483
This is Takaki Tono from Tokyo.
Please introduce yourself.
somehow different from the other boys.

422
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,484
Takaki Tono

423
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,027
I'm Takaki Tono.

424
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,571
I'm used to moving around
because of my parents' jobs,

425
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,782
but I'm not used to living
on this island yet.

426
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,325
I hope to get to know everyone.

427
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,661
I fell in love with him the
day he came to our school.

428
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,996
I wanted to go to the same
high school as him...

429
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:16,458
Okay, let's move on to the next request.
...so I worked my butt off to get accepted.

430
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,001
Every time I saw him,

431
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:22,005
- There's nothing to do out here.
- It's still better than Tokyo.
I fell deeper in love.

432
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,382
I was so scared...

433
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,175
And every day hurt...

434
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,427
But I was so happy
whenever I saw him...

435
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,639
I couldn't help myself.

436
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,518
You're so predictable.

437
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,603
I love the way it tastes.

438
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,565
You're always so sincere.

439
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,566
Yeah.

440
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,070
I'll wait outside.

441
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,196
Okay...

442
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:47,322
Just this, please.

443
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,199
That'll be ninety yen.

444
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,118
Here you go.

445
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,202
Thanks for shopping here.

446
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,297
Welcome back.

447
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,257
What'd you get?

448
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:05,174
Well...

449
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,238
I thought about it, and decided
to stick with this yogurt drink.
I would spot Takaki texting
someone from time to time.

450
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,888
And every single time,

451
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,641
Guard Earth from Space
I'd wish that it was me.

452
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:18,271
I just couldn't help myself.

453
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,406
Hi, Cub! I'm home!

454
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:32,327
That's right, Cubbie... I'm back.

455
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,265
We have an announcement
from the town council.

456
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,435
Sakai's will be the next gas
station on weekend duty.

457
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,104
Kanae Sumida from Class 3-1,

458
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,814
Mr. Ito would like to see you.

459
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,107
Please report to the guidance

460
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,788
counselor's office.
That's your girlfriend.

461
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,486
She's not my girlfriend.

462
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:11,323
Career Plan - Kanae Sumida

463
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,784
You're the only one who
hasn't turned one in.

464
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,285
I'm sorry.

465
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,662
Now look here.

466
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,163
I probably shouldn't say this,

467
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,791
but you don't need to worry
so much about it.

468
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,834
Has Ms. Sumida suggested anything?

469
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,835
No.

470
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,548
If you can't make up your mind,

471
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,801
you could always go to an
in-prefecture junior college.

472
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:31,802
But...

473
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,682
My sister has nothing
to do with this.

474
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
I mean...

475
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,788
I can't even surf, after
I begged her to teach me...

476
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:02,624
I can't tell the boy
I like how I feel...

477
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,045
I can't do anything...

478
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,196
Thanks for shopping here.

479
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,531
Oh, you're welcome.

480
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,658
Bye.

481
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,563
Whenever I was around Takaki,

482
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:10,234
I would get a pain in my chest.

483
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,402
Takaki.

484
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:13,403
Kanae?

485
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:14,280
What's up?

486
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
How'd you find me?

487
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,243
I saw your scooter, so I stopped.
Do you mind?

488
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,578
Nah, it's fine.

489
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:22,913
I'm happy to see you.

490
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:25,582
I missed you in the
parking lot today.

491
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,875
Same here.

492
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,419
He's so nice.

493
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:32,423
So nice it sometimes
makes me want to cry.

494
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,552
Say, are you applying
to any colleges?

495
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:40,680
Yeah, I'm aiming for one in Tokyo.

496
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,265
Tokyo?

497
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,475
I see...

498
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,936
I'm not surprised.

499
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,895
Why's that?

500
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:49,857
You just look like you're
dying to get out of here.

501
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:51,858
What about you?

502
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,485
Well...

503
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,738
I have no idea what tomorrow will hold.

504
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,698
That's probably how
most people feel.

505
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,492
Yeah right!

506
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,575
You included?

507
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,576
Of course.

508
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,413
But you look like you've
got it all figured out.

509
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,290
I wish.

510
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,625
I spend all my time hesitating.

511
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,002
I struggle to do the best I can.

512
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,003
No time to relax.

513
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:13,797
Really?

514
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,425
I didn't know.

515
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,850
A paper airplane?

516
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:25,851
Yeah.

517
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,040
Detour

518
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,192
National Space Development Agency ofJapan

519
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,528
Wow...

520
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,530
I've heard it's 5 kilometers per hour.

521
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:21,531
Huh?

522
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,409
The speed at which it travels
to Minamitane's launch pad.

523
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,410
Oh.

524
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,788
They're going to launch one this
year for the first time in a while.

525
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:32,500
I know. It's headed for the
edge of the solar system.

526
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,711
The journey will take years.

527
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:57,484
You should talk to Kanae
about her future.

528
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,069
She can be so indecisive.

529
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,403
She'll be fine.

530
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,365
She's not a kid anymore.

531
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:08,371
I used to be just like her.

532
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,748
Guess what, Cub.

533
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,751
Takaki doesn't know what
he wants to do either.

534
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,046
He's just like me.

535
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,303
It was a journey more lonely
than I could possibly imagine.

536
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,932
Plunging headlong through
impenetrable darkness,

537
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:32,311
with next to no chance of spotting
a single atom of hydrogen...

538
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:38,484
A desperate search of the abyss,
for the secrets of this world...

539
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:47,660
How far will we go in search
of those answers?

540
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,746
How far are we able to?

541
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:05,427
Subject: What I dreamt this morning
"I was walking through a field on
another planet with that same girl.
As usual, I couldn't see her face.
But it all felt very familiar."

542
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:05,845
Save message?

543
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,305
No

544
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:14,478
When did I start writing messages
I could never send?

545
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,267
Kanae, did you figure out
what you want to do?

546
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:57,187
No, not yet.

547
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,229
But it's okay.

548
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,731
I've decided something.

549
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,858
I'll just take everything
step-by-step.

550
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:02,859
I'm off!

551
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:24,714
After that day, a number
of typhoons passed by,

552
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,802
and the island became
a little cooler each time.

553
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,723
The wind rustling the sugarcane
fields became a little chillier.

554
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:35,934
The sky felt a little higher.

555
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:38,561
The outlines of the clouds were softer,

556
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:42,775
and the students who rode their Cubs to
school began wearing light jackets.

557
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,918
My first successful attempt
to ride a wave in six months...

558
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:05,798
...came at the end of summer's warmth,
in the middle of October.

559
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:22,021
This evening's forecast calls for sunny skies,
with winds of up to 8 meters per second.

560
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:25,275
I heard Yamada asked Sasaki out.

561
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:26,985
Wow.

562
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:27,986
Huh?

563
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,904
You seem happy today, Kanae.

564
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,615
Finally make progress with Takaki?

565
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,159
Hehe.

566
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:33,951
No way!

567
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,743
Make sure you remember this formula.

568
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,120
Today's the day
It'll be on the final.

569
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,957
I tell Takaki how I feel.

570
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,172
If I can't do it on the day I rode a wave,

571
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:50,176
then it's never going to happen.

572
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:01,853
Kanae.

573
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:02,854
Ta...

574
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:05,398
Takaki...

575
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,317
You heading home now?

576
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:07,318
Yeah.

577
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:08,277
I see.

578
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,571
Let's go together.

579
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,887
Oh? You made up your
mind pretty quick today.

580
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:36,888
Yep.

581
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,146
Um...

582
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:48,983
What's wrong?

583
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,492
...being so nice to me...

584
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,493
Huh?

585
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,329
Nothing...

586
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,249
Sorry, forget it.

587
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:12,924
Having trouble?

588
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:13,884
Yeah.

589
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:14,884
That's weird.

590
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:17,263
No good?

591
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,388
Yeah...

592
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,890
The spark plug might be dead.

593
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:21,975
Was this a hand-me-down?

594
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,268
Yeah, it was my sister's.

595
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,061
Did it sputter when you accelerated?

596
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:26,105
It might have.

597
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,816
You'll have to leave it here for now.

598
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:32,193
Ask someone from your
family to pick it up later.

599
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,403
I'll walk you home.

600
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:34,363
What?

601
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:36,030
I can walk by myself.

602
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,032
You can go home.

603
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,909
It's not that far from here.

604
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,329
And I feel like walking anyway.

605
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,532
Takaki...

606
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:20,659
Please...

607
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:33,046
What's wrong?

608
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,047
I'm sorry...

609
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,299
It's nothing...

610
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm sorry...

611
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,970
Kanae?

612
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,474
Please...

613
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,727
Stop being...

614
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:48,979
...so nice to me.

615
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:28,077
We're so desperate to
reach beyond the clouds...

616
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:31,080
...that we launched these
massive objects...

617
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,376
...while we stared
off into the distance.

618
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:43,384
I think that was when I realized...

619
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,928
...what made Takaki different
from everybody else.

620
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,181
And that was also when...

621
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:51,100
...it became painfully clear...

622
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:53,353
...that he didn't truly see me.

623
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:02,321
That's why I couldn't bring myself
to tell him how I felt that day.

624
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:19,003
Takaki was a good guy...

625
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,547
An incredibly nice guy...

626
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:27,053
But he was always looking
at something beyond me.

627
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:29,348
Something very far away.

628
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,612
Takaki would never
reciprocate my feelings.

629
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,114
And yet...

630
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:48,241
And yet I was certain that...

631
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:52,036
...come tomorrow, the next day,
and every day after that,

632
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,373
I wouldn't be able to keep
myself from loving him.

633
00:47:57,334 --> 00:48:00,419
And as I drowned in thoughts of him,

634
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,340
I proceeded to cry myself to sleep.

635
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,385
Episode 2 - Cosmonaut
End

636
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:33,537
Episode 3

637
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:57,068
March 2008
2/14-22 Meeting - Sangen-Jaya
3/2 (Mon)
3/1~4 API Meeting
Specifications Finalized
4/6 API Delivered
(Mon, Tue, Sat)
Ishii
4/14 Shinjuku CG

638
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:31,761
I couldn't shake the feeling...

639
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:35,766
...that if I were to turn around,
she would do the same.

640
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:53,909
Today's last Chuo-Sobu line train
bound for Tokyo has arrived.

641
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:11,736
You should stay until New Year's.

642
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:12,820
I know.

643
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,947
But I need to get everything ready.

644
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:16,490
That's true.

645
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,701
You should cook something
nice for him.

646
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:19,536
I will.

647
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:22,538
Let us know if anything
comes up, Akari.

648
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:23,622
I'll be fine.

649
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:25,708
We'll see each other at the
wedding next month,

650
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,376
so you don't need
to worry so much.

651
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:30,417
The train is approaching the platform 2.
It's cold out. You should head home.

652
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:53,320
Last night, I had a dream
of days gone by.

653
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:57,741
Of when he and I were still children.

654
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,743
It was probably because of the letter

655
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,104
Dear Takaki Tono
I found yesterday.

656
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:50,001
"Hello, Takaki.
It's been a while. How are you?
After some thinking, I've decided
there's something I need to tell you."

657
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:54,046
Ms. Takagi, could you process this for me?

658
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:55,589
Message sent
Mr. Shirokai, you have a call on line two.

659
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,424
Miss Mizuno.

660
00:52:56,425 --> 00:52:57,550
Ah, yes?

661
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:58,717
Coming to the meeting?

662
00:52:58,718 --> 00:52:59,718
Yes.

663
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:10,938
I was just going through
the motions of life.

664
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:13,275
Sorrow was building
wherever I looked.

665
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,569
On my bedsheets.

666
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,612
On my toothbrush.

667
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,699
In my cell phone history.

668
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,307
"I still love you."

669
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,644
Said a message from the woman I'd
been with for the past three years.

670
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:55,816
"But after a thousand
message exchanges,

671
00:53:55,817 --> 00:54:00,280
our hearts have only grown
closer by 1 centimeter."

672
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,289
For the past few years,

673
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,041
I had been trying to move on.

674
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:14,752
I was grasping for something
I couldn't reach.

675
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:17,004
I didn't even know what it was.

676
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:20,382
Not knowing the root
of these violent feelings,

677
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,887
I could only slave away at my work.

678
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,555
The next thing I knew,

679
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:28,808
I felt the pain of watching
my heart go numb.

680
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:32,853
One morning,

681
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:35,981
I discovered that I had completely lost...

682
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:38,652
...those sincere feelings I once had.

683
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:41,654
I reached the end of my rope...

684
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,240
...and quit my job.

685
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,725
Last night, I had a dream.

686
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,520
A dream of days gone by.

687
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,857
In the dream, we were
still thirteen years old.

688
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:22,736
We were in the middle of a
large field blanketed by snow.

689
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:26,949
Faint artificial light shined
from houses in the distance.

690
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:31,955
"Japan's Deep Space Exploration Probe Elish
Finally Exits Solar System"
Our footprints were all that
blemished the virgin snow.

691
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,872
And...

692
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:37,501
We believed we would one day watch
the cherry blossoms together again.

693
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:40,921
Of that, we had no doubt.

694
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:42,716
Of that, we were certain.

695
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:50,138
5 <i>Centimeters Per Second
Everywhere I go, I look for you.</i>

696
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:52,057
<i>I look on platforms,</i>

697
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,975
<i>and in windows from alleys.</i>

698
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:57,979
<i>Knowing I'll never find you there.</i>

699
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,274
<i>If my wish comes true,</i>

700
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,861
<i>I'd go straight to you.</i>

701
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,698
<i>I'd do everything I ever wanted to do.</i>

702
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:14,914
<i>I'd hold you with all the power
I have gained in my life.</i>

703
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,803
<i>Anybody can help me forget my loneliness.</i>

704
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:34,684
<i>But it has to be you...</i>

705
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:38,395
<i>...because the stars are so bright.</i>

706
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,690
<i>One more time.</i>

707
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:46,069
<i>I pray for the seasons to stand still.</i>

708
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,989
<i>One more time.</i>

709
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:53,285
<i>I want to go back to those carefree days.</i>

710
00:56:53,286 --> 00:57:00,876
<i>Everywhere I go, I look for you.</i>

711
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:02,711
<i>At the intersection.</i>

712
00:57:02,712 --> 00:57:04,588
<i>In my dreams every night.</i>

713
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:08,216
<i>Knowing I'd never find you there.</i>

714
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:11,928
<i>If I could perform a miracle,</i>

715
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,307
<i>I would show you how...</i>

716
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:19,102
...I <i>am different now,
on this new morning.</i>

717
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,109
<i>I'd tell you "I love you,"
though I never could before.</i>

718
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:38,623
<i>Memories of summer
spin round and round.</i>

719
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:48,007
<i>I</i> can't even hear <i>my</i> heartbeat.

720
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:56,932
<i>Everywhere I go, I look for you.</i>

721
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,725
<i>Every morning.</i>

722
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,393
<i>In the town of Sakuragi-Cho.</i>

723
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:04,314
<i>Knowing I'd never find you there.</i>

724
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:08,151
<i>If my wish comes true,</i>

725
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,696
<i>I'd go straight to you.</i>

726
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:15,158
<i>I'd do everything I'd ever wanted to do.</i>

727
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:19,037
<i>I'd hold you with all the power
I have gained in my life.</i>

728
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:23,960
<i>I always look for signs of you.</i>

729
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,921
<i>In the shops on my travels.</i>

730
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,881
<i>Even in newspaper columns.</i>

731
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:33,468
<i>Knowing I'd never find you there.</i>

732
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:37,180
<i>If I could perform a miracle,</i>

733
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40,809
<i>I would show you how...</i>

734
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:44,229
...I <i>am different now,
on</i> a <i>new morning.</i>

735
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,149
<i>I'd tell you "I love you,"
though I never could before.</i>

736
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:55,365
<i>Everywhere I look,
I always look for your smile.</i>

737
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:57,158
<i>At the crossing,</i>

738
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,035
<i>waiting for the trains to pass.</i>

739
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:02,414
<i>Knowing I'll never find you there.</i>

740
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:06,459
<i>If I were born again,</i>

741
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,046
<i>I'd come to you.</i>

742
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,925
<i>For there's nothing I want in this world...</i>

743
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:20,766
<i>...besides your love.
Nothing else matters.</i>

744
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:43,677
The End
