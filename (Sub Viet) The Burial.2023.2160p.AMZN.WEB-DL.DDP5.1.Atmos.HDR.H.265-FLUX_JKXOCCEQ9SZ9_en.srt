{\an8}And I'm gonna tell you right now,

74
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,541
{\an8}- my client ain't no good.

75
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,083
He ain't.

76
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,791
My no-good client, Clovis Tubbs,
on the day of the accident,

77
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,291
was drunk.

78
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,458
That's right. Drunk.

79
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,166
Uh... tanked.

80
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,916
Wasted. Toe up from the flo' up.

81
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,458
Matter of fact,
you want to check the numbers?

82
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,291
The numbers say, uh,
0.4 percent blood alcohol level.

83
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,875
It's right here.

84
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,833
Inebriated, if you want to say a big word.

85
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,875
Not only that,

86
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,375
he was going through mental things.

87
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
He said he was suffering from depression.

88
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,750
Some would say that he was suicidal,
and we have the proof of that,

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,958
because when he was talking
to his therapist,

90
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,333
he'd told his therapist, "I'm feeling
so bad I wish I could get in my car

91
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,125
and ride straight into a tree."

92
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,000
But he couldn't do that.

93
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,166
My no-good client couldn't do that.
You know why?

94
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,875
His license is revoked.

95
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,666
Ain't even got a license.

96
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,166
So what'd he say?
"I'm gonna get me a bicycle

97
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,875
and I'm gonna do it that way."

98
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,125
And that's exactly what he did.

99
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,041
He got on his bicycle and rode over there
to Alberta and Vine.

100
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,916
Y'all know the liquor store
over there, huh?

101
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,416
And he got him a big old bottle of Scotch
and he downed it, and what'd he do?

102
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:57,041
Get on that bicycle and he rode straight
towards the highway, towards traffic.

103
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,541
Hmm?

104
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,958
And then, here comes Mr. Eighteen-Wheeler,

105
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,875
Finch and Company,
not paying no attention.

106
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,916
To nothing. Coming down Elm.

107
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,500
And what did he do? Bam!

108
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,500
He hit Clovis.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,708
He hit him.

110
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,375
He should be dead.

111
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
He should be dead.

112
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,791

120

Because we have the evidence.

That sound like a nap waiting to happen.

175
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,416
- Yeah. Yeah, we don't do no contract law.
I mean, hell.

176
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,958
R-Right, but look, we understand
it's not necessarily your field,

177
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,541
but perhaps you could just hear him out.

178
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,458
I think you'll find the case compelling.

179
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,666
I am a, um, funeral director

180
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
from Biloxi, Mississippi.

181
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,708
I have a business there-- Well, actually,
I have several businesses there.

182
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,125
I have eight funeral homes
and one burial insurance company.

183
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,000
<i>We are a family business,</i>

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,708
<i>and have been for over a hundred years.</i>

185
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,000
<i>And we are not about to lose that
without a fight.</i>

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
{\an8}<i>After I returned from the war,</i>

187
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,833
{\an8}<i>my father passed the business to me,</i>

188
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,208
{\an8}<i>which I considered a sacred trust.</i>

189
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,250
<i>Annette and I were blessed
with 13 children,</i>

190
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,291
<i>and we intend for them</i>

191
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,208
<i>to carry the business into the future.</i>

192
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,083
<i>But about a year ago,</i>

193
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,833
<i>I ran into some financial trouble.</i>

194
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,750
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How can I help you?

195
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,458
We're here on behalf
of the state insurance commission.

196
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,333
Mr. O'Keefe, as a registered
burial insurance broker

197
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,708
in the state of Mississippi,

198
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm sure you're aware
you're required to maintain

199
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,250
a certain minimum funds
in your account at all times.

200
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,125
Well, yes. Of course I'm aware.

201
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,500
Insurance regulators?

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,791
You gotta be kidding me.

203
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,208
What'd they say they want, exactly?

204
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,750
Truth is, I may have gotten myself
into a lot of trouble.

205
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,625
Trouble?

206
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,500
Jerry...

207
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,208
I've been your lawyer, what,
coming up on 30 years?

208
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,500
Was your friend even before that.

209
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,458
You and I both know

210
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,166
I've been in debt
up to my neck for years,

211
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,708
trying to make this business strong,

212
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,291
make it last,

213
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,791
so I have something to leave my children.

214
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,083
Let's not panic just yet.

215
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,583
I get how stressful this is,

216
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,958
but I'm pretty sure we can
find a way out of it.

217
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,291
Hold up a second.

218
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,541
Excuse me, son.

219
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,000
- Do you want another drink?
- No, no.

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,750
Whenever you get a chance,
could I get another bourbon over here?

221
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,333
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,375
So, look,

223
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,166
have you considered
selling off part of the business?

224
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,500
No.

225
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,291
Just part of it. Okay?

226
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,833
Well, I'm not saying I want to,
but if I did,

227
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,583
where would I find a buyer?

228
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Canada, actually.

229
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,458
They made an inquiry.

230
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
Loewen Group? Oh, yeah.

231
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,041
They've been on a pretty significant
acquisition spree.

232
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,416
Going all across the country,

233
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,333
buying up every independently owned
funeral chain they can get their hands on.

234
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,041
These guys, they're really big players.

235
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,583
Now, you know how I feel
about these big corporations, now.

236
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,166
Yes, I do. But all I'm saying is
it's an option.

237
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,000
And it's out there.

238
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,791
Might be a way out.

239
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,041
You could think about it.

240
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,750
Jerry.

241
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,416
Perfect timing.

242
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,125
- Hey, you need a hand with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.

243
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,625
Hey, so, listen.

244
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,083
You're sure about this, right?

245
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I've given this a lot of thought,

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,916
and I believe this is
the right thing to do for my family.

247
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,166
All righty, then.

248
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,833
Next stop, Vancouver.
You ready to go inside?

249
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,416
No, we got to wait for Hal.

250
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,333
- Who?
- I told you about Hal.

251
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,708
He's a friend of my son's from college,

252
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,208
very bright young man

253
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,458
just getting started out
as a lawyer and, uh...

254
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,041
Well, hell, here he comes now.

255
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,458
Recently passed the bar exam.

256
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,541
Hungry for experience.

257
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,291
Who, which one?

258
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,958
That tall kid?

259
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,166
Hey, hey, sorry.
So sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. Um...

260
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,333
My taxi just dropped me off
at the wrong terminal, so...

261
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,625
Oh, don't worry about it. Halbert Dockins,
I want you to meet Mike Allred.

262
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,666
Really great to meet you, Mr. Allred.

263
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,291
I'm very excited
to be a member of the team.

264
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,875
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

265
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,541
So you're a lawyer?

266
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,541
Uh, yeah.

267
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,458
Well, that's just great.
Good for you, son.

268
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,375
I'll see you guys inside.

269
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,583
Come on. We're going to Canada.

270
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,166
{\an8}
<i>I work for Ray Loewen.</i>

271
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,875
{\an8}<i>He's really looking forward
to meeting you.</i>

272
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,500
As I'm sure you can gather,

273
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,375
Ray's a very hands-on kind of guy.

274
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,375
One of the only CEOs in the industry

275
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,333
who likes to meet with
every seller personally.

276
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,791
Hey, Ray!

277
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,791
Allow me to introduce Mr. Jeremiah O'Keefe

278
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,458
- and his colleagues.
- It is a pleasure to meet you, Jerry.

279
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:23,041
So, boys, how do you like the way we do
business up here in Canada?

280
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,458
Come on on board. Get you a drink.

281
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,041
At present, we own 1,115 funeral homes,

282
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,583
427 cemeteries,

283
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,166
354 insurance companies.

284
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,791
My strategy is simple.

285
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,041
Buy as many funeral homes as I can

286
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,416
and put myself in a position

287
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,250
for what I like to call

288
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,958
the Golden Era of Death.

289
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,958
Sorry?

290
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,125
It's when all the baby boomers
across the U.S.

291
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,416
finally reach their age of demise.

292
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,916
Resulting in a minimum 60% increase

293
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,458
in death rates nationwide.

294
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,583
Do you have any idea how many people
are living in the U.S.,

295
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,833
right now,

296
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,791
over the age of 65?

297
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,166
51 million.

298
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,875
That sounds kind of cynical to me.

299
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,125
Aren't you worried
about losing sight of your customer?

300
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,208
My customer?

301
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
What customer?
My customers are dead guys.

302
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,166
I'm just kidding.

303
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,375
I'm just kidding, Jerry.

304
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,916
Look, the more funeral homes I own,

305
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,500
the more money I make,

306
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,666
the more I am able to meet the demands
of my customer.

307
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,375
And provide for his... growing needs.

308
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,333
Maybe it's time that we drop
all this chit-chat

309
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,208
and start talking about a deal.
What do you say, gentlemen?

310
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm interested to hear
what you have in mind, Ray.

311
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,083
My understanding

312
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,750
is that you're having a bit of trouble

313
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,583
with the state regulators down there.

314
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,041
How'd you come to that understanding?

315
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,291
You own... what?

316
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,750
Nine homes across the state?

317
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,875
Eight.

318
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,541
I own eight funeral homes
across the state.

319
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,791
And my insurance business, of course.

320
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,000
So what about this?

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,833
You sell me three of your homes,

322
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,250
at a fair market value
to be agreed upon later.

323
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,708
Then, not only do you get to keep

324
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,875
the bulk of your assets,

325
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,416
but it would also provide you
with more than enough fresh cash

326
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,416
to deal with the regulators.

327
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,791
Now, there's something else
I want out of this deal.

328
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,041
I make most of my profits
from selling burial insurance.

329
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,125
There's no way I can survive
if you have a monopoly

330
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
on that, too, so what I propose

331
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,208
is that I sell you
three of my funeral homes,

332
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,958
fair market value...

333
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,083
...but you're going to have to promise,
here and now,

334
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,833
to no longer sell burial insurance
in southern Mississippi.

335
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,375
Okay.

336
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,375
So does this mean we have a deal?

337
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,708
I'll get my lawyers
to draw up the contracts

338
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,583
so we can get it done immediately.

339
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,083
What the hell is taking so long?

340
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,416
We closed on this deal, um...

341
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,833
Coming up on four months now.

342
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,875
They keep trying to re-trade the terms.

343
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,541
When we left Vancouver,
they said it would take 30 days max.

344
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,250
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I don't know, makes perfect sense to me.

345
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,375
Why?

346
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,375
Have you considered the possibility

347
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,666
that Loewen has no intention
of closing this deal at all?

348
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,958
Son, with all due respect,
you don't have the faintest idea

349
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,291
what you're talking about.

350
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,500
I think I do.

351
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,333
Think about it.

352
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,875
The longer he stalls,
the worse you're screwed.

353
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,083
First, the insurance commission
takes your license,

354
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,708
effectively destroying your livelihood,

355
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,041
until, sooner or later, you have no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.

356
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,583
Now not only does Loewen get
the three homes,

357
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,791
he can actually buy your entire business
out from under you

358
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,208
at yard-sale prices.

359
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,041
You really think
he's trying to bankrupt me?

360
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,375
Hell, he can't do that;
I got a signed contract.

361
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,083
It was only signed on our end.

362
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,791
With no closing date attached.

363
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,250
And, by the way, I heard Mr. Loewen

364
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,833
is actually still selling insurance
in the region.

365
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,916
Oh, come on.
Stop with the conspiracy theories.

366
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,083
Son, I'm sorry,
but you really are paranoid.

367
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,166
Okay.

368
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,250
Um...

369
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,083
would you mind doing me a favor?

370
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,875
Would you mind stop calling me son?

371
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,541
I am not your son, Mike.

372
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,708
Whoa.

373
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
Just take it easy, okay?

374
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,500
You really want to be taken seriously

375
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,416
- as a lawyer in this town?
- Okay. Who says I'm not?

376
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,375
Enough of that, y'all.

377
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,541
Do you really think Mr. Loewen has the
intention of running me into the ground?

378
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,000
I do.

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,791
Why the hell should he be
on our clock anyway?

380
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,416
Well, that's it. I'm gonna sue him.

381
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,541
You've never sued anybody before
in your whole life.

382
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,666
Well, I'm liable to,
just about any minute now.

383
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,958
Yeah. Well, you think 75 years of age
is a good time to start suing people?

384
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,750
Old men don't file lawsuits.

385
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,750
The way I see it, if somebody tries
to take advantage of you,

386
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,583
and you know it's wrong,
it don't matter how old you are.

387
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,541
This fellow tried to bully me
out of business.

388
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,125
And I don't think
I should be expected to stand for it.

389
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm here to file a lawsuit.

390
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,416
That the complaint right there?

391
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,583
May I see it, please?

392
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,375
<i>"Jeremiah J. O'Keefe Sr.
v. The Loewen Group LLC."</i>

393
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,083
Ooh.

394
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,583
Sounds juicy.

395
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,500
Who do you think's gonna win?

396
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,125
- Excuse me?

397
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,958
Well, goodness, Hal,

398
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,166
what are you doing here?

399
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,791
- You know what time it is?
- Look, uh,

400
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,208
I know it's late.
I'm really sorry about that.

401
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,333
I-I found something I think will be
really useful for our case.

402
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,666
ROBIN LEACH
The thrills continue with another

403
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,583
opulent episode on
<i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</i>

404
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,666
{\an8}<i>You won't believe
the amazing journey of famed</i>

405
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,791
{\an8}<i>personal injury lawyer Willie E. Gary,</i>

406
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,375
{\an8}<i>a man who refused to accept
a life sentence of poverty</i>

407
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,250
{\an8}<i>because he believed in the American dream.</i>

408
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,541
<i>Born to a family of migrant sharecroppers</i>

409
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,125
<i>working the sugarcane fields of Florida,</i>

410
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,625
<i>life wasn't always a bed of roses
for Willie Gary.</i>

411
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,625
I just always had this burning desire
to be something, you know?

412
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,666
And I-I knew I was going
to make something of myself.

413
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,291
<i>And make something of himself he did,</i>

414
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,708
<i>as now Willie regularly wins
multimillion-dollar cases...</i>

415
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,166
Are you suggesting I hire this guy
as one of my lawyers?

416
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,833
Seems like a crazy idea,

417
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,916
but this guy wins cases. I mean...

418
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,958
{\an8}<i>He not only owns
his own private 737 jet,</i>

419
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,666
{\an8}<i>called</i> Wings of Justice,

420
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,125
{\an8}<i>he also lives the high life
in a 50-room mansion</i>

421
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,291
{\an8}<i>along the luxurious Florida coast.</i>

422
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,291
<i>But Willie can't take credit
for the decorating,</i>

423
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,541
<i>as that job belongs
to Willie's childhood sweetheart,</i>

424
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,458
<i>his gorgeous and alluring wife Gloria.</i>

425
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,541
<i>One thing</i>

426
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,291
that I always try
to remind Willie of is to...

427
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
- is to never forget where he came from.
- Mm.

428
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,166
- Stay humble.
<i>Yes,</i>

429
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,000
<i>"humble" is Willie Gary's middle name.</i>

430
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,875
Don't never let nobody tell you
you can't do something, okay?

431
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,583
Willie Gary told you that.

432
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,041
Give me a pound.

433
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,666
<i>Never forgetting his roots...</i>

434
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,291
Believe it or not, he's got
an absolutely flawless trial record.

435
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,333
He supposedly hasn't lost a case
in over 12 years.

436
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,833
What does he know about contract law?

437
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,500
This is a contract law case.

438
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,583
The case was filed down in Hinds County.

439
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,416
That's a three-to-one Black/white ratio.

440
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,041
That means there's a 70% chance
we'll get a Black judge,

441
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,791
and if we do go to trial,

442
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,708
likely a Black jury as well.

443
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,125
- So what?
- With all due respect,

444
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,791
you-you can't put a guy like Mike Allred
in front of a Black jury.

445
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,875
Why the hell not?

446
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,583
He has been my attorney for 30 years.

447
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,041
He knows contract law better than anybody.

448
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
You're really gonna
make me spell this out.

449
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,083
Um...

450
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:11,791
He literally reeks self-satisfied,
good ol' boy Southern bigotry.

451
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,583
I mean, a Black jury sees
a guy like that coming...

452
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,208
The idea of us pandering to a jury
like that, Hal, it's not...

453
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,000
It...

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,083
This is not a discrimination suit.

455
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,125
You and I both know
that race has nothing to do with this.

456
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,208
I happen to know, for a fact,
that Mr. Gary is trying a case

457
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,958
down in Florida this week.

458
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,875
What if... what if...

459
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,875
you and I went down there,
just for the day,

460
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,750
and try to meet him in person?

461
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,375
Essentially, we just want
to hold the Loewen Group

462
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,000
responsible for their actions.

463
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,416
Nah, nah, nah. That ain't what you want.

464
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,041
What you want to do
is you want to make 'em pay.

465
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,541
Make 'em hurt,
make 'em pay. -Yeah, yeah.

466
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,458
So, how much money y'all trying
to get, hmm?

467
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,875
Uh, $6 million.
- $6 million.

468
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,541
That's full, fair market value
plus damages,

469
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:08,708
and I've already filed a civil claim
in Hinds County, Mississippi.

470
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,541
Well?

471
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,291
What-what do you think, Mr. Gary?
Do you like the case?

472
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,041
I'm gonna give you my personal opinion.

473
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,625
Honest.

474
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,791
Look, Mr. O'Keefe, I'm sorry for
what this Loewen guy did to you--

475
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,416
he sounds like he's a big asshole
and everything like that--

476
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,375
but, um, this ain't no Willie Gary case.

477
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,166
It just ain't. It ain't...

478
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,500
It ain't a Willie Gary case.

479
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,166
Uh, wait, what-what do you mean?
Why-why not?

480
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,166
It ain't a Willie Gary case

481
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,291
- 'cause it ain't for Willie Gary.
- No, but...

482
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm sorry,
what is a "Willie Gary case," then?

483
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,916
- I don't...
- In other words, what he's saying is

484
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,750
a Willie Gary case is the type of case
where I have the upper hand.

485
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,250
Where I feel that I can take
this case to trial. Understand?

486
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,375
- All the way.
- And-and once I get 'em in that trial,

487
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,666
I mean, y'all seen my tape.

488
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,416
When I get 'em in front of--
especially in front of people

489
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,541
that-that look like me--
I'm-a play 'em like a symphony.

490
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,000
Mm. Mozart.

491
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,041
A Willie Gary case is
where I could take that judgement

492
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,125
and push it all the way up,
to the heavens if I need to,

493
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,500
and get as much money as I can
for my client.

494
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,750
Uh, what he's saying is,
a Willie Gary case

495
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,083
is a case we know we can win.

496
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,750
This case... not so much.

497
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,458
Matter of fact,
your case a little bit iffy.

498
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,250
And, uh...

499
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,875
the other thing is this.

500
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,041
Don't take this the wrong way, but, uh...

501
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,541
He, uh, he's-- you're white-- he's white.

502
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,875
And I don't have white clients.

503
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,708
I've never had any, so...

504
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:35,541
No offense or anything like that,
but this is just unusual for me.

505
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,583
No offense taken, Mr. Gary.

506
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,041
That guy's too rich and famous
for us, Halbert.

507
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,625
Uh-huh.

508
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,041
Um, you know what, Mr. O'Keefe?
Just, um...

509
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,375
- What?
- You know, just-just give me one second.

510
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,583
- All right?
- Where you going?

511
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,916
I'm-I'm gonna talk with him one more time.

512
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,333
G-Give me five minutes, okay?

513
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,125
The green light scenario,

514
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,041
when I was talking to the,
the one juror, uh, uh...

515
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,500
What'd she have on?

516
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,458
I'd have maybe looked at her
a little bit longer.

517
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,791
You know, gave her some eye contact.

518
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,583
- Sometimes you got to romance them.
- Listen, I'm not...

519
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,416
- That's the thing, I don't know that...
- Look, Mr. Gary,

520
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,416
I'm so sorry to come back in here
like this, I really am,

521
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,250
- but I just need a minute of your time.
What's going on with you, man?

522
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,958
- You lost? Huh?
- Yeah. Lost your mind...

523
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,833
Or did he fire your ass
out there by the elevator?

524
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,583
Okay, yeah, maybe so,
but listen, I... I...

525
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,708
- I just need a minute of your time.
- You need a minute?

526
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,708
- One minute. That's all I ask.
- Well, you know what, that's all you got.

527
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,125
'Cause we busy. Then, come on, Hal.

528
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean, Jerry's a... a dream client.

529
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,791
He's got a great narrative.

530
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,083
He's a war hero.

531
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,625
A decorated war hero.

532
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,333
He served in World War II.

533
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,333
He was, he was awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross... -Yeah.

534
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,375
- ...for service for his country.
- Hmm.

535
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,458
- Is that all you got?
- Man.

536
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,625
That's it?

537
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,958
- Wasn't World War II about 50 years ago?
- Yeah, man.

538
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,333
Hal, don't nobody give a shit
except them. -That's old news, nigga.

539
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,750
All right. All right. How about this?

540
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,083
Okay, um...

541
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,333
In 1976,

542
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:52,958
Jerry was serving as a two-term mayor
in his hometown of Biloxi.

543
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,958
The KKK tried to organize a march...

544
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,791
And he stopped 'em
from buying white sheets.

545
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,458
- Shit, man.
- I guess, I guess he's supposed to be

546
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,708
- our white savior now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. KKK, man.

547
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,250
You sound like you in love with him, man.

548
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,000
No, that's not my point. I'm saying we're
hopefully trying the case in Hinds County.

549
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,208
- There's a three-to-one...
- Hold-hold on. Let me stop you, Hal.

550
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,625
Now, listen, Hal, I like you--
I-I think you come from good stock--

551
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,208
but you got to understand
how we work here.

552
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,250
One, we don't do contract law.

553
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,208
- Two, we don't have no white clients.
No.

554
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,000
And three, that ain't enough money.

555
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,833
My, not enough money.

556
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,125
It ain't enough money, Hal.
You know, I-I-I love you, man,

557
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,833
but it ain't enough money for us.

558
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,791
Brother, look around.
You see where you are?

559
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,041
You don't see this mahogany wood?

560
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,541
- Gold finish?
- Got to see it.

561
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,958
- Preach. Yeah.
It's the big time, baby.

562
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,166
We doing cases for $50 million,
$30 million,

563
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,791
- $80 million cases monthly.
- Yeah.

564
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,208
Okay. Okay.

565
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,083
But how do you know this case
can't be something bigger?

566
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,416
Well...

567
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,750
we don't know.

568
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,625
You know something we don't?

569
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,666
Ray Loewen happens to sit at the top

570
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,833
of one of the biggest industries
in this country.

571
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,000
Hmm.

572
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,458
I'm talking about the $20 billion a year
death care industry.

573
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,333
There are two huge corporations moving in
and taking over everything,

574
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,291
and the Loewen Group is one of them.

575
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,666
Now, what they did to Jerry
is truly terrible, but...

576
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,791
I have a feeling it's just... it's-it...

577
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:22,125
No. I know. It's the tip of the iceberg.

578
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,416
- Hmm.
Can I keep going?

579
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,750
Sure. Shit.

580
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,791
Well, that's where you should've started.

581
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,541
You guys try all these
$80 million cases, and...

582
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,666
and you have your private jet and
all that, I get it, that's fine, but...

583
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, I do. <i>Wings of Justice.</i>

584
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,583
Great. Look, you know as well as I do

585
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,375
that as far as the more elite
legal community in this country goes,

586
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,708
you're nothing more than
a glorified ambulance chaser.

587
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,000
No offense. -Now, Hal, now don't make me
whoop your ass now.

588
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,750
- Disrespectful, boy.
- What if...

589
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,291
What if, what-what if...

590
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,625
what if this case is the one
that puts you on the map?

591
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,375
What if this case takes you
to a nationwide level?

592
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,791
I'm talking, um...

593
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,708
William Kuntsler,

594
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,833
Clarence Darrow,

595
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,541
Thurgood Marshall.

596
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,708
Look, I'm talking...

597
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,625
I'm talking Johnnie motherfucking Cochran.

598
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,916
Well, I've never heard of him.

599
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,208
Was this your idea,
by the way, Mr. Dockins?

600
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,083
- Yes.
- No, it was not his idea,

601
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,000
it was mine, and I realize, Mike,
it might piss you off,

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,708
me bringing on additional counsel
like this, but...

603
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,458
Piss me off? Not at all.

604
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,375
Doesn't piss me-- Do I seem pissed off?

605
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,291
I'm not pissed off.

606
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,166
Hell, it's your money,
you can do what you want to with it,

607
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,291
I just think you're making a big mistake.

608
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,875
I am trying to put us
in the best possible position

609
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,666
in the event we end up going to trial.

610
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,791
Got it.

611
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,541
Except we're not going to trial.

612
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,166
Seriously, what's so special
about this guy, anyway?

613
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,958
Hal and I went over to Florida to
watch him try a case in front of a jury,

614
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,375
and I want to tell you,
this man can absolutely,

615
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,125
positively galvanize a jury.

616
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,750
Yes, sir.

617
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,041
Well...

618
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,291
if you believe in him that much,

619
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,958
then sure, okay, I'll work with him.

620
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,291
I've partnered up before.

621
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,916
Just as long as it's clear

622
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,583
I'm still lead attorney.

623
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,125
Appreciate you being a good sport
about this, Mike.

624
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,000
No problem.

625
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,875
So what time is he supposed
to get here, anyway?

626
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,833
You know, actually,
I think this is them now.

627
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,208
Now?

How you doing, Jerry?

636
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,708
- Good to see you, Willie.
- Good to see you, doc.

637
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,875
Good to see you. You looking good.

638
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,833
- Thank you.
- Hey, Hal, what you doing over there, huh?

639
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,000
- It's a pleasure.
- You gettin' younger on me, man?

640
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,666
Huh? What, you on some Dorian Gray shit?

641
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,958
Willie, let me introduce you
to Mike Allred, right here.

642
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,291
Mike.

643
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,166
Now, I understand
we working together, hmm?

644
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,625
So I understand. How you doing, Mr. Gary?

645
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,708
I look like a million, huh?

646
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,916
You look like
ten million Yankee dollars, Willie.

647
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,583
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

648
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,916
I feel good.

649
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,208
This your war room here, huh?

650
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,833
Uh, well, we got the conference room,
you know. -Mm-hmm.

651
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:18,166
I like these over there.
I like these books. I like all those.

652
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,583
This is nice, though.

653
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,958
Before we get to work, though...

654
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,333
I hope this doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable, but, uh...

655
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,958
I got some questions I got to ask you.

656
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:28,375
Oh, sure. Feel free to ask me anything.
I'm all ears.

657
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,583
Good.

658
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,375
Um, question is, uh...

659
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,541
how do you feel
about working with Black folk?

660
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,041
Man-to-man?

661
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,208
Is there any other way?

662
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,166
No, sir. You want an honest answer?

663
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,666
- I need that.
- All right.

664
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,916
Well, if you want an honest answer,

665
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,208
truth be told,
I suppose I am a little prejudiced.

666
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,333
Mm. Okay.

667
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,541
I'm not saying I'm proud of it
or anything.

668
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,958
- I appreciate your honesty.
- In fact, I've been working real hard

669
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,083
on trying to overcome it.

670
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,666
Mm. Well, then you should.

671
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,333
- I'm glad you're working on it.
- But yes.

672
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,791
Did you meet my team?

673
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,291
Hi. I'm Chris.

674
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,666
Hi, Chris.

675
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,333
Yes. Dashaan.

676
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,541
- Dashaan.
- Mm.

677
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,291
Al.

678
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,708
Reggie Douglas.

679
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,958
Gentlemen.

680
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay. Uh...
now that that's all cleared up,

681
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,541
why don't we all just head over
to the conference room,

682
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,416
where the rest of the team
is waiting, yeah?

683
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,041
Jerry. We're gonna work this out,
all right?

684
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,541
- Yeah.
- He's gonna be okay.

685
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,000
Okay, that's fine.

686
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,750
Afternoon, gentlemen. How you feeling?

687
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,750
You good? Huh? Good, good, good.

688
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,791
For all y'all that don't know who I am,
my name is Willie Gary.

689
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,291
Tell 'em who you are.

690
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,458
Now, I done brought a couple of partners
of mine from my firm up here from Florida

691
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,208
to help y'all win this case.

692
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:44,958
And for all of y'all who are unfamiliar
with the Willie Gary style of litigation,

693
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,208
let me break it down to you.

694
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,125
We 'bout to go to war.

695
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,291
'Cause that's what I think litigation is.

696
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,083
Litigation is war.

697
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,333
It's a battle, a battle to the death.

698
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,208
And I'm not talking about
no bullshit, either;

699
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,583
I'm talking about some
Jean-Claude Van Damme ass-kicking shit.

700
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,083
Now I know y'all looking at me crazy,
but that's how I like to get.

701
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,708
And if we don't get crazy
with these motherfuckers,

702
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,291
I'm telling you, this Loewen Group?

703
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,666
They're powerful.

704
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:11,791
Got a lot of money,
got a lot of influence.

705
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,041
They have everything that we don't.

706
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,708
But we not gonna let them intimidate us.

707
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,625
'Cause I'm not intimidated.

708
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,083
Now, it ain't no secret.

709
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,500
For the past 12 years,
I have not lost a case.

710
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,916
And why is that?

711
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,125
Can you tell me why?

712
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,666
'Cause I hate to lose.

713
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,875
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

714
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,250
I'd rather somebody pull a gun on me
and blow my head off

715
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,208
than to lose a case.

716
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,333
Now, that being said...

717
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,791
...there's one thing I'm-a tell you
I'm not gonna bend on.

718
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:48,125
I do not plan on settling this case.

719
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,125
- We don't do that, no.
Excuse me.

720
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,625
Anyone mind if I say something here?

721
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,541
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Mr. Gary,

722
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,666
when it comes to the matter of settling,
I'm afraid that's not at all

723
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,458
the strategy we've developed here.

724
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,750
In fact, I've already drafted
a letter to Mr. Loewen

725
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,708
offering to settle at $8 million.

726
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,583
Though, just between us here in this room,

727
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,166
we'd probably be willing to drop
to seven if need be.

728
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,458
Well, Mike, thank you for the update--

729
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,666
appreciate that--
but, unfortunately, things have changed.

730
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,666
We're not settling.

731
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,416
No matter what you said,

732
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,541
the discussion is still on the table

733
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:24,958
and will remain so until I've decided
what the best course is.

734
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,083
Huh.

735
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,958
Till you decided, huh?

736
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,750
What's going on here, Mike?

737
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,791
Hmm? Who's in charge?

738
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,875
No, seriously, who's in charge?

739
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,291
'Cause you done have Willie Gary
come down here to take over the case

740
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,375
and now here you're telling me
what you're gonna do.

741
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,458
I said we're not settling the case
and that comes from the lead attorney.

742
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,625
- Come again?
- Come again what?

743
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,208
What's the matter?
You need your ears checked or something?

744
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,541
Excuse me, sir.

745
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,791
- No, you're not.
- Mike, you raise a finger to me,

746
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,208
- you'll get your ass whupped in here.
- Boss, calm down.

747
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,750
Believe me, Mr. Gary, you are not
lead attorney. -AL: Come on, settle down.

748
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,000
- Then what am I, then?
- May I remind you

749
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,625
- you are in my town...
- Your town?

750
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,541
- ...sitting at my conference table...
- Every town I go to, Mike, is my town.

751
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,208
- ...across the table from my client.
- Evidently it ain't your town,

752
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,000
- or they wouldn't have called me.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

753
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,708
Gentlemen, could y'all
let the temperature down a little bit?

754
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,416
I didn't come here to fight you, Mike.

755
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,000
What?
- I said, I didn't come here to fight you.

756
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,291
I came here to get a job done.

757
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,875
Now, Mr. O'Keefe...

758
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:23,541
Last I checked, he wants to win this case.

759
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,750
Not toot his ass up in the air
for a funky little $8 million.

760
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,791
Like a bitch.

761
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,416
<i>Jesus Christ, Jerry. What's going on?</i>

762
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,416
I think we ought to give him a chance.

763
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,833
Did you hear that speech he just gave?

764
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,083
He has no idea what he's doing.

765
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,375
He hasn't lost a case in 12 years.

766
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,041
For personal injury cases.

767
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,833
He clearly has no idea about real law,
about contract law.

768
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,666
What about lead attorney?

769
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,958
You're not considering
giving him lead attorney.

770
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,375
Yeah.

771
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,125
I am.

772
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,583
We good?

773
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,833
Yeah.

774
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,458
Mike, you good?

775
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,500
All right, since we're all good,

776
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,708
uh, does anybody here mind, uh,
taking some dictation?

777
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,708
Cynthia, would you mind
taking dictation for Mr. Gary?

778
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,750
All right, Cynthia. I sure appreciate it.

779
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,250
All right.

780
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,833
Address to Mr. Ray Loewen,

781
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:29,083
Chairman, Loewen Group.

782
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,375
Dear Mr. Loewen,
my name is Willie E. Gary.

783
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,250
I've just been appointed lead counsel

784
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,625
in the suit brought against you
by Jeremiah O'Keefe.

785
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,583
In regards to the prior settlement,

786
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:46,083
the offer you received of $8 million,

787
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:49,250
I hereby rescind that offer.

788
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,208
As of the date of this new letter we have,

789
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:57,791
the new offer is
in the amount of $100 million.

790
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,875
- Whoo. That's what I'm talking about.

791
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,583
Did he just say $100 million?

792
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,416
- As in eight zeros?
- $100 million.

793
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,416
Why don't y'all just relax?
Hear what I'm saying?

794
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:08,166
It's literally $94 million more
than our original claim.

795
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,125
Sounds to me like your original claim
was about $94 million short.

796
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,458
Uh, yeah, Mr. Gary, perhaps you could

797
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,958
- help us understand...
$100 million?

798
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,291
It's absurd and you know it.

799
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,250
What you trying to do, destroy this case?

800
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,541
Mike, anybody ever tell you
you got balls the size of a garden slug?

801
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,666
W-Willie, I'm afraid that I agree
with everybody's concerns.

802
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,708
That's a hell of a lot of money.

803
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,208
We throw out a number like that,
we're gonna humiliate ourselves.

804
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,916
Listen, I understand how you feel, Jerry.

805
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,583
But you got to trust me, okay?

806
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,625
- Mm-hmm. Trust him.
- Okay?

807
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,333
Everybody's got to trust me.

808
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,000
- All right?
Amen.

809
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,875
Now, Cynthia, where were we?

810
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,458
{\an8}
<i>"Starting as of the date of this letter,</i>

811
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,666
{\an8}<i>"our new settlement demand is now</i>

812
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,000
$100 million."

813
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,416
-  -
Oh, what?

814
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,291
Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me.

815
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:51,666
- $100 million?
Who the hell does he think he is?

816
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:52,750
Is he crazy?
Eight zeros, did you count that?

817
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,291
- Eight zeros.
- There's no way that is not a joke.

818
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,833
- That is a joke.
- It looks like a fucking dozen eggs.

819
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,708
No joke.

820
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,291
Jesus Christ, this O'Keefe guy,
he's a piece of work, no?

821
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,125
Yeah.

822
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,125
Who is this clown he's hired as a lawyer?

823
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:11,208
Apparently, some guy
by the name of William Gary.

824
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:14,125
Thank you, Bob, I also read the letter.

825
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,291
But my question is,

826
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,708
who is he?

827
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,041
What's his story?

828
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,750
Where did O'Keefe find him?

829
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,250
From what we could dig up,

830
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,416
he's this kind of flashy
personal injury lawyer,

831
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,125
uh, out of Florida.

832
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,666
- Ambulance-chaser type.
- Personal injury?

833
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,291
This is a contract dispute.

834
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,291
Why the hell would he hire
a personal injury lawyer

835
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,291
for a contract dispute?

836
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,333
Maybe they don't have any regular lawyers

837
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,291
down in backwater Mississippi.

838
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,375
You should talk like that more.

839
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,666
Turns out, the case was filed
in some remote county

840
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,166
in the lower region of the state,
called Hinds County.

841
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,791
Yeah? So?

842
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,833
So, Hinds County also happens to be

843
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:55,458
one of the poorest, and about 70%, uh...

844
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,125
...Black.

845
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,125
Oh.

846
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,666
So that's why he was hired.

847
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,375
Because he's Black.

848
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,666
Gary's Black.

849
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,250
He's an African American man.

855
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,833
Well, like I said,
like my grandfather said,

856
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,791
-"Who in so ever it is..."

857
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,916
I ain't worried about it.

858
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:40,500
Reg, you're not understanding the whole...

859
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,833
Sorry to interrupt.

860
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,625
We just got the info you requested

861
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,291
on who Loewen appointed as lead counsel.

862
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,416
May I see that, please? Thank you.
- Well, who is he?

863
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,708
Do we know him?

864
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,541
- She.
She?

865
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:55,083
What you talking about, "she"?

866
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,958
Yeah, what does that mean, "she"?

867
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,666
-"She" as in, like, a... like a...
- A woman?

868
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,541
Her name is Mame Downes.

869
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,458
♪ Ooh... ♪

870
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,875
She graduated with her BA
from Howard University.

871
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,666
Oh. That means she just ain't a woman,

872
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,916
- she's a Black woman.
- She's a sister.

873
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,416
Well, what do you know?

874
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:17,000
We done got out-Blacked
and out-womaned, all in one go.

875
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,791
Graduated top of her class
from Harvard Law School.

876
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,500
Jesus Christ.

877
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,833
Then went on to clerk two years

878
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,750
for Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.

879
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,958
Three years associate at Paul, Weiss

880
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,375
and now currently
the youngest partner ever

881
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,250
at Cranston, Brown and Atwell.

882
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,708
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, that's impressive.

883
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,416
Friend of mine used to work with her,
over at C, B and A.

884
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,875
And, um...

885
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,833
well...

886
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,916
he told me they had a nickname for her
around the office.

887
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,125
Mm. What was it?

888
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,458
Ain't that right?

889
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,041
"The Python."

890
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,958
On account of her
particular style during cross?

891
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:08,750
- Yes. Yes.
- You know, how she used to strike

892
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,583
- when you least expect it.

893
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,375
Mm-hmm. Okay, Ms. Python.

894
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,041
- But you know what?
Very descriptive.

895
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,750
You know what?

896
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,333
I'm the boa constrictor.

897
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,708
Let's see what she got.

898
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,875
<i>I think we may need
to call the cable company.</i>

899
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,000
Every time I try
and turn on Turner Broadcast,

900
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,833
it's just some weird, empty screen.

901
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,875
Think there's something wrong with it.

902
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,291
There's nothing wrong with it.
I canceled the subscription.

903
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:35,166
What do you mean, you canceled it?

904
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:38,625
Annie, those insurance regulators
came by again the other day.

905
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,541
They suspended my license this time.

906
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:44,875
I'm gonna have to shut the business
down for a while.

907
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,250
What?

908
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,750
What are you talking about?

909
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,750
It's only temporary.

910
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,458
Soon as we get this trial over with,
Loewen makes his restitution,

911
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,333
- we gonna be up and...
- Jerry. Jerry.

912
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,916
You hear yourself?

913
00:38:56,916 --> 00:39:00,083
As soon as Ray Loewen makes restitution?

914
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,916
Do you really know for sure
that's even gonna happen?

915
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,583
I mean, you still haven't told me
how we're paying for all this.

916
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:17,000
That fancy new lawyer
you just brought in from Florida.

917
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,666
You don't have to worry about him.

918
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:27,125
Well, I just don't understand why you're
continuing with this ridiculous lawsuit.

919
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,208
You can find another buyer

920
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,958
for those three homes.

921
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,500
You know that.

922
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,583
Clearly, this is about
something else for you.

923
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,916
Maybe it is.

924
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,166
Maybe I just don't want
to see him get away with it.

925
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,708
Who? Ray Loewen?

926
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,208
My God, Jerry.

927
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:49,250
What is your obsession with this man?

928
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,500
What do you expect me to do, Annie,

929
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,041
just lay back
and let him walk all over me?

930
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,500
Let him walk all over our family?

931
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,833
What I expect you to do

932
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,333
is to think of me,

933
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,916
at some point.

934
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,333
Hmm.

935
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:09,375
You don't think we can win.

936
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,958
If you want to know how I'm paying for it,

937
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,958
I took out a third mortgage on this house.

938
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,083
How you doing?

939
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,458
Tell me, Willie,
how'd you wind up being a lawyer?

940
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,250
Mm.

941
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,041
Well, that depends.

942
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:43,541
You want the, um, long or the short story?

943
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,000
That's up to you.

944
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,708
- Well,

945
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,291
when I was a young husband,

946
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,708
young father,

947
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,500
me and my wife, we had,
you know, we had a little money,

948
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,666
so we had a little landscaping business.

949
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,541
Real nice, too.

950
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,166
You know, kept-kept all the yards...

951
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,916
fantastic.

952
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,833
But then my wife was like,
"You know what?

953
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,250
I want to move into a bigger place."

954
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,916
I said, "Well, all right.
Let's do that, then."

955
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,833
And so...

956
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,958
...got the paper, saw this ad.

957
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:14,625
Three-bedroom apartment, man.
Real nice.

958
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,916
Uh, nice new complex.

959
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:20,250
Over there in a white neighborhood
at, uh, Raintree.

960
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,375
So I said, "Yeah, that's what,
that's what we need."

961
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,125
So I called the owner, I said, "Hey, man.

962
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,583
"Me and my family are looking
for a new place.

963
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,291
We want to come to where you are."

964
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,375
I said, "Do you have any vacancies?"

965
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,166
And he says, "Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got plenty of vacancies, you know?

966
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,208
"Matter of fact, uh, at the end
of the month, you can move in.

967
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,375
Get your lease."

968
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,208
We all looking forward to that day, man.

969
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,541
I mean, we just excited.

970
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,625
You know, just brand-new beginnings,
if you would.

971
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,250
So when the day comes,

972
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,666
I pack everybody in the car.

973
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,125
I got the-the-the, the boys in there,

974
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,875
I got my-my wife,
I even got my dog in there, man.

975
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,375
And we just happy, man. We happy.

976
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,583
Uh, and we listening to gospel music.

977
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,541
You know, singing, rocking and rolling.

978
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,916
But, um...

979
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:05,083
when we get there, guy comes out.

980
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,083
I said, "How you doing?" He barely speaks.

981
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,583
He says, "What do you need?"

982
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,208
I said, "I'm the one that, uh,
called you about the vacancies."

983
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,000
He said, "What vacancies?"

984
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,041
I said, "I'm Willie Gary.
I called you about the... the vacancies."

985
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,833
He says, "Oh.

986
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,750
We don't have no more vacancies."

987
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,666
What'd you do?

988
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,458
Tell you what I wanted to do.

989
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,500
Wanted to hurt him.

990
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,041
I mean...

991
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,791
disrespecting me like that
in front of my boys, man.

992
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,875
My boys look up to me.

993
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,291
I'm their everything.

994
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,708
What-what do I tell 'em?

995
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,166
That...

996
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,666
they daddy ain't good enough
to be in an apartment?

997
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,875
What I tell my queen?

998
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:51,500
That we not good enough?

999
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,500
But I didn't act out.

1000
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,541
What I did was,

1001
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,375
I went back to that hotel,

1002
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,583
and I opened up the phone book.

1003
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,875
Now, I hadn't even thought about
being a lawyer until this happened.

1004
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,458
I opened it up and I...

1005
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,166
First law school I saw,
I said, "Mm. I'm going right there."

1006
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,458
And I did it.

1007
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,250
I enrolled, worked hard,

1008
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,833
I graduated, I passed the bar.

1009
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,125
And I got my own practice.

1010
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,333
And the first thing I did was

1011
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,833
went down to Raintree Apartments

1012
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:32,916
and bitch-slapped him with a five-count
discriminatory practices lawsuit.

1013
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,125
Take that for your vacancies.

1014
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,333
You a fighter.

1015
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,041
Yeah.

1016
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,583
Oh, I'm a fighter.

1017
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,750
You are, too, Jerry.
You're a fighter, man.

1018
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,416
You know why I say you're a fighter?

1019
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:52,333
Going up against
this big Loewen Group, man--

1020
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,708
small business owner, man,
that's something, doc.

1021
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,500
That's why we connect.

1022
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,416
What made you want to do it?

1023
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,041
'Cause he tried to mess with the one thing
that means the most to me in life:

1024
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,750
being able to leave something behind
for my children

1025
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,166
and my grandchildren when I go.

1026
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,458
They have a legacy, Willie.

1027
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,125
And I do mean to pass it on to 'em.

1028
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,958
- Let's play some music.
- I like music, Willie.

1029
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,333
Good.

1030
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,500
Steve, look, why don't you go up there
and turn on some music?

1031
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,125
Sure thing, boss.
Anything particular you want to hear?

1032
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,416
You know what my jam is, man.
Tony! Toni! Toné!

1033
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,416
- Wise choice, my brother.
- I like that. Like that.

1034
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,958
You know what's crazy about
Tony! Toni! Toné!?

1035

Hi.

1053
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,416
Welcome to Hotel Intercontinental.

1054
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:15,291
Well, thank you. I have a reservation
for Gary, Willie Gary.

1055
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:16,875
Absolutely.

1056
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,583
- And welcome to Jackson, Mr. Gary.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1057
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,375
If you have a credit card
you'd like me to run,

1058
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,250
I can go ahead and get you all settled in.

1059
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,583
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1060
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,375
Hey, hey, so don't look now, but that's,
over there, that's Loewen's legal team.

1061
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,625
Where-where's that? Hmm.

1062
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,833
Jesus Christ.

1063
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,875
It's like a who's who of every prominent
Black lawyer in the country.

1064
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,583
You actually recognize all of them?

1065
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,250
Okay, so, that guy over there,
that's Howard Pfieffer.

1066
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,500
- Mm.
- He's a former state representative

1067
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,208
and current president
of the DC bar association. -Mm.

1068
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,541
That gentleman there,
that's Richard Mayfield.

1069
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,708
He's one of the leading experts
on antitrust

1070
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,833
and complex business litigation.

1071
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,833
And that gentleman, right over there,
that-that's Walter Bell.

1072
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,125
He's a former
Supreme Court Justice of Mississippi.

1073
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,500
Fuck.

1074
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,666
Man, Loewen must have spent
a fortune on these dudes.

1075
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:04,083
You know what? She don't actually look
as bad as I thought she was gonna look.

1076
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,625
What's her name?
Uh, uh, Mammy, May, Mame?

1077
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,916
Mammy, Mammy Downes?

1078
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,875
- Seriously? Is that all you have to say?
- Yeah.

1079
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,500
That's all I got to say
'cause they all look like chumps to me.

1080
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,083
Matter of fact, could you do me a favor?

1081
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:18,750
Could you send your finest bottle of, uh,
champagne over there to that table?

1082
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,541
Certainly. Do you have a preference?

1083
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,875
- What you got?
- We have Dom, Moët,

1084
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,125
- Cristal...
- Cristal.

1085
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,250
- Cristal.
- That's what we need.

1086
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,375
Send some Cristal over there.

1087
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:29,291
Make sure that you say that it's, uh,
compliments of Mr. Willie Gary.

1088
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,041
Hey. Seriously, man?

1089
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,083
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, seriously, Hal.

1090
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,583
- Shut up.
- Uh...

1091
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,666
Listen, I always say this:

1092
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,875
You see me fighting a bear?
Pour honey on me.

1093
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,666
We're just gonna pour a little honey.

1094
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,166
<i>Well, we keep the strategy simple.</i>

1095
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,458
<i>Firmly cementing
the validity of the document</i>

1096
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,625
as a contract in the jury's mind.

1097
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,833
That's definitely gonna be
the defense strategy, too.

1098
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,333
Except they'll be focused on proving
how it's not a contract.

1099
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,833
Okay, look,
we got to be honest about this.

1100
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,041
They're likely gonna be
a lot better at this than we are,

1101
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,583
considering this is
their area of expertise.

1102
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:05,250
I-I say we just forget
about all that contract mumbo jumbo.

1103
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,875
Bog the jury down
with a whole bunch of information

1104
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,000
that we know they ain't interested in.

1105
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,041
Personally, what I think we gotta do--

1106
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,791
what we gotta prove, rather--

1107
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,208
is motive.

1108
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,250
We center our argument
squarely on the issue

1109
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,750
of Loewen Group stalling on closing.

1110
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,375
And show what they had to gain from it.

1111
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:23,000
- Uh, I'm not so sure.
- What? What, Hal?

1112
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,500
- What-what you ain't sure about?
What? Hal?

1113
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,208
What I mean is,
I'm not so sure we can actually prove

1114
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:28,416
that the Loewen Group had motive.

1115
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,666
Right? Unless we have
some kind of internal company memo.

1116
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:33,041
Or someone just openly admits it.

1117
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,000
Like, how do you actually prove

1118
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,833
that the stalling was intentional?

1119
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,958
Well, we're obviously never
going to be able to prove that.

1120
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:45,791

Although, I do believe that the

1191
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,583
Black American dream is quite different
than the white American dream.

1192
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,750
Case in point.

1193
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,125
O.J. trial, hmm?

1194
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,541
Supposed to be the "trial of the century."

1195
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:53,041
- It's a circus.

1196
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:54,208
You want to go there?

1197
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:56,125
Nah, that's murky territory.

1198
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,625
Where you leaning?

1199
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,375
Is... is he innocent? Or is he guilty?

1200
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,291
Doesn't matter.

1201
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,958
'Cause O.J.'s not the one
that's on trial right now.

1202
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:07,125
White frontier justice,

1203
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,000
- that's what's on trial.
- Mm.

1204
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,250
I hear that.

1205
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,958
Gun to your head, though.

1206
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,375
- Gun to my head?
- Gun to your head.

1207
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,625
- I don't know now.
- Gun to your head,

1208
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,625
- Ms. Downes, gun to your head.
- Come on, trying to put a gun to my head.

1209
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,000
- Does anyone hear this?
- Got a gun... gun to your head now.

1210
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,750
Oh, hell nah.

1211
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,666
Opportunity to be the lead counsel
on the defense

1212
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,125
or a opportunity to be
the lead prosecutor,

1213
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,166
which one do you choose?

1214
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:29,166
Oh, that's... that's a tricky one.

1215
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,083
- Yeah, I know. It's tough, it's tough.
- Defense.

1216
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,125
His ass is guilty.

1217
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,416
And I've never defended someone
who I knew was guilty before.

1218
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,416
You know what they say:

1219
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:41,500
Lawyer's got to try that at least once.

1220
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,041
Remember these words:

1221
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,916
- if it doesn't fit...
Hmm.

1222
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,541
...you must acquit.

1223
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,958
Prosecution.

1224
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,250
Yeah?

1225
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,375
I have this reoccurring dream

1226
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,708
that I'm prosecuting a case

1227
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:59,125
against that slick-ass Johnnie Cochran.

1228
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,291
-  Mm.
- Him in all them fancy suits and shit...

1229
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,583
Okay. Well, how does this dream end?

1230
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,625
I wipe the floor with him.

1231
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,791
- I wipe the floor with his ass.

1232
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,166
Oh.

1233
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,625
Let me get that.

1234
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,916
Oh, absolutely not.

1235
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,541
You were so, uh,

1236
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,541
you were so kind and generous to send me

1237
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,833
a bottle of...

1238
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,291
- What was that called?
- Cristal.

1239
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,000
Allow me to return the favor,
just this once.

1240
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,666
Although, I wouldn't get too used

1241
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:34,250
to me being kind to you, Mr. Gary.

1242
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,208
Once we begin that... trial...

1243
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,083

circuit county judge
for the First Judicial District

1280
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,791
of Hinds County, Mississippi, presiding.

Thank you for being here.

1284
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,250
This case here is really about

<i>Contracts.</i>

1286
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,000
Plain and simple.

1287
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,500
Now, Mr. Gary would have you believe

1288
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,333
that this case is about...

1289
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,625
- Greed.
<i>- And while that sounds,</i>

1290
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:01,708
uh, entertaining and a bit dramatic...

1291
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,916
We know for a fact
that the deal had already been approved

1292
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,375
by Loewen and his board.

1293
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,541
They crafted every single aspect,
outlined it,

1294
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:10,083
and put it down in writing.

1295
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,375
That's a contract.

1296
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,583
How can it be a binding contract

1297
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,916
between two parties

1298
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,333
if one of the parties
didn't sign the contract?

1299
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,416
Y'all, these people lie.

1300
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,500
That's what it boils down to.

1301
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,416
So why did Mr. O'Keefe
have such a-a-a panic,

1302
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:29,583
such an urgency,

1303
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,416
such a desperation

1304
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:33,375
for this deal to close?

1305
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,958
Why?

1306
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,250
Well, because everything in his life

1307
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,916
hinged on this deal.

1308
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,458
Everything.

1309
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,250
For the Loewen Group, not so much.

1310
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,833
They had one goal in mind.

1311
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,625
Stall him out.

1312
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,250
Stall him out.

1313
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,875
It wasn't personal.

1314
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,625
He just got impatient.

1315
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:10,833
<i>In fact, there is such a thing</i>

1316
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:14,583
uh, as an anticipatory breach of contract.

1317
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,333
And this is when,

1318
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:20,041
though the actual breach
has not yet occurred,

1319
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,333
one of the involved parties,

1320
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:27,250
heretofore referred to
as the "soon to be breaching party,"

1321
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,500
will not fulfill their obligations

1322
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,958
set forth by the terms of the agreement.

1323
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:37,041
When a situation like this arises,

1324
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:40,458
- it is my opinion that...

1325
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:45,041
...it is well within the means of dispute

1326
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,875
for this contract.

1327
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:47,958
- Wake your ass up!
- Whoa!

1328
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,041
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.

1329
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,333
Wake up!

1330
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,875
What are we doing?
We sit up in these books,

1331
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,958
talking about contracts every single day.

1332
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:55,291
For what?

1333
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,833
We putting 'em to sleep.

1334
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,458
We done lost our connection,
lost our edge.

1335
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,625
And what do I get from y'all? Nothing.

1336
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,750
I gotta make the decision.

1337
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,750
I'm-a put Jerry on.

1338
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,500
- No, no, no.
- You can't do that.

1339
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,125
We put him on next week.

1340
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,875
You hard of hearing?
I'm putting him on.

1341
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:17,916
We got to shake it up.
And plus, he's a great witness.

1342
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:21,125
You said it yourself. He's a good witness,
he's honest, he's-he's-he's,

1343
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,708
he's a family man,

1344
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,208
he's-he's a war hero.

1345
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,625
To civil-civil rights.

1346
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,166
Everything he did for Black folk?

1347
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,583
We put him in front of that jury,
he gonna play 'em.

1348
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,625
It is much too soon
to put Jerry on the stand.

1349
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,916
It's much too early in the trial.
We don't have all the information yet.

1350
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,375
It ain't never too soon with me, Mike.

1351
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,875
- It's never too soon with me.
Willie.

1352
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,083
We know nothing about Mame yet.

1353
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,791
We've only seen her interview,
what, technical witnesses?

1354
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:42,125
We know nothing
about her real cross-examination style.

1355
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,333
Nor know how actually dangerous she is.

1356
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,458
Y'all don't know y'all ass
from a hole in the ground.

1357
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:49,000
Now I made the decision.

1358
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,583
You can either get on board
or you can get the fuck out.

1359
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,416
<i>Let's talk about some of your values.</i>

1360
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,875
<i>Because, if I'm not mistaken, Jerry,
you an eight-time decorated hero.</i>

1361
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,916
<i>You got the Air Medal, the Navy Medal.</i>

1362
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:05,208
<i>You got the, you got the Flying Cross.</i>

1363
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:08,875
<i>And you did all of that
in the sacrifice for your country.</i>

1364
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,625
Well, I don't think war's anything
to be celebrated.

1365
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,875
But I did serve my country
and quite proudly.

1366
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,625
Hmm. Thank you for your service.

1367
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,333
But you didn't stop there.
You came back to your county,

1368
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,583
you took over the family business,

1369
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,625
and then, uh, you did what I call

1370
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,541
you jumped out of the frying pan
and into the fire, man.

1371
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:27,625
You wanted to be in politics, didn't you?

1372
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,583
You ran for mayor
in your home town in Biloxi.

1373
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,625
I ran twice and served two terms as mayor,

1374
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:35,625
from 1974 until 1982.

1375
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,458
And I understand, in one of those terms,

1376
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:41,000
that a very friendly group of people
came to visit you.

1377
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:43,458
The Ku Klux Klan.

1378
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,041
Objection, Your Honor.

1379
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:47,375
What is the relevance
to this line of questioning?

1380
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,958
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
We are in a case about contracts,

1381
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,500
Your Honor.

1382
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,583
You may answer that question.

1383
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,416
I denied them a permit
to demonstrate in Biloxi.

1384
00:58:57,416 --> 00:59:01,583
You told the Ku Klux Klan

1385
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,625
in Biloxi, Mississippi, "No."

1386
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,333
Now, flying warplanes is one thing,

1387
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,500
but to tell the Klan "no" at that time,
that's a different type of bravery.

1388
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,333
Jerry, I've gotten
an opportunity to know you.

1389
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,000
You and your family.

1390
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,916
But these good folks here have not.

1391
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:23,250
I just want to ask you,
what are your values?

1392
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,416
What is important to you?

1393
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:28,916
Mr. O'Keefe.

1394
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:31,833
Good day. How are you?

1395
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,666
I'm doing well, thank you.

1396
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:35,666
You are? Good.

1397
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,166
Uh...

1398
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:54,916
having just listened to the testimony
you gave,

1399
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:58,458
I think it's fair to say
that the real, material substance

1400
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,291
centered on character.
Would you agree?

1401
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:03,375
Yes. I-I agree.

1402
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,875
I couldn't hear that. Can you speak up?

1403
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,000
I said yes, ma'am, I agree.

1404
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,625
Okay, character.

1405
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,125
Let's talk about character.

1406
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,666
The overall insinuation
being made is that,

1407
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,958
while you are a man of honor,

1408
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,666
of strong moral principles,

1409
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:24,000
according to you, my client is not.

1410
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:28,666
I think Mr. Loewen and I have
very different approaches to--

1411
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,791
as to how to deal with people in business.

1412
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:33,000
Ah. "In business."

1413
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,375
Yes. Right, okay.

1414
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:37,791
Something I'm curious about...

1415
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:42,500
How did you end up needing to sell
those funeral homes to Mr. Loewen?

1416
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,250
Well, I had run into a little bit
of financial trouble.

1417
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,583
What kind of financial trouble?

1418
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,416
Huh?

1419
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:55,250
Because I'm, uh, pretty sure

1420
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,750
the actual reason you so desperately
needed to sell at the time that you did

1421
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,875
is because the Mississippi
state insurance commission

1422
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,791
was about to revoke your license.

1423
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,000
Is that correct?

1424
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,208
As a matter of fact, your license

1425
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:11,250
to sell insurance
in the state of Mississippi

1426
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,750
is currently under suspension.

1427
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,458
Can we agree that
that is a true statement,

1428
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,125
- Mr. O'Keefe?
No, we cannot.

1429
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,916
Because it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1430
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,750
Enlighten me.
How is it more complicated?

1431
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,708
Was your license suspended

1432
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,250
- or was it not?
- Objection, Your Honor,

1433
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,208
- on the simple fact that she's just angry.
- Overruled.

1434
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,958
It's a yes or no question.
- We already knew

1435
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,583
- that he was in financial trouble.
He said "overruled."

1436
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:32,875
Overruled.

1437
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,041
Well, the real truth here is that

1438
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:37,833
you lost your license

1439
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:42,458
because you got involved in some
shady savings and loans business deal

1440
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,541
with a man that, if I'm-I'm not mistaken,

1441
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:48,583
is currently in jail right now.

1442
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,041
Your Honor, objection.
Can I ask you something?

1443
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:51,208
This is not on trial here today.

1444
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,500
Overruled.
Was the money that you used

1445
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,875
to finance this deal,
was that money yours?

1446
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,750
I was responsible for that money.

1447
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,583
You used other people's money.

1448
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:01,458
Actually, you used your clients' money

1449
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:05,333
to finance your involvement
in said "business deal"

1450
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,791
with a now-convicted felon.

1451
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,000
- Am I correct?
Objection, Your Honor.

1452
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,458
Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?

1453
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,750
This has nothing to do
with this case. -Overruled.

1454
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,083
- Am I correct, Mr. O'Keefe?
- That's not how I would characterize

1455
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,291
- this at all.
I mean, is it possible

1456
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,875
that this entire case

1457
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:18,208
stems from jealousy?

1458
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,833
Objection, Your Honor.
We're talking about emotions?

1459
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:20,916
- Jealousy?
I mean,

1460
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,291
- Mr. O'Keefe...
Overruled.

1461
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:24,666
...you said yourself that
you and Mr. Loewen have

1462
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,125
very different ways of doing business,

1463
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,666
and that might be the truest statement
you've said all day long,

1464
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:30,375
because, like you,

1465
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,541
Mr. Loewen inherited a business
from his father.

1466
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,708
However, unlike you, he was able to build

1467
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:38,916
that business into
a multimillion-dollar empire.

1468
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:42,333
Meanwhile, what has become
of your father's legacy?

1469
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,583
Jerry! Hold up, now!

1470
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,125
Jerry! Wait up, will you?

1471
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,333
Jerry.

1472
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,000
What in the hell was that?

1473
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,291
What you talking about?

1474
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,708
I-I don't understand. You angry with me?

1475
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:06,958
Am I angry with you?

1476
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,250
You were supposed to protect me up there.

1477
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,958
Supposed to make sure I was safe

1478
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,458
under cross-examination and all that shit.

1479
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,833
That ain't my fault. I didn't know
she was gonna ask you all that.

1480
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,208
It's your job to know
what she's gonna ask me.

1481
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,375
You didn't tell me all this shit.

1482
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,916
You told me about the-the savings
and loan, you told me about the money,

1483
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,583
but you didn't tell me nothing
about him going to jail.

1484
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:21,916
When I made the deal with him,

1485
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,500
he was not a felon.

1486
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,708
I had every reason to believe that

1487
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:25,791
- that was a good, solid deal.
- I understand.

1488
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:28,166
But I can't read your mind.
That's not my fault.

1489
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:31,083
Of course it is.
Since the first day I hired you,

1490
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,750
you have been trying to turn this case

1491
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,958
into your own, personal one-ring circus.

1492
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,166
I've done everything I can
to try to save your ass.

1493
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,125
I put every dime I have into this deal,

1494
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,666
- and you're still fucking around.
- I understand. I'm not fucking around.

1495
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:41,916
Listen, that ain't fair.
That's not fair, Jerry.

1496
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,250
You don't have anything
on the line here, Willie.

1497
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,416
When this case is over, win, lose or draw,

1498
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,583
you're gonna get in your airplane
and fly away.

1499
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:49,583
I'm gonna be here.
I got plenty on the line.

1500
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:50,791
I got my damn life on the line,

1501
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,208
and I don't know how much of that's left.

1502
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,708
I know that, Jerry.

1503
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,375
I'm making a decision.

1504
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,750
A decision for what, Jerry?

1505
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,333
I'm gonna replace you as lead attorney.

1506
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,000
For Mike?

1507
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,833
That's what you're doing? Huh?

1508
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,291
I'm telling you right now, Jerry,

1509
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:13,333
that's a huge mistake!

1510
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,458
Shit.

1511
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,041
Hey.

1512
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,541
Hey, baby.

1513
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,875
What you doing?

1514
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,500
Just doing a little bit of reading.

1515
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,333
You-you sound a little down, baby.

1516
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,166
Is everything okay?

1517
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,541
No, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm good.
I'm good. Uh...

1518
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,916
- Okay.
- No, no.

1519
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:55,791
- Well...
- No, I, uh...

1520
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,083
- I got replaced.
- What?

1521
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,333
I said, I got replaced.

1522
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,375
- They replaced me.
- No.

1523
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,791
What?

1524
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,666
- Yeah, Jerry...
- Replaced you?

1525
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:11,500
Baby, what does that mean?

1526
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,583
It means that, uh, they want...

1527
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:17,583
they want somebody else
to be lead counsel and so, uh...

1528
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,875
...so they replaced me.

1529
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,125
- Uh...
- Honey, really?

1530
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,583
But wait. I don't understand.

1531
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,625
Why would he do that?

1532
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,833
Why?

1533
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,291
I, uh...

1534
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,833
I screwed up. Screwed up.

1535
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,333
I screwed up.

1536
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,291
I screwed up by, uh...

1537
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:45,000
I put Jerry on the stand
and I-I didn't have him prepared enough,

1538
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,541
and when they, uh,
did the cross-examination, they, uh...

1539
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,625
...they annihilated him.

1540
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:53,375
They, uh... It was bad.

1541
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,791
It's got me upset. I'm upset.

1542
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:00,958
The-the reason that I'm upset
is because I...

1543
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,583
Seeing... seeing Jerry so upset,

1544
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,166
it-it's got me upset, so I'm just...

1545
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:09,250
- I see.
- I'm upset about it.

1546
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,041
You sound like you really care
about this man.

1547
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,708
Jerry?

1548
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1549
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,041
Yeah, I care. Jerry's a cool guy.

1550
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,208
Hi. Pardon me.

1551
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:03,250
Are you, by any chance,
Mrs. Lorraine McGrath?

1552
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,041
Well...

1553
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:06,500
well, yes, but I...

1554
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,333
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I...

1555
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,166
It's just I was kind of expecting
a lawyer.

1556
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,208
Yeah, I am a lawyer.

1557
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:18,375
I'm the guy you spoke with on the phone,
Hal Dockins?

1558
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,500
Oh.

1559
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,458
I'm so sorry. Uh...

1560
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:23,125
I hope I didn't offend you.

1561
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:26,375
It just... uh, well, to be honest,
you look very young.

1562
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:30,833
Here y'all go.
Thank you.

1563
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:39,125
I worked at a Loewen-owned funeral home
for 13 years.

1564
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,125
Just... in all that time,

1565
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:47,708
I saw a lot, you know,

1566
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:52,083
about how that company operates.

1567
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,541
Before we go any further,

1568
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:55,208
I just have to ask you:

1569
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,750
would you be willing to testify?

1570
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,875
Mrs. McGrath, hi.

1571
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,291
How you doing this afternoon?

1572
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:12,833
Um, very well, thank you.

1573
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,583
That's fine. That's just fine.

1574
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,750
Mrs. McGrath, would you mind telling us

1575
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,458
how long you worked as an employee

1576
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,583
for the Durbin and Sons Funeral Home
in Southaven, Mississippi?

1577
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:24,625
Um, I worked at that funeral home

1578
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:27,000
for about 13 years before I quit.

1579
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,416
Mm-hmm.

1580
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:32,500
And did you witness any transfer
of ownership during this time period?

1581
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,875
Um...

1582
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:39,375
Uh, uh, Durbin and Sons was bought
by the Loewen Group

1583
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:42,083
sometime around 1990.

1584
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,250
And I was there during that time.

1585
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,791
And did you notice any changes

1586
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,708
in the way the company was run

1587
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,458
after the Loewen Group took over?

1588
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:55,083
Uh, the most significant was, uh,

1589
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,708
how they implemented this,

1590
01:08:56,708 --> 01:09:00,958
this policy of-of raising prices
on certain items

1591
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:04,583
in areas where they, uh,
didn't have any, any competition.

1592
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,041
Mostly, this turned out to be, um,

1593
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:14,166
poor areas,
where there was a lot of-of poverty.

1594
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:18,041
Could you give us an example
of this type of selective pricing?

1595
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:23,375
There was this one, uh,
casket in particular I remember.

1596
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,416
The, um, the Wilbert Copper Trubune.

1597
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:31,875
It, uh, was supposed to retail for $750.

1598
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:35,125
Uh, which it did in-in some places,

1599
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,041
like, say, Madison.

1600
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,791
Uh, but then in other places,
like Corinth,

1601
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:43,541
which, as you know, is-is very poor...

1602
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:44,833
Yes, of course.

1603
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:48,416
Over there, they hiked the price up
to something crazy.

1604
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:51,541
Like three times
what it was supposed to cost.

1605
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:53,750
Just because they could.

1606
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,500
They knew customers didn't have
anywhere else to go.

1607
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,500
So, basically,

1608
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,500
if I understand you,

1609
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,125
the Loewen Group was involved in
a form of selective price gouging.

1610
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,583
Of what?

1611
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,541
Objection. Your Honor,
how could the witness possibly know

1612
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,833
the intentions of people
she's never even met before?

1613
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:15,291
Sustained.

1614
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,625
All right, then.

1615
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,291
Let me ask you this.

1616
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:21,500
In your time at Durbin and Sons,
were you ever left

1617
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,041
with the impression that the Loewen Group

1618
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,750
might have been specifically targeting

1619
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,166
- minority communities...
Objection.

1620
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,791
- Your Honor.
- Wow! Really?

1621
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,958
- My God.
Speculation.

1622
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:35,500
Mr. Allred, what is the basis
for this line of questioning?

1623
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,541
Mr. Allred?

1624
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:39,541
You know what?

1625
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:41,041
I apologize.

1626
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:44,750
No basis. It was just speculation, is all.

1627
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,416
Please, consider it stricken.

1628
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,833
But Your Honor, I do take exception
to Ms. Downes' tone.

1629
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,000
- You've got to be kidding.
- My tone?

1630
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,916
Noted.
- Her tone.

1631
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:57,541
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Mrs. McGrath.

1632
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,125
No further questions.

1633
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,416
It was noted, all right.

1634
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,750
Morning, Jerry.

1635
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,708
Willie, how are you?

1636
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,208
I guess you're still mad at me, huh?

1637
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:28,291
It was a very bad day.
Why don't we just leave it at that?

1638
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,833
All right, here we go.

1639
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,625
Look, I-I messed up in there.

1640
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,375
Okay? I-I did the wrong thing
and I, and I blew it

1641
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:40,416
and, uh, I just want to say I'm sorry,
and I...

1642
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,208
I apologize.

1643
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,000
Very well.

1644
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,083
Apology accepted.

1645
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,666
Good. We got that over.

1646
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:56,666
Is this the first time
you ever apologized to somebody like that?

1647
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,625
Mm.

1648
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,083
Huh. Be honest with you, my wife, uh,

1649
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,208
- she helped me with the phrasing.
- Mm-hmm.

1650
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:08,541
Well, she did a very nice job.
I want you to thank her for me.

1651
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:10,166
All right.

1652
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,500
And you know what I can't stand
about that man?

1653
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,583
What?

1654
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,041
- His face.

1655
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,375
I know what you mean. It's, uh...

1656
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,625
You know what I'm talking about.

1657
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,041
...in the expression.

1658
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:39,375
- Mm-hmm.
No,

1659
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:42,208
it's generation upon generation
of white entitlement

1660
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:45,958
<i>and privilege all encapsulated
in one, single,</i>

1661
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,583
simpering grin.

1662
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,000
But him with that woman on stand today,

1663
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,125
posturing and pretending like

1664
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,000
he's some sort of
savior for our people... Ooh!

1665
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,166
- RICHARD<i>: Unfortunately,</i>

1666
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,333
the jury did seem to eat it up.

1667
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,583
Yeah. That is a problem, isn't it?

1668
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,208
Didn't I see his name

1669
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,708
on the witness list at some point?

1670
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:20,750
Supposedly, Gary was planning on

1671
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,708
calling him a...

1672
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:30,125
Calling him as a material witness to
the agreement between O'Keefe and Loewen.

1673
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:34,666
Which means I will have him on cross.

1674
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,875
Which means
you're gonna have him on cross.

1675
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:59,125
Hey, have any of you guys
read about this deal

1676
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,541
that the Loewen Group made
with something called

1677
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:03,625
the "National Baptist Convention"?

1678
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,708
The National Baptist Convention?

1679
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,750
What... What is that?

1680
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,375
It's like, um, you know, like...

1681
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:11,958
an arm of the Black church.

1682
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:13,791
But a really big one.

1683
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,000
Probably the biggest, actually.

1684
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,666
Sorry, did you-- did you just say

1685
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:20,416
that the Loewen Group has a deal
with the Black church?

1686
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:24,166
The, uh, National Baptist Convention.
But yeah.

1687
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:27,166
Yeah, how? How does that make any sense?

1688
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:28,791
I don't know.

1689
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:30,750
But it's all right here.

1690
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,916
Apparently, they created
some sort of partnership

1691
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,708
about a year ago.

1692
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:38,625
Hard to say why, though.

1693
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,833
Okay, can you get me
some more information about this?

1694
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,125
Yes, sir.

1695
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,875
Are the plaintiffs ready
to call their next witness?

1696
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:53,041
Yes.
Actually, Your Honor, we'd like to call

1697
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:56,625
Mr. O'Keefe's longtime attorney,
Michael Allred, to the stand.

1698
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,041
Your Honor.

1699
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:00,458
Seriously?

1700
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,666
Where are you going with this,
Mr. Douglas?

1701
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,541
Your Honor, we-we recognize
how this might seem a little unusual.

1702
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:09,041
However, Mr. Allred was with Mr. O'Keefe,

1703
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:12,083
as his attorney, the entire time
he was dealing with Loewen.

1704
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,500
And, uh, we feel like his-his testimony
will be essential.

1705
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,833
Michael Allred.

1706
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:24,041
Oh, hell, we friends. I'm-a call you Mike.

1707
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,166
- You bet, Reggie.

1708
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:28,208
So, Mike,

1709
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,291
in your 30 years of practicing law,

1710
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:34,041
specializing in contract law,

1711
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:37,375
did it ever occur to you,
when you were drawing up the contract

1712
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,583
between Mr. O'Keefe and Mr. Loewen,
that there could be

1713
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:44,250
any kind of misunderstanding as to what
that document actually was?

1714
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,708
No, sir.

1715
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,375
It was extremely clear to everyone
exactly what it was.

1716
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,916
It was a contract.

1717
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:52,125
Contract. It's a contract.

1718
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,708
Now, was there anything that suggested,
in the language,

1719
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:57,416
that the, uh,
agreed-upon time for the deal to close

1720
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:59,916
would be... open-ended?

1721
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:02,875
How's it feel to be sitting in that chair?

1722
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,083
- It's a little uncomfortable, yeah.
Mm.

1723
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,916
Imagine, we haven't even
gotten started yet.

1724
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:18,750
You've been Mr. O'Keefe's attorney
quite some time now, yes?

1725
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,333
I have.

1726
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,041
For 30 years-- nearly 30 years.

1727
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:23,250
Mm.

1728
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,375
And would you say you
and Mr. O'Keefe are good friends?

1729
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,083
- Sure. He's one of my closest friends.
- Hmm.

1730
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,291
Yeah, we share a lot in common.

1731
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:32,083
I admire him.

1732
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,958
Mr. Allred, would you say
this is a case about race?

1733
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:42,125
-  Objection. Objection.
- Objection.

1734
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,333
Overruled.

1735
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,166
Would I say this is a case about race?

1736
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:49,791
No, I would not say
this is a case about race.

1737
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,958
Really?

1738
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:58,791
Okay, well, the subject of race does seem
to keep coming up, doesn't it?

1739
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,833
Almost exclusively from your side.

1740
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:04,500
Uh, for instance,
this whole heroic narrative

1741
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,833
about, uh, Mr. O'Keefe supposedly
having some sort of civil rights record

1742
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,958
and denying the KKK a permit...

1743
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:15,083
Uh, explain to me what relevance that has
to a case about contracts.

1744
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,625
Uh, about Jerry's character.

1745
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,125
It's more about his integrity

1746
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,583
- and his decency.
'Cause he does

1747
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:21,666
such great things for Black people, huh?

1748
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,625
- Object-Objection.
Objection, Your Honor.

1749
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:24,875
Stand up.
- Objection. I'm not standing up.

1750
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,000
- I said "objection."
I will not allow

1751
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,291
this line of questioning, Ms. Downes.

1752
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:28,375
- Sustained.
I'm-I'm objecting.

1753
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,458
Another thing that has been
made quite clear in this case is

1754
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:34,458
how important family, family legacy,

1755
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,291
is to Mr. O'Keefe.

1756
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:38,083
Is that something you share?

1757
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,875
Family important to you as well?

1758
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,625
Well, it's not just important to me,
it's everything to me.

1759
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,333
It's everything. Well, that's something
you and Mr. O'Keefe have in common.

1760
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,458
- Objection.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1761
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,083
Because you're best friends, yeah?

1762
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,083
Overruled.
The witness can answer the question,

1763
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,416
but let's try and get to the point.

1764
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,708
Absolutely, it's something
that we share in common.

1765
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,875
I-Is this really what you want
to be asking me, Ms. Downes?

1766
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,583
It is.

1767
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:58,791
Actually.

1768
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,125
But thank you.

1769
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,583
You love your family.

1770
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:03,708
Yeah?

1771
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:06,416
Your extended family,
your immediate family--

1772
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:08,166
you love all of your family, yes?

1773
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:09,458
Every member of my family.

1774
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,541
Yeah?

1775
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:16,083
So, there-there's no one
that you secretly wish you could disown?

1776
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,375
Someone that you're maybe
- Objection, Your Honor.

1777
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,791
- a little ashamed...
- It doesn't matter what he feels.

1778
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:20,041
Disown?
- She doesn't know what...

1779
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,000
'Cause I know I have some family members
I would love to disown.

1780
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,541
- But you don't.
I'm-a take care of this.

1781
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:24,625
No.
- No? You don't.

1782
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:25,833
No.

1783
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,833
Say, for instance, your grandfather.

1784
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,875
- My grandfather.
Yes.

1785
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,625
Your grandfather.

1786
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:41,083
He was my grandfather.
What does that have to do with this case?

1787
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,291
Remind me:

1788
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,208
how long was your grandfather
a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

1789
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:56,041
- Objection. Objection.
- Objection. Objection.

1790
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,166
- Objection.

1791
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,666
- We gonna stop this right now.
Your Honor, I am gonna continue

1792
01:18:58,666 --> 01:18:59,875
- to say "objection."
- This is wrong.

1793
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:00,958
- Objection.

1794
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:02,500
Objection. Objection.

1795
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,583
- Did you bond with your grandfather

1796
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,416
about the KKK?

1797
01:19:06,416 --> 01:19:07,500
- Did you share some bond?
- What is the question?

1798
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,375
- What is the question?
- Did you share some love

1799
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,166
about the burning cross?

1800
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:14,458
You go to any, uh, KKK rallies
with your grandfather,

1801
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,750
- Mr. Allred?
Now, you know

1802
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,875
this is out of line,
it has nothing to do with this case.

1803
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,083
Objection.

1804
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,250
- Overruled, Mr. Gary.
- How can you overrule that?

1805
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,375
Answer the question, Mr. Allred.

1806
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:23,333
With all due respect, Your Honor,
this has nothing to do with the case.

1807
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:25,250
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?

1808
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:28,750
Are you asking me was I aware that my
grandfather was once a member of the KKK?

1809
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,041
Mike, you don't have
to answer that question.

1810
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,416
Objection.

1811
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,458
I heard you the first time, Mr. Gary.

1812
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,000
Yes, I was asking that question.

1813
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,291
I am no longer asking that question.

1814
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:38,958
- No further questions.

1815
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:41,500
What his grandfather has done...
You know, lawyer to lawyer,

1816
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,291
that was completely out of line,
Ms. Downes.

1817
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:44,958
Oh, the hypocrisy.

1818
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,458
The hypocrisy.

1819
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,291
- It's quite outrageous, Your Honor.

1820
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:52,291
Room full of brothers right now.

1821
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:53,750
- Denounce your granddaddy.
Yeah.

1822
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,208
Say it, Mike. Say it.

1823
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,166
Go on. It's easy.

1824
01:19:58,166 --> 01:19:59,666
- Come on, Mike. Denounce him.
- Yeah.

1825
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,083
You know what?

1826
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,375
I'm sorry.

1827
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,750
All right?

1828
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,125
I'm sorry.

1829
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,583
Her behavior was unconscionable.

1830
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:08,291
You cannot hold someone responsible

1831
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:10,375
for the mistakes of their ancestors.

1832
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:14,083
Mike, your granddaddy is a racist,

1833
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,666
land-stealing, slave-raping

1834
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,291
piece of shit. -Oh, come on now,
Reggie Douglas, that's not right!

1835
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,791
That's not right.
He's still my granddaddy.

1836
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:21,875
- I wouldn't say that about...
- Don't you bring...

1837
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,250
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Don't you bring up on me!

1838
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,750
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Stop all this.

1839
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,666
Stop it right now. Stop it.

1840
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,583
Reg, you stop. All of y'all.

1841
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:33,666
Mike, we not fixin' to crucify you...

1842
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,625
about what happened in the past.

1843
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,958
He can't fix his grandfather
or anything else.

1844
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,916
But you know what we can fix?

1845
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,208
This case.

1846
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:42,625
Hold on.

1847
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:43,791
Hold on, man.

1848
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:46,041
So you-you fixin' to give him a pass?

1849
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,416
- That was this is?
- I'm-a give him a pass

1850
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:49,041
because you didn't know enough
about his past

1851
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:50,708
and that's why you got your ass kicked.

1852
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,291
- Fuck this case, man.
- I think we can win.

1853
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:56,791
No, man, I'm going back to Florida. Nah.

1854
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,208
Doing exactly what we should've did
in the beginning. -Come on, man.

1855
01:20:58,208 --> 01:21:00,375
I got a question for you, Reggie:

1856
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:02,458
What's taking you so long
to get out the door?

1857
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,791
Wow.

1858
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,250
- Willie...
- You don't have to tell me twice.

1859
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,833
Have fun with these white folks.

1860
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,041
- Reg.
- Hey, Reggie.

1861
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,291
Reg!

1862
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,791
You want to go, too?

1863
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:15,166
You know what?

1864
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,291
I'm out.

1865
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:18,500
I'm tired of this shit.

1866
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,791
I'm out, too.

1867
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,541
I miss home, anyway.

1868
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:24,041
Willie, I'm gettin' too old
for this shit, man.

1869
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:27,250
Mike, I'm sorry.

1870
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,625
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1871
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,791
Me, too.

1872
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,791
Can't have this.

1873
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,291
Have what?

1874
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:38,750
We got a case.

1875
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,041
To win.

1876
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:50,166
I should probably...

1877
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,083
- I should probably recuse myself.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1878
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,583
- Mike, no, you can't do that.
- Yeah, I probably should.

1879
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,041
- No, Mike, you can't do that.
- I should, shouldn't I?

1880
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:58,416
Now, we got a long way to go,
but we can win this case.

1881
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:00,833
If I even dare to step foot
in that courtroom again,

1882
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,458
the jury's never gonna see me,

1883
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,083
they're just gonna see
a guy with a sheet on his head.

1884
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,333
Listen, listen. We dug a hole.

1885
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,583
We dug a hole, but we can dig out of it.

1886
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,666
I'm sorry, Willie, I can't do it,
'cause we both know if I stay on,

1887
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:12,750
my presence is just gonna
hurt the case more,

1888
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,250
and I can't do that to you
and I sure can't do that to Jerry.

1889
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,083
Mm-hmm.

1890
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:23,750
All right.

1891
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,500
We'll have to win it without you.

1892
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,875
You're gonna.

1893
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:31,000
Halbert. Be good.

1894
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:54,208
Well, there you are.
I've been looking for you.

1895
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,791
This trial's not going
the way I wanted it to.

1896
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:07,416
I feel like I made a bad mistake.

1897
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,708
And I ought to be cutting my losses.

1898
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:16,333
I thought justice was blind.

1899
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:21,000
That I could hold Ray Loewen to his word
in a court of law.

1900
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:26,458
Make him pay.
But hell, I was the one turned out blind.

1901
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:29,708
I am sorry for putting you
through all this.

1902
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,166
You don't need to say sorry, Jeremiah.

1903
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,291
Not to me, anyway.

1904
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:42,375
I know who you are.

1905
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,541
- Have you told Willie yet?
- No.

1906
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:51,708
I think he goes home to Florida
on the weekends.

1907
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,625
Feel like I ought to tell him in person.

1908
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:57,958
I think that would be
the right thing to do.

1909
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,958
Hey, sorry. Um...

1910
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:14,625
- Wait, what's-what's in this one again?
- Um...

1911
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:19,708
It's that info you requested on Loewen's
deal with the National Baptist Convention.

1912
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:23,125
Actually, would you mind leaving
that one here with me?

1913
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,916
Really think it's over, boss?

1914
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,750
I don't think there's any way
we can win this case,

1915
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,375
and my guess is, Jerry's starting
to see it that way as well, so...

1916
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:10,916
You-you must be Mrs. Gary.

1917
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,916
- Yes.
- I hope you'll forgive me

1918
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:14,833
for just showing up like this, but, uh,

1919
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,625
I'm Jeremiah O'Keefe.

1920
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,875
Oh!

1921
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,125
- You mean Jerry.
- Yes, ma'am.

1922
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:24,750
The Jerry that my husband keeps
going on about!

1923
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,750
Uh, is Willie home, by the way?

1924
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,833
Oh, no, I'm afraid he's not.

1925
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:32,166
He's over at his mother's in Indiantown,
where he usually goes on Saturdays.

1926
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,416
Okay.

1927
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:35,333
Hey, I tell you what.
You give me a minute

1928
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,208
to grab my car keys.

1929
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:39,583
- I'll drive you there myself.
- Oh, no, please, no.

1930
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:41,458
I-I don't want to impose.

1931
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:46,541
Jerry, absolutely not.

1932
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,291
You family now.

1933
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:49,708
- Come on, now.

1934
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:58,750
Just entering Indiantown now.

1935
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,416
This where Willie's from?

1936
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:02,500
Where we're both from.

1937
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,666
Willie and I have had our differences.

1938
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,625
I want you to know
I think he's a remarkable man.

1939
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,041
- ...upside-down on a ledge.
- Right. Exactly.

1940
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:29,291
- No.

1941
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,916
I'm a mess.

1942
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:33,958
Know what I'm saying?
Everybody's going to Dallas.

1943
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:36,041
Ah...

1944
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,541
- Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.

1945
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:40,708
Hmm.

1946
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:45,333
Willie ever tell you
he's one of 11 siblings?

1947
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,083
- Mm-hmm.

1948
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,541
- Surely.
- Number six out of 11.

1949
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:54,833
Well, believe it or not,
I have 13 children of my own.

1950
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,375
Oh, my God.
- Do you now?

1951
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:58,541
I do.

1952
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:00,000
I say.

1953
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,958
- Ooh.

1954
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,833
Y'all have 26 kids between you.

1955
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:05,708
Well, then you know,

1956
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,791
there's always that one baby

1957
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:10,458
that, no matter what you do,

1958
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,916
is always clinging to you for dear life.

1959
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:15,666
Wrapped around the bottom of your leg,

1960
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:17,333
and can't let go.

1961
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:19,000
- Oh, man.

1962
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:22,375
That's my Willie.

1963
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:26,083
And look at where all that longing

1964
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:28,333
and desperation for love

1965
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,583
has gotten him now.

1966
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,083
{\an8}
My grandfather was a sharecropper.

1967
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:44,500
{\an8}
Uh-huh.

1968
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,166
{\an8}
My paternal grandfather.

1969
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,250
{\an8}- Mm-hmm.
- My namesake.

1970
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:52,916
I was eight years old,

1971
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:55,458
out there in them sugarcane fields,
you know?

1972
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:58,458
Working.

1973
01:27:58,458 --> 01:27:59,833
Me.

1974
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,333
4:30 in the morning, she'd wake me up,
man, get me out here.

1975
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:05,541
I wasn't no taller than this grass, man.

1976
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:07,791
That's how it all got started,
out there in the sugarcane.

1977
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,416
Reason I came all the way
out here, Willie, is 'cause I...

1978
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,416
Look, listen, listen, listen, listen.

1979
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:14,125
'Fore you even get there. I know.

1980
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,458
You want to drop the case.

1981
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,541
I know it's got to be a disappointment.

1982
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:22,625
But if there was any way that I thought...

1983
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,208
Look, look, listen, listen, Jerry.

1984
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:26,458
You-you... you don't understand, doc.

1985
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,541
Look...

1986
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:30,833
Now, I know you got to do
what you got to do.

1987
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,916
But at the same time,

1988
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,625
you just got to know that I know,

1989
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:38,083
down deep in my heart, that me and you
together, we could've did it.

1990
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,666
We could've took that company down, man.

1991
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,875
I just hope you know
how much I've enjoyed getting to know you.

1992
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:46,875
This one didn't roll our way.

1993
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,500
But getting to know you...

1994
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,625
was a... highlight.

1995
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:57,291
What-What's that noise?

1996
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,125
- Listen...

1997
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,708
Man...

1998
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:04,375
Hold on a second.

1999
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,500
Hey.

2000
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,666
HAL
Hello? Hey.

2001
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:08,833
Hal?

2002
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:11,416
Hello? Can you hear--
- Hal, I can barely hear you.

2003
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:13,291
Hey, are-are you with Jerry right now?

2004
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,541
Yeah. Yeah.

2005
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:15,625
- Good. Yes. Okay.
- Yes, I am.

2006
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:16,791
Do not let him drop the case.

2007
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:18,791
Hello?

2008
01:29:18,791 --> 01:29:20,041
Hal, can you hear me?

2009
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:23,916
- It's a bad connection.
- I said, do not let him drop the case.

2010
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,583
Just-just trust me, okay?

2011
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:27,750
I... I may have found something.

2012
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,041
Okay. Good, I'll call you.

2013
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,875
<i>Thank you all for taking the time</i>

2014
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:48,041
to speak with us, Mr. Soames.

2015
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,708
Everyone.

2016
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:51,666
What can you tell us about the deal

2017
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:55,208
that the Loewen Group made with
the National Baptist Convention?

2018
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:57,833
Well, nothing good ever come out of it.

2019
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,541
At least not for Black folks.
That's the truth.

2020
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,666
'Bout a year back,

2021
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:06,583
the Loewen Group connected with
some of the top leadership

2022
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:08,083
of the NBC.

2023
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,583
- National Baptist Convention?
Yes, sir.

2024
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:15,250
One of the largest single branches
of the Black church.

2025
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,458
They represent over 33,000 churches

2026
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,750
and more than eight million members.

2027
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:25,125
Anyway, they made a proposal to the NBC,

2028
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:28,625
told 'em that
if they could convince the Black church

2029
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:34,000
to endorse the Loewen Group
as their death care provider of choice,

2030
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,166
then they'd turn some of its members
into salesmen.

2031
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:39,791
Like, uh, teach 'em how to sell everything

2032
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:42,958
from graves to crypts to headstones

2033
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:46,833
and, uh, burial insurance
straight to their own people.

2034
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,666
And for every product they sold,

2035
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:51,250
- they could keep the commission.
Hmm.

2036
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,958
Wait a minute now, so the Loewen Group

2037
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:57,125
was taking poor Black people,
having them sell their funeral products

2038
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,875
to other poor Black people
for a commission.

2039
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:03,083
Course, they said it was all win-win.

2040
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,625
Help people out of poverty,

2041
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,875
boost economic empowerment.

2042
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:10,250
But it never did much for anybody.

2043
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,208
Except the Loewen Group, of course.

2044
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:13,375
Yeah.

2045
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:14,833
They was just trying to find another way

2046
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,583
to exploit Black folks

2047
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:18,958
in their most vulnerable moments.

2048
01:31:41,875 --> 01:31:44,041
You know what this right here is?

2049
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,166
Not sure.

2050
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:49,916
What it is, is a cemetery.

2051
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:52,708
Now, you can't tell from looking at it

2052
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:55,833
on account of the fact that
there's no headstones.

2053
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:57,750
Why's that?

2054
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:01,041
That's 'cause
it's a different kind of cemetery.

2055
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:04,500
It's an old slave burial ground.

2056
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,750
Everybody knows slaves didn't have
no money of their own

2057
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:11,041
to ever bury their loved ones
with a headstone.

2058
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,541
Though you can't really tell
by looking at it...

2059
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:18,625
...our entire history,

2060
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:22,083
history of Black people in the South,

2061
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:24,708
history of Black people in America...

2062
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,916
...of our slave ancestors, it's,

2063
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:31,208
it's all buried everywhere out here.

2064
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,375
Deep underground.

2065
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:37,166
Pretty much everywhere you look,
that's where our history is.

2066
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:40,458
In these vast, empty fields.

2067
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:46,250
In some places,
they put up all these statues.

2068
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,416
You know,
like all these Confederate monuments

2069
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:51,500
and statues you see everywhere.

2070
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:58,333
All the lot of 'em is put up right on top
of a slave burial field.

2071
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,458
Mm-hmm.

2072
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:04,125
It's like taking one history

2073
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,583
and putting it right on top of another.

2074
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:10,833
It's like taking one man's legacy,

2075
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:13,333
putting it on top of another.

2076
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:18,625
Till, one day, it gets pushed down so deep

2077
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,541
buried so deep...

2078
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:25,666
...can't no one ever find it no more.

2079
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:37,791
<i>Some of the members came to me</i>

2080
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,583
<i>and told me that</i>

2081
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,708
the actual cost of burying my father

2082
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:45,458
was gonna be much more than
what they said when I bought the policy.

2083
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:50,166
When I told them
that I didn't have the extra money,

2084
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:54,500
and I didn't know how long
it would take me to get it,

2085
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:59,041
they happily said
they'd keep the body on ice.

2086
01:33:59,041 --> 01:34:00,958
Rather than give me any comfort,

2087
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:02,750
the deacon assigned to be counselor

2088
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:06,791
used it as an opportunity to shove
a bunch of brochures in my face

2089
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:09,500
and try and recruit me
as a Loewen sales rep.

2090
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,666
Then, suddenly,
this man from the NBC shows up,

2091
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:14,750
asking if I've made
funeral arrangements and...

2092
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,500
if I'd be interested
in a Loewen burial package.

2093
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,708
He said I'd get a much better deal
if I paid upfront.

2094
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,666
Before my son died.

2095
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:27,500
Once my husband finally passed,

2096
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,583
that's when they said
that the package that I bought

2097
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:34,708
didn't cover the cost of embalming
or moving the body.

2098
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,416
The coffin I bought for my mom

2099
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:38,583
was the least expensive one.

2100
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:42,125
Come to find out

2101
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:45,083
the one they sold me was
three times more than average.

2102
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:50,541
Your own preacher come to you,
telling you you need something,

2103
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:53,125
and you religious, you believe it.

2104
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,500
Now, I understand that you are

2105
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,916
one of the analysts for the Loewen Group.

2106
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:02,000
You deal with
some of the high-level deals.

2107
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,708
Is that correct?

2108
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,208
- Yes, that's correct.
Mm-hmm.

2109
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:07,666
Also that you were, uh,

2110
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,375
one of the architects of this latest deal

2111
01:35:09,375 --> 01:35:11,333
that you had between the Loewen Group

2112
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:13,250
and the National Baptist Convention.

2113
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,250
- Is that right?
- Yes, I was.

2114
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Baptist?

2115
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:18,958
- No, not Baptist.
- No.

2116
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:20,250
- Christian, though, right?
- Yes.

2117
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,791
Yeah, yeah. We all Christian, right?

2118
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,250
We all believe in God. Amen?

2119
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,625
Amen.

2120
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,208
Here's the question, though.

2121
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:32,166
How much money did the Loewen Group

2122
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:36,041
project to make from this deal

2123
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:38,708
of them and the NBC?

2124
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,291
And remember...

2125
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:43,083
you're under oath.

2126
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:49,541
Uh, our original long-term projections
for that deal were somewhere around

2127
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:52,166
1... maybe $1.2 billion.

2128
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:54,666
$1.2 million?

2129
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,333
- $1.2 billion.
- $1.2...

2130
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,166
$1.2 billion?

2131
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,500
$1.2 billion, that's-that's good money.

2132
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,708
That's good money
for the Loewen Group, correct?

2133
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:05,041
- Yes.
- That's good money.

2134
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:07,875
That's good money. $1.2 billion.

2135
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:11,166
I thought you said "million,"
but you said "billion dollars."

2136
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:13,250
Uh...

2137
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,166
How much did you pay 'em?

2138
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,958
I'm sorry?

2139
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,541
I said, how much did you pay 'em?

2140
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:23,375
How much did the Loewen Group

2141
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,666
pay the National Baptist Convention

2142
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:28,333
as compensation as a result of the deal?

2143
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:36,208
I believe we made
about a $200,000 donation.

2144
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:41,916
The jury heard it.

2145
01:36:41,916 --> 01:36:44,208
We didn't have a defense for it.

2146
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:46,875
Oh, what a fucking mess.

2147
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,541
I'm gonna have to call Loewen.

2148
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:22,500
<i>Dealing with people honestly</i>

2149
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,541
is something that's always been
important to us.

2150
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:29,000
Do we seek to be tough competitors

2151
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,583
in an increasingly volatile market?

2152
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:31,875
Yes.

2153
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,791
But we don't cheat people.

2154
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:37,083
- That's not how we operate.
Mm.

2155
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:38,750
No further questions, Your Honor.

2156
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,708
- Your witness, Mr. Gary.
All right.

2157
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:45,541
Mr. Loewen, how you doing?

2158
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:47,791
- I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Gary.
- You look good in that suit, doc.

2159
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:49,125
That's that Armani, I can tell that

2160
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,208
- a mile away.

2161
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:53,083
Listen, I just want to thank you
for coming down here.

2162
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:55,041
I know you're really busy,

2163
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:56,958
and we appreciate it,
but it's good to have the big man here.

2164
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:01,416
Because, um, you know, we want to shine
some light on some of these dark places.

2165
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:03,166
And, uh,
I'll just start right off with it.

2166
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:05,958
I want to know, from your perspective...

2167
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:10,500
...what was the deal that you had
between you and Mr. O'Keefe?

2168
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,416
I believe it was roughly a year ago

2169
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:17,958
when we received an enquiry

2170
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:21,375
from a representative of Mr. O'Keefe's.

2171
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:23,875
In fact,

2172
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:28,250
I'm pretty sure it was his lawyer,
Mr. Allred, who contacted us.

2173
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:30,666
My understanding is

2174
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,166
they were very anxious to sell.

2175
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:36,291
So we started looking into the deal.

2176
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:38,000
Sussing it out.

2177
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,916
Trying to determine if it was something

2178
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,875
that would be a good fit for our business.

2179
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:49,166
Sometime after that,
I invited Mr. O'Keefe and his associates

2180
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:50,875
up to Vancouver.

2181
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:54,166
If I recall, they came for dinner,

2182
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:57,041
at my boat, and we discussed things.

2183
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:01,791
After that, uh, hard to say.

2184
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:05,708
Normally, at that stage, I turn things
over to my acquisitions team.

2185
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:09,125
Well, that's pleasant.

2186
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:10,958
I mean, that really is.

2187
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,375
And...

2188
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,708
...lucky for you,

2189
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:17,250
uh, Mr. Loewen, I don't have
a lot of follow-up questions.

2190
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:20,833
I just have, uh, one thing
I want to ask you. Uh...

2191
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:23,791
What kind of boat?

2192
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,791
Come again?

2193
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:27,666
Oh, I said: "What kind of boat?"

2194
01:39:28,666 --> 01:39:31,250
You-you said earlier that you guys
were all on the boat together,

2195
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,750
and y'all was eating
and having a good time,

2196
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,500
having the best fish,

2197
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,375
and I just wanted to know,
what kind of boat is it?

2198
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:37,875
I don't understand.

2199
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,500
Are you asking
about the particular make, or...

2200
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:44,083
Matter of fact, I was asking...

2201
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:48,416
Can I read from this?
It says, "Nine sunning decks."

2202
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:50,750
Mm. "Six elegant staterooms."

2203
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,166
- Uh...
- Objection, Your Honor.

2204
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:53,250
- What is the relevance...
-"Five luxury guest cabins."

2205
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,500
- ...of the witnesses' boat?
- Overruled.

2206
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,583
Your Honor,
can I just read what the boat is?

2207
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:57,041
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- It's a nice boat.

2208
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,875
- Overruled.
- I just want to recognize

2209
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:01,625
and let everybody see
that it's a very nice boat.

2210
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:04,458
You got, uh, helicopter, helicopter pad.

2211
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,625
You can land a helicopter

2212
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:06,916
- on that thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

2213
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:08,041
That's something else right there.

2214
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:09,375
That's high grass.

2215
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:12,541
How much did, uh,
how much did this boat of yours cost?

2216
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:16,458
I really don't know.

2217
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:18,208
I think we're...

2218
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,708
You're not understanding the question.

2219
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:22,500
I'm... Let me frame it again
so you can understand it better.

2220
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,333
I'm asking you

2221
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:26,458
how much did you pay

2222
01:40:26,458 --> 01:40:28,583
for your boat?

2223
01:40:29,666 --> 01:40:30,958
I don't know.

2224
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:32,041
Objection. -RAY: I don't know.
- Can I ask...

2225
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:33,916
Asked and answered.
- You know what? Forget about that.

2226
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,083
Let me ask you this:

2227
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:37,375
How much you pay for your plane? Huh?

2228
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,416
Since you can remember some things
and you forget other things,

2229
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:40,666
how much you pay for your plane?

2230
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:43,166
How much did you pay
for your plane, Mr. Gary?

2231
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:44,458
I saw it on the runway.

2232
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:45,583
Oh. You know what?

2233
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:47,250
We could talk about how much
I paid for my plane,

2234
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,875
'cause I know exactly how much it was,

2235
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,375
but we not talking
about my plane right now.

2236
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:52,041
We talking about your boat.

2237
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:54,250
So, let me ask one more time,

2238
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,333
so everybody can hear
and understand what I'm saying

2239
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:58,500
to Mr. Loewen, the billionaire

2240
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,916
who doesn't know the price of his own boat

2241
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:03,083
that he had dinner on with his colleagues.

2242
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:06,541
I want to ask you again:
how much did you pay

2243
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:08,000
for your boat?

2244
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:11,083
I don't know.

2245
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:14,833
I think he's not hearing what I'm saying.

2246
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:16,333
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
Mr. Loewen.

2247
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:18,000
How much did your boat cost?

2248
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:21,250
What is your point?

2249
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:22,500
What's my point?

2250
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,625
What is my point?

2251
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:27,541
While you were sitting there sunning
on that $25 million boat,

2252
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:31,208
eating your $30 a head lobster,

2253
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,500
did it ever bother you
that it was all being paid for

2254
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,750
by all the poor people
and destitute people

2255
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:39,208
that your company was
systematically taking advantage of

2256
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:41,041
and profiting from every single day?

2257
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,791
Objection! Counsel is testifying.
- Huh? Not only that,

2258
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,666
they were taking advantage of 'em
at their worst time,

2259
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:48,291
when they're downtrodden,
when they lost somebody,

2260
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:49,958
when they're mourning somebody.

2261
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,708
And now, who has to pay for it?

2262
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:54,458
The small businessman
like Jeremiah O'Keefe.

2263
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:56,333
The small businessman in this country,

2264
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:58,625
who worked so hard to pay for everything

2265
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,250
and stay on top and keep afloat

2266
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,041
while these greedy corporations

2267
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,000
do everything they can and...

2268
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,291
Objection, Your Honor!

2269
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:08,500
I think I've had quite enough of this.

2270
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,583
Sit your ass down!

2271
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,291
- You sit your ass down

2272
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,583
until I finish what I'm saying,
because I'm not done.

2273
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,458
I'm not done with my question
by a long shot. -Mr. Gary!

2274
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:20,416
Language of that nature
will not be tolerated in my court.

2275
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:25,125
Mr. Loewen, you may not leave
the witness stand

2276
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,333
unless you're excused by me.

2277
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:29,208
Do you understand?

2278
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:42,875
You may continue, Mr. Gary,

2279
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:45,083
but I warn you to tread lightly.

2280
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,541
I just want to know one thing.

2281
01:43:13,166 --> 01:43:15,541
Did it ever bother you at all?

2282
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,000
No.

2283
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,500
- That's all I need.

2284
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:37,166
You're dismissed.

2285
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:48,500
Motherfucker!

2286
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,333
Motherfucker!

2287
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:53,083
What was that? What was that?!

2288
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:55,166
I was skewered out there!

2289
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:06,083
Well, Sister Souljah, what you got for me?

2290
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:08,750
Well, came to let you know
we've come to a decision.

2291
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,208
Mm. We have? And what have we decided?

2292
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:13,500
Well, in light of recent events,

2293
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,083
it does feel that it would be best
for all parties involved...

2294
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,375
- Oh.
- ...to reopen a settlement discussion.

2295
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:23,375
In other words, we are...

2296
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:25,625
we are prepared to make your client

2297
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:28,250
- a very generous offer.

2298
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:32,125
I know that's hard for you to, uh,
get out, but how generous are we talking?

2299
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:34,500
I mean, work with me, Willie.
It's not gonna be $100 million.

2300
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,916
Work with you? What are you talking about?

2301
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:37,458
I mean, needless to say,

2302
01:44:37,458 --> 01:44:39,875
it's gonna be in the range
in which neither Jerry... -Uh-huh.

2303
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:41,375
...nor his kids
nor his grandkids would ever

2304
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,750
- have to worry about anything again.
- Okay.

2305
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:45,041
- That sound good. That sound good.
- Yes.

2306
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:47,041
I'll tell you what.

2307
01:44:47,041 --> 01:44:49,208
Why don't we meet in your room
in a couple hours?

2308
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:53,375
And make sure you get
your best negotiator. You know why?

2309
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:57,125
Your ass gonna need it.

2310
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:02,458
Generally, damages in tort are awarded

2311
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:04,666
simply to restore the plaintiff
back to the position

2312
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:06,666
he or she was in before tort occurred.

2313
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:11,333
However, given how protracted
this whole matter has become,

2314
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:13,625
we believe that it is
in all our best interests

2315
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:15,625
just to resolve this once and for all.

2316
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:18,083
We'd like to make you what we consider

2317
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:19,958
a very generous offer.

2318
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:22,083
Obviously,
should you decide not to take it,

2319
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,250
we can all go back into court tomorrow.

2320
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,166
You can roll the dice with the jury.

2321
01:45:26,166 --> 01:45:29,333
But, frankly, uh,
the chances that you will win

2322
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:31,750
or come anywhere close to this number,

2323
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:34,000
is a risk I doubt you want to take.

2324
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,375
Okay.

2325
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,916
Here's our offer.

2326
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,375
The answer's no.

2327
01:46:11,416 --> 01:46:13,541
Are you serious?

2328
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:14,833
He's serious?

2329
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,416
I said the answer's no.

2330
01:46:16,416 --> 01:46:19,791
You mean to tell me you are
really going to turn that down?

2331
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,916
You sure you don't maybe want
a little more time to think it over?

2332
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:25,666
I've thought it over enough.
Have you?

2333
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:29,041
I think we both know that's more money
than you'll ever see in your lifetime.

2334
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:31,500
We gonna get down to business
or y'all gonna keep wasting our time?

2335
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,750
- The man said no.

2336
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:34,833
Hmm?

2337
01:46:36,666 --> 01:46:38,541
- Mm. Okay.

2338
01:46:40,791 --> 01:46:42,625
- You sure?
- Yes.

2339
01:46:54,458 --> 01:46:56,625
Best and final.
Mm-hmm.

2340
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:32,291
Answer's still no.

2341
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:36,250
Well, this is just fucking unbelievable.

2342
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:38,375
What the hell's your problem, O'Keefe?

2343
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:41,041
You can't honestly tell me
that is not enough.

2344
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:42,583
It's more than enough for me.

2345
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:44,125
It's just not enough for you.

2346
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:45,708
For me?

2347
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:47,500
As in enough to put you out of business.

2348
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,000
Ah.

2349
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,625
Come on.

2350
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:52,458
Let me tell you something, pal.

2351
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:55,875
The amount of money it would take
to put me out of business--

2352
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:58,708
the real, actual amount--

2353
01:47:58,708 --> 01:48:00,875
is a number you can't even calculate.

2354
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,625
Take the money, Jerry.

2355
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:04,333
You're 80 years old.

2356
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:06,666
- Seventy-five.
- Can you please talk to your client?

2357
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:08,000
Talk to him about what?

2358
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,666
- About the fact he just turned down...
- Oh, he said no.

2359
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:11,375
Last I checked, "no" means "no," right?

2360
01:48:11,375 --> 01:48:13,208
What does it feel like

2361
01:48:13,208 --> 01:48:16,916
to be some small-time, nobody
funeral director

2362
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:18,916
on the verge of bankruptcy

2363
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:22,541
who just passed on
his one and only chance

2364
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:25,500
at $75 million?

2365
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,541
- What's it feel like?

Okay, you can leave now. Thank you.

2382
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,041

<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

2397
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:44,041
Done a lot of big cases, but...

2398
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,666
...this particular one is...

2399
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:54,000
Lot of people's lives in my hand. And...

2400
01:49:55,708 --> 01:49:58,125
I think I kind of feel that
a little bit, you know.

2401
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:02,416
Especially...

2402
01:50:02,416 --> 01:50:04,208
especially when it comes to Jerry.

2403
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,333
So...

2404
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:14,000
I don't want to lose.

2405
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,083
I mean, I don't...

2406
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,916
I-I think...

2407
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:21,291
...what if I don't win

2408
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:23,041
and...

2409
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:26,541
...I let all these people down?

2410
01:50:29,083 --> 01:50:31,708
Well...

2411
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,750
you're not going to let them down.

2412
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,833
So you don't need to worry.

2413
01:50:41,916 --> 01:50:45,375
You know that for a fact, Miss Gloria?

2414
01:50:45,375 --> 01:50:47,375
I don't know it for a fact.

2415
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,333
- I know you for a fact.
- Mm.

2416
01:50:55,416 --> 01:50:57,416
I know the man I married.

2417
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:00,291
Yeah, baby.

2418
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:05,041
Oh, but...

2419
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:08,166
One suggestion, though, baby?

2420
01:51:08,166 --> 01:51:10,375
Yeah? What's that?

2421
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,916
When you're up there in court tomorrow,

2422
01:51:14,916 --> 01:51:16,750
- doing your thing...
- Doing my thing.

2423
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:22,000
...just...

2424
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,333
try not to refer to yourself
in the third person.

2425
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:29,333
Okay.

2426
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:34,291
- What, um...

2427
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:35,541
What you, what you talking about, Gloria?

2428
01:51:35,541 --> 01:51:37,583
I don't, I don't do that.

2429
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:39,458
- Yeah, you do.
- Go on.

2430
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:41,041
- Nah, I...
- Just a little.

2431
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:44,166
I don't think I do that.

2432
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:46,291
I don't.

2433
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:49,291
"Girl, get ready.
Willie Gary coming upstairs now!"

2434
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:52,125
- Trust me.

2435
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:53,666
You do.

2436
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:58,458
I... I guess Willie Gary does do that
every once in a while.

2437
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:32,833
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

2438
01:52:35,208 --> 01:52:37,625
...I just have one small question to ask.

2439
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:43,666
Do y'all mind if I keep things simple?
Hmm?

2440
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:46,375
Just plain and ordinary talk.

2441
01:53:12,125 --> 01:53:14,000
<i>Has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

2442
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,833
{\an8}After careful consideration,

2443
01:53:20,833 --> 01:53:25,166

2450
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:52,833
...to be paid to Mr. O'Keefe
by defendant Loewen Group, LLC.

2451
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:56,250
And...

2452
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:03,541
...a verdict of $400 million
in punitive damages

2453
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:07,458

by defendant Loewen Group.

2454
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,666
You deserve it.

01:54:08,666 --> 01:54:09,750
Come on!

2456
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:09,250
$500 million, Jerry.

2457
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,458
I know it, Willie.

2458
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:17,541
I know it.

2459
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:50,916
Hey, Willie.

2460
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:53,833
Hey, Mame.

2461
01:55:53,833 --> 01:55:55,958
What you do, you, uh...

2462
01:55:55,958 --> 01:55:57,416
come down here for your last licking?

2463
01:55:57,416 --> 01:55:59,083
- Oh, my last licking?

2464
01:55:59,083 --> 01:56:00,583
No.

2465
01:56:00,583 --> 01:56:02,291
I actually just wanted
to congratulate you.

2466
01:56:02,291 --> 01:56:03,458
Really?

2467
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:04,958
- Yeah.
- Congratulate me?

2468
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,208
Mm-hmm.

2469
01:56:06,208 --> 01:56:08,166
Now come on. You mean that?

2470
01:56:08,166 --> 01:56:10,250
Listen, I hate losing.

2471
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:13,166
But it was a well-earned victory.
I can be honest about that.

2472
01:56:13,166 --> 01:56:16,125
Well, I venture, but that's $500 million.

2473
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:20,000
Now, somewhere inside,
I know you think that's way too much.

2474
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:24,625
Yeah, maybe there's a part of me
that thinks it's not enough.

2475
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:27,083
- Well, I can take more.

2476
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:29,250
Good luck to you, Willie Gary.

2477
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:30,958
Ah. Keep in touch.

2478
01:56:30,958 --> 01:56:32,500
