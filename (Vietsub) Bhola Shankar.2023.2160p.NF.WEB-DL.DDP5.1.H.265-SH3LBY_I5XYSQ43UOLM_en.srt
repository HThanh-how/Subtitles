1
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,958
- Devi!
- Devi!

2
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,750
- Devi!
- Devi!

3
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,250
Excuse me!
Have you seen my daughter?

4
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,708
- No, madam.
- Devi!

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,291
She was right here!

6
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,291
Where could she have gone?

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,875
- Madam! I can't find my daughter.
- Yes?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,041
{\an8}It was me who called you.

9
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,166
They live in our colony.
It's their daughter who is missing.

10
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,916
- Yes, sir!
- My daughter, sir. She is seventeen.

11
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,500
She has been missing for three hours, sir.

12
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,125
{\an8}- Do you have her photograph?
<i>- Over…</i>

13
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,916
{\an8}<i>A girl is missing</i>
<i>from Howrah Bridge. Over!</i>

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,791
{\an8}Another girl is reported missing
near Howrah Bridge, sir.

15
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,375
Lodge a complaint
with Kalighat Police Station.

16
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,291
{\an8}- Okay? Hurry up!
- Yes, sir!

17
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,333
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
{\an8}Kidnappings are wreaking havoc in Kolkata.

19
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,833
{\an8}Kidnappings are increasing day by day.

20
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,083
<i>So far, 63 girls have gone missing.</i>

21
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,083
So many girls have been kidnapped

22
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,416
that parents are unwilling
to let their daughters go out.

23
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,541
{\an8}What is their modus operandi?

24
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,708
{\an8}Not a single arrest
has been made so far, sir.

25
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,625
Exactly!

26
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:08,916
No leads,

27
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,958
no informer, no clue!

28
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,750
Okay, sir.
I will take care of that.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,375
Sir, with so many girls being kidnapped,
why are you turning a blind eye?

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,916
What are the police doing, sir?

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,416
The Home Minister
has taken this kidnapping issue seriously.

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,291
They have appointed a special officer.

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,666
{\an8}We'll take care of it!
Don't worry.

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,833
<i>Hello, Charles!</i>

35
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,833
{\an8}- I have important information for you.
- Tell me.

36
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,458
My wife wants diamonds.

37
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,625
Send me the quotation.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,916
I will make the payment.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,625
{\an8}Expect a raid tomorrow.

40
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,000
Most welcome.

41
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,583
- Search every container.
- Okay, sir.

42
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,500
- You go there!
- Sir!

43
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,208
Someone has given you
the wrong information, sir.

44
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,708
This port is under my control, sir.

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,416
There is nothing suspicious here.

46
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,375
Fool!

47
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,708
When someone inquires about our business,

48
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,791
we receive their biodata instantly
within the next minute.

49
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,666
Why do officers like you risk their lives?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,750
Is it for the medals
that the government gives?

51
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,458
I am willing to take any kind of risk
to apprehend criminals like you.

52
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,916
You are exploiting girls for business!

53
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,291
No, it's not just a business!

54
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,583
It's an empire!

55
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,375
No one can touch it!

56
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,833
Mother Kali is watching you from above.

57
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,833
I might die, but another will arise!

58
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,083
But to challenge us…

59
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,500
an ordinary person won't be enough.

60
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,166
You'll need a gangster, a monster,
a bigger destroyer than me.

61
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,708
If such a being exists on this planet,

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,333
go and ask Mother Kali to send him!

63
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,250
{\an8}Hail Mother Kali!

64
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,583
- Hey, Brother-in-law!
- Yes?

65
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,500
You mentioned a brother was coming
from Hyderabad.

66
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,041
Did you clear out the tenants?
Where is he?

67
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,041
Brother Shankar
has already arrived in Kolkata!

68
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,208
Look!

69
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,416
Mother Goddess and my brother
have come together.

70
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,708
Okay, okay.
What are they saying?

71
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,250
They consider you a God for saving
their children in the nick of time.

72
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,541
I did nothing.

73
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,125
It's all thanks
to the grace of Mother Goddess.

74
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,333
Commence the worship.

75
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,958
Carry on, carry on.
Begin the worship.

76
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,083
- Brother, he is my brother-in-law
- Oh!

77
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,750
- Come. Please, come.
- Okay!

78
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,416
Brother, where is your younger sister?

79
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,416
Sister… there she is…

80
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,583
Mahaa!

81
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,708
This brother and sister duo exudes energy!

82
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,500
You've won everyone's hearts
as soon as you stepped in, Dada Shankar.

83
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,708
Certainly, my brother cares
for everyone's well-being…

84
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,625
But he's no rowdy or <i>dada.</i>

85
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,750
He's Brother Shankar.

86
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,125
That's what my sister meant, Mahaa.

87
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,208
In Bengali, <i>dada</i> means brother.

88
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,166
Oh, really?

89
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,708
Then my brother is a <i>dada</i> to everyone.

90
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,375
This building is mine.

91
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,500
You'll be living upstairs.

92
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,875
This is a two-bedroom apartment.

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,083
- Two-bedroom, did you say?
- Yes! A bed here and another there!

94
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,375
- A two-bedroom!
- What about the living room?

95
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,750
Place a sofa, and you have a living room.

96
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,916
Put a stove there,
and it becomes a kitchen, right?

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,333
Very clever!

98
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,958
This is Kolkata.
That's how things are here.

99
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,125
Wow!

100
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,208
Beautiful!

101
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,083
Brother! Look at the Howrah Bridge view!

102
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,125
Oh, that's nice.

103
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,625
Do you like the house?

104
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,958
- Very much.
- Fine.

105
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,041
It's a two-bedroom house!

106
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,458
Great! So, you're fond of the house.

107
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,416
I am glad.

108
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,750
- Brother!
- Yes?

109
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,666
- Our pigeons will be here.
- Okay.

110
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,625
- Pigeons?
- Peacocks over here.

111
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,583
- Peacocks?
- Okay!

112
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,208
Squirrels and rabbits over there.

113
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay.

114
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,750
Squirrels and rabbits?

115
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,375
- What about the leopard?
- What? A leopard?!

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,125
Let's keep it at the doorstep.

117
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,791
Correct.

118
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,166
Have you brought along a zoo
from Hyderabad?

119
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,458
This is a residential complex,
not meant for animals.

120
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,541
Brother!

121
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,791
Hey, come here.

122
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,208
What?
Were you talking about paintings?

123
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,791
- Yes, my sister painted them all.
- Hey, hold them.

124
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,125
- When she paints, images come to life.
- Oh!

125
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,625
They said Kolkata
has the best university for Masters.

126
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,000
So, my brother has brought her here
for admission.

127
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,458
But the seat isn't confirmed.

128
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,750
I must try again tomorrow.

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,458
The seat isn't confirmed yet?

130
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,208
No problem.
Mother Kali will take care of everything.

131
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,125
By the way, your parents?

132
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,583
No mom, no dad.

133
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,166
- My brother is everything to me.
- Sir, the job is done.

134
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,625
Brother, the money.

135
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,916
- Here, give it to them.
- Okay!

136
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,916
- The rent is ten thousand.
- I'll pay it.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,083
- Let's go!
- The advance is twenty thousand.

138
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,041
I'll pay that too.

139
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,166
Rent should be paid by the fifth.

140
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,875
- I'll pay it on the first.
- Give it to me then.

141
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,666
This is for my sister's tuition fee.

142
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,416
If you want this, I need to find a job.

143
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,500
What skills do you have?

144
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,750
My brother can drive.
He has a heavy vehicle license.

145
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,125
Brother-in-law!
You should find him a job.

146
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,250
You're well-acquainted with the owner
of the Bengali Taxi Company, right?

147
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,333
- Arrange a driver's job for him.
- Yes, Brother-in-law.

148
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,291
Great.

149
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,833
My brother-in-law recommends him
for the house and my wife for his job.

150
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,250
What can I do?
I'll secure the job for him!

151
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,833
I would like to meet Madam.

152
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,625
Madam is in a meeting.
Please wait.

153
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,666
{\an8}- Okay, you can go ahead.
- Thank you.

154
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,833
Mr. Mukherjee, please make sure
all arrangements are made.

155
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,916
- You can go now, sir.
- Okay, madam.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,833
And send me the details

157
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,666
- of the art exhibition, please.
- Yeah, sure.

158
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,833
- Namaste, madam.
- Good morning, madam!

159
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:36,750
Yes? Tell me.

160
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,875
{\an8}Madam! I'm seeking your help
with my sister's admission.

161
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,875
{\an8}It's already been two months
since the academic year started.

162
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,166
You are too late.

163
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
{\an8}Madam, if you're interested,

164
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,125
{\an8}she's a talented artist.

165
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,125
{\an8}Please take a look, madam.

166
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,250
Just moments ago, my sister painted this.

167
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,750
Isn't it impressive, madam?

168
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,041
Very talented.

169
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,708
{\an8}If I may,

170
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,166
{\an8}can I say something?

171
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,375
You bear a resemblance to Sharmila Tagore.

172
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,375
Brother!

173
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,958
Looks like Sharmila Tagore is impressed.

174
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Seat guaranteed.

175
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,166
{\an8}But how can we admit her
in the middle of the year?

176
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,625
I think we'll take her as a special case.

177
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,583
She has got very good marks too.

178
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,291
- We will give your sister admission.
- Thank you, ma'am.

179
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,458
Why are they all lined up?
Are they expecting some VIPs?

180
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,291
VVIP.

181
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,125
The head of this taxi company.

182
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,583
- Oh! He's the one giving me a job, right?
- Yes, and we're quite close.

183
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,416
Here he comes.

184
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
If he reached such a high position
at a young age,

185
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,625
he must have worked very hard.

186
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,250
Indeed, he worked extremely hard…

187
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,166
to woo the owner's daughter.

188
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,125
He initially worked as a driver.

189
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,250
That gentleman was the actual owner.

190
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,291
He asked this guy
to drop his daughter at college.

191
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,000
But this fellow made her fall in love.

192
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,041
The owner had no option
but to marry his daughter off.

193
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,833
This guy took the company
along with the girl.

194
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,500
So, this guy became
the driver of the girl's life,

195
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
while his father-in-law
became the driver of the car.

196
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,833
You're absolutely right!

197
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,208
- Impressive artist!
- Yes!

198
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,416
- I wonder what his name is.
- Mr. Bamsi!

199
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,958
Enough!
How many times have I told you?

200
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,333
It's not Bamsi, it's Mr. Vamsi!

201
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Bamsi!

202
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,375
These Bengalis can't seem
to pronounce anything other than "b."

203
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,333
Damn it!

204
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,291
Say whatever you want!

205
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,833
You…

206
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,791
Bamsi!

207
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,083
My baby!

208
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,083
Baby!

209
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,625
Why did you leave without waking me up?

210
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,791
You were in a deep sleep,
looking peaceful.

211
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
I didn't want to disturb you.

212
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,833
I am missing your morning hug, baby.

213
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,958
I'll make sure
to give you a tight hug in the evening.

214
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,208
Are you standing in the sun, baby?

215
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,458
You might get a tan.

216
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,083
Dad, hold the umbrella for him.

217
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,291
Thank you, baby.

218
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,541
You're so caring.

219
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,208
- I love you!
- Greetings, sir.

220
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,916
<i>Love you too, baby!</i>

221
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:55,916
- Baby…
- Sir…

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,916
Shut up!

223
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,083
Why are you bothering me
while I'm on the phone with my baby?

224
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,541
- Shouldn't you have some basic sense?
- I should.

225
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,458
<i>- Who is it, baby?</i>
- Sorry, baby.

226
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,666
Someone wants a selfie.

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,041
- You know how fans…
- I am nervous, brother.

228
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,291
- I'm here for you. Come.
<i>- Bye, baby.</i>

229
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,500
Namaste, Mr. Vamsi.

230
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,875
Music to my ears.

231
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,166
For the first time in Kolkata,
someone called me by my name correctly.

232
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,375
Everyone usually says,
"Bamsi sir, Bamsi sir!"

233
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,916
Learn from him.

234
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,291
That's why I love Telugu people.

235
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,083
Remember I mentioned
someone was coming from Hyderabad?

236
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,875
I meant for a job. This is the guy.

237
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,375
What's your name, little brother?

238
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,083
Elder brother!

239
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,208
Younger brother!

240
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,125
Elder brother!

241
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,625
Younger brother!

242
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,791
Elder brother!

243
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,916
Younger brother!

244
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,333
Elder brother!

245
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,500
Younger brother!

246
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,666
You're the first
to call me "little brother," brother.

247
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,375
And you're the first
to address me as "elder brother," brother!

248
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,458
- This bond goes beyond this lifetime.
- Younger brother!

249
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,916
It's not going to end now.

250
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,333
He's Shankar, sir.

251
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,833
A true embodiment of the Telugu spirit.

252
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,791
Sit.

253
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,125
Have a seat.

254
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,000
You look so innocent and gentle.

255
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,166
{\an8}- Drivers have to be rough and tough.
- That's true.

256
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,833
{\an8}Look at my hand, how rough it is.

257
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,750
{\an8}Oh, no!

258
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,583
{\an8}It's as rough as a handsaw!

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,291
{\an8}Your handshake could cut my hand!

260
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,916
{\an8}He used to drive until recently.
That's why.

261
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,458
Go and clean the car.

262
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,083
Brother, I don't drink.

263
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,458
{\an8}For drivers, drinking is a crime.

264
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,041
{\an8}- For owners, not drinking is just cruelty.
- Oh!

265
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,375
{\an8}How is my ideology?

266
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,541
Brother…

267
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,583
your wife is on the phone.

268
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,250
{\an8}She's not my wife, bro. She's like Wi-Fi.

269
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,625
{\an8}She's all around me, sapping my energy!

270
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,500
{\an8}She sends me juice but drains me down.

271
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,333
{\an8}A bloody vampire of the century…

272
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,000
Baby!

273
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,416
{\an8}<i>Did you get the juice, baby?</i>

274
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,250
{\an8}Yes, baby.
I'm having it now. See.

275
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,375
Baby!

276
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,916
I'm in an interview
for our business expansion.

277
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,500
{\an8}I will call you later, okay?

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,708
{\an8}- Bye!
<i>- Bye, baby!</i>

279
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,958
{\an8}- So, where were we?
- Right here.

280
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,583
{\an8}I mean… in the interview.

281
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,166
{\an8}Are you ready for the rapid-fire round?

282
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,833
Yes… brother.

283
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,333
You have a passenger
who's in a hurry to catch a flight.

284
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,125
{\an8}You need to drive him fast.

285
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,916
{\an8}He is panicking.

286
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,375
{\an8}Just then,
your phone starts ringing non-stop.

287
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,041
{\an8}What will you do?

288
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,041
{\an8}I'll drop the passenger at his destination

289
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,041
{\an8}- and call back the number…
- Okay.

290
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,541
{\an8}Hey, good-for-nothing, loser, idler!
Scoundrel! Useless!

291
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,291
{\an8}How many times do I need to tell you?
Don't you know I was driving?

292
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,333
{\an8}- And I'll use all the bad words I know.
- Okay…

293
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,916
{\an8}Whose number is it, brother?

294
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,958
{\an8}It's…mine.

295
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,791
{\an8}- Sorry, brother.
- It's okay.

296
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,208
{\an8}Brother, sorry, brother.
Please forgive me.

297
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,333
{\an8}It's okay.
I like your brutal honesty.

298
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,375
{\an8}You are selected.

299
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,291
Thanks, brother.

300
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,041
- This vampire is calling me again…
- Brother, your wife…

301
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,166
- Talk to her. Talk, man!
- No, no!

302
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,416
You just called me. You deserve a punch…

303
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,208
Baby!

304
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,583
<i>- Did you finish the interview, darling?</i>
- Yeah! He is selected.

305
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,458
You want to see the dynamic personality?

306
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,041
Here you go!

307
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,625
Greetings.

308
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,750
<i>Greetings, brother.</i>

309
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,291
Thanks a lot, sister.

310
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,166
If she called you "brother,"
you're really lucky, man.

311
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,291
You're right, brother.

312
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,375
The key…

313
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,250
<i>Take the key and start the car, brother.</i>

314
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,958
{\an8}Thank you, sister.
Thank you.

315
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,500
{\an8}Okay, baby. Bye.

316
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,666
{\an8}- How can he be so naive?
- I know.

317
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,333
{\an8}Oh, God! How will he survive in Kolkata?

318
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,208
{\an8}Okay, do one thing.

319
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,083
{\an8}I'll send you my photo on WhatsApp.

320
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,416
If you face any trouble,
look at it for confidence. Okay?

321
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,291
{\an8}But if things get worse,
you can show it to the other guy.

322
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,875
{\an8}He will get scared.

323
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,958
Thanks, brother.
Oh, no. No handshakes.

324
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,708
The handsaw will cut through me.

325
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:39,875
See you, sir!

326
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,083
Oh, God…

327
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,166
This baby…

328
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,750
Hello, Mahaa!
I've just started my duty.

329
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,041
Congrats, brother!

330
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,416
May your first passenger be the best one.

331
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,958
Hello! Senior!

332
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,583
Where are you?
It's time for the court.

333
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,625
My car broke down. I'm on my way.

334
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,666
I thought only her timing was bad.
But her luck is bad too.

335
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,666
Hey, taxi!

336
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,791
It's your first day today, right?

337
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,541
- Alright, take the trip.
- Thank you, brother.

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,916
Bansal Court.

339
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,458
- Drive quickly.
- Okay, ma'am!

340
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,125
- Juniors!
<i>- Senior?</i>

341
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,541
- Is the witness ready?
<i>- Ready, Senior.</i>

342
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,666
We must win this case no matter what.

343
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,625
<i>- Yes!</i>
- Prepare the witness thoroughly.

344
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,875
I am coming.

345
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,208
- Okay?
<i>- Okay, Senior!</i>

346
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,458
Are you Telugu, madam?

347
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,875
Yes.

348
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,208
- Drive faster, please.
- Okay!

349
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,125
- Come…
- Come, Senior. Let's go, Senior.

350
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,833
- Is the proxy witness ready?
- Ready, Senior.

351
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,250
- Oh, madam! My money! Madam…
- Hello…

352
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,375
There's no parking here.
It's over there.

353
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,416
Will the judge believe it?

354
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,041
He looks so innocent
that innocence itself will be surprised.

355
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,125
- Get moving!
- Okay!

356
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,291
Judging by his enthusiasm,
I feel confident we'll win the case.

357
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,166
Madam! We're going to win, right, madam?

358
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,833
Brother Ketan! I am the most popular
criminal lawyer.

359
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,333
Lasya…

360
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,250
My name itself carries "law."

361
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,333
It also carries "loss."

362
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey, didn't you tell him about me?

363
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,375
If I did,
we wouldn't be handling this case.

364
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,291
- Where is the witness?!
- Over there!

365
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,416
Good night. Good morning.

366
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,625
You said he was enthusiastic!

367
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,083
Why is he swaying?

368
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,625
He's active only when he's drunk, Senior.

369
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,958
He's the perfect witness.

370
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,583
Yes! I am the witness. On duty.

371
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Give me a drink,
and the body regains its balance.

372
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
And I'll make a steady statement.

373
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,666
Yes!

374
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,458
How can this drunkard be a witness?

375
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you have any common sense?

376
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,625
Why would we be working for you if we did?

377
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,750
This witness…

378
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,250
- Where is he?
- The honorable judge is here!

379
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,500
Hey,

380
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,041
I think you've
become quite fair lately.

381
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:03,958
Yes, sir.

382
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,625
Why wouldn't you when you're holding
the umbrella for yourself?

383
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,250
Hold it properly!

384
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,041
- Sir…
- Good morning, sir.

385
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,333
Is your case also scheduled
for a hearing today?

386
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,708
- Yes, sir! It's my fiftieth case.
- Really?

387
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,458
- Please, sir, bless me.
- Hey!

388
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,000
So, this is your fiftieth case?

389
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,416
Half-century?

390
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,708
Lovely!

391
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,333
You're the only lawyer
to lose all your cases.

392
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,250
An unbreakable record!

393
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Yeah…

394
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,666
Stop it!

395
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,125
Don't prolong at least this case.
Close it immediately.

396
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,791
- Hey! Follow me.
- Sir?

397
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
- Juniors!
- Yes, Senior?

398
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,833
Due to your inefficiency,
I am losing my influence.

399
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,833
Do you have any?

400
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,291
How can we find a witness on the spot?

401
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,416
Madam!

402
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,250
You didn't pay me the fare.

403
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,708
It's 250 rupees.

404
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,083
Madam! Give me my money.

405
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,583
You're my first ride today.

406
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,416
I will give you, dear.
I will.

407
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,458
I will give you an incredible character.

408
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,333
I want my money.
Why are you talking about a character?

409
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,500
You must stand as a witness in court.

410
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,666
Oh, no!
Leave me out of these court matters.

411
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,958
Give me my money. I'll go my way.

412
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,625
Look at them just once.

413
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,666
If you don't stand as a witness,

414
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,458
they will lose their case.

415
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,208
Let them.
How am I concerned?

416
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,833
Give me my money.
I want to leave.

417
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,833
If they lose,

418
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,000
the family will end up on the street.

419
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,750
Unable to bear the humiliation,
he'll commit suicide.

420
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,708
Losing her husband, this poor woman

421
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,166
will find a rope
and hang herself from a tree.

422
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,625
Would you like that?
Do you have a heart?

423
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,708
Imagine the horrifying incident
that will happen.

424
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,833
It's heartbreaking even to imagine.

425
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,458
Tell me, what should I do?

426
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,250
Simple. Save this family.

427
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,916
If it's to save a family…

428
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,416
I'm ready to do anything.

429
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,625
Good!

430
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,541
What is your name, dear?

431
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,625
Shankar.

432
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,250
Do you know any acting?

433
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,208
Such things…

434
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,083
Are you familiar with stage dramas, etc.?

435
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,833
Did you receive any applause
or whistles while performing in them?

436
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,958
Such things for me…

437
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,375
No problem.

438
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,416
There's a natural ease in your body
and grace in your face.

439
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,125
I will encourage you.

440
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,500
I'll make you a big star. Watch.

441
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,458
If I try films, do you think I'll succeed?

442
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,791
No doubt. You'll rise
to heights beyond anyone's reach.

443
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,041
Act just once.

444
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,333
- You'll remain number one for decades.
- Yes!

445
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,333
Oh my!

446
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,833
Just repeat what I tell you in court.

447
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,416
I don't know Bengali.

448
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,791
Oh, my God!

449
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,208
You've just missed the chance
of becoming a star.

450
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,041
Missed it by a whisker. A whisker.

451
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:55,708
So what?

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,291
The law can't see. You can't speak.

453
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,583
What did you say your name was?

454
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,625
Hey!

455
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,750
He's a natural!

456
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,958
He fully embodied the character.

457
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,750
Very sharp.

458
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,416
You have a bright future ahead.

459
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:17,875
You're fantastic.

460
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,958
When I make this hand gesture
in the court,

461
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,250
shake your head.

462
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,375
When I move my pen like this,

463
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,166
nod your head.

464
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,750
- That's all.
- Let's rehearse.

465
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,875
Can't you see it by just looking at him?

466
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,541
He's a one-take artist!

467
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,791
Correct…

468
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,416
{\an8}TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

469
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,708
My Lord!

470
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:42,083
To establish that they have
falsely accused my innocent client,

471
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,083
Shankar, who is non-verbal,

472
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,416
- Non-verbal?
- is the witness.

473
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,666
He's surpassing Ram Charan's
performance in <i>Rangasthalam.</i>

474
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,916
- Your Honor! He is a--
- Objection, Your Honor!

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,625
{\an8}No objections, none. Sit down!

476
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,375
After reviewing all the case details

477
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,625
and the evidence provided by Shankar,
who is non-verbal,

478
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:28,416
the court concludes that
the accused Ketan Agarwal is innocent.

479
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,416
Displaying exceptional presence
of mind during the argument

480
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,250
and saving an innocent man,

481
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,708
the court commends Lasya.

482
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,791
- No…
- Yes, Mahaa!

483
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:50,750
<i>Brother…</i>

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,833
Tell me, dear.

485
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,041
I'm out for some work.

486
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,125
<i>Brother, my class is over.</i>
<i>Shall I take the tram?</i>

487
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,625
No, dear. Stay right there.

488
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,458
- I'll come to pick you up.
<i>- Okay, Brother.</i>

489
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,125
Okay, dear.

490
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,541
Continue, dear. Why did you stop?

491
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,666
Go on.
After all, you are non-verbal.

492
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,958
Dear, is it just speaking?
Or do you also sing?

493
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,958
Let me know if you can sing.

494
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,291
Let's shift from the courtroom
to a movie set.

495
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,958
Lasya, you and I can dance.

496
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,541
Look at that head shake!

497
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,583
Sorry…

498
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,958
- Shut up!
- Sorry! I…

499
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,750
- How dare you deceive the court!
- Please!

500
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,625
Using your 50th case as an excuse,
you attempted to trick me!

501
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,583
- Please…
- For three long years…

502
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,333
you are suspended!

503
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:43,791
- Brother…
- Greetings, brother.

504
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,875
{\an8}Brother Shankar!

505
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,583
{\an8}Today is Durga Puja in the colony.

506
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,791
{\an8}Mahaa is doing it.
You must join us.

507
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,666
{\an8}- You must sing and dance!
<i>- Move your body, oh, move it</i>

508
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,041
<i>Move your body, oh, move it</i>

509
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,708
<i>Move it, move it, move it, and dance</i>
<i>Oh, Mister Gentleman! Move and dance!</i>

510
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:05,458
<i>Move it, move it, move it, and dance</i>
<i>Oh, Mister Gentleman! Move and dance!</i>

511
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:16,875
<i>Have fun and enjoy your life</i>

512
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:24,083
<i>Embrace it, my friend, wherever you reside</i>

513
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:28,000
<i>Be happy always before bidding farewell</i>

514
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:35,166
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no bounds</i>

515
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:42,583
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no boundaries</i>

516
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,041
<i>Have fun and enjoy your life</i>

517
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:16,125
<i>Though your eyes might be black and white</i>

518
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:20,125
<i>Paint your dreams</i>
<i>With vibrant hues, my dear</i>

519
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:27,166
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no boundaries</i>

520
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:34,583
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no boundaries</i>

521
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:08,541
<i>Life is a safari of lions</i>
<i>And you're the hunter</i>

522
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,625
<i>Leap forth and ride on</i>

523
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,958
<i>The path you tread</i>
<i>Is marked by speed bumps</i>

524
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,000
<i>But smile</i>
<i>For you're the Ferrari speeding ahead</i>

525
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,833
<i>- Hey, step into the chariot of bliss</i>
<i>- A chariot of bliss</i>

526
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:26,583
<i>- And take a celebratory procession around</i>
<i>- A celebratory procession around</i>

527
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:30,291
<i>Life is a colorful Holi</i>
<i>And each moment a Diwali</i>

528
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,541
<i>Be ignited with a blazing fire</i>

529
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:41,541
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no boundaries</i>

530
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:49,000
<i>Beat the drums with force</i>
<i>Let joy know no boundaries</i>

531
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,875
<i>Have fun and enjoy your life</i>

532
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:04,208
{\an8}<i>Have fun and enjoy your life</i>

533
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,125
Taxi!

534
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,208
- Sir…
- Yeah!

535
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,208
Thank you!

536
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,166
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, Mahaa?

537
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,333
Brother, my classes are finished.

538
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,750
Are you coming to pick me up?

539
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,666
Actually…

540
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,625
I have a passenger in the car.

541
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,916
Should I take a tram then?

542
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,625
Do you speak Telugu?

543
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,625
- Yes, sir.
- Oh!

544
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,583
My sister is studying at a college nearby.

545
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:52,083
- If you don't mind, can I…
- Sure.

546
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,083
Thank you, sir!

547
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,291
Dear, I'll come to pick you up.

548
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,708
- Stay right there.
- Okay.

549
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,833
Thank you, sir.

550
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,833
Sir, you came from abroad.
What do you do?

551
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,208
- I'm a pilot in Dubai.
- Oh!

552
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,250
Oh, so you're also a driver like me.

553
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,083
Once you take off,
you can travel far in the air.

554
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:17,208
No traffic, signals,
or speed breakers like us.

555
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,625
Brother!

556
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Hurry up, dear.

557
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:44,833
One minute…

558
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,500
Sir! This is my sister, Maha Lakshmi.

559
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,750
Hi! Shrikar.

560
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:08,958
Hi!

561
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:09,916
Brother!

562
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,250
I made this for quick drawing.

563
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,541
It's been chosen for the competition!

564
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,791
It's really good.

565
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,875
Are you an artist?

566
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,083
A great artist, as you can see.

567
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,541
Look at this one.

568
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,375
Beautiful!

569
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:26,958
Thank you!

570
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,416
It's fantastic!

571
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,083
Thank you!

572
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,583
Dear, he forgot this.
Give it to him.

573
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,750
Excuse me!

574
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,458
You forgot your bag.

575
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,666
Thanks.

576
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,458
You're welcome.

577
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,166
Shrikar!

578
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,291
Hi, Mom!

579
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,125
How are you?

580
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,583
We've shortlisted four matches for you.

581
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,166
Simply choose one from them.

582
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,625
We're planning a grand wedding in a month.

583
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:14,916
I've already made my choice.

584
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,750
- Your choice is our choice.
- That's right, Dad!

585
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,000
Mom?

586
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,291
How come your daughter's lawyer gown
is hanging on the wall?

587
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,583
Hit him!

588
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:32,333
That driver has taken
my most cherished lawyer's coat.

589
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,625
Suspended?

590
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,750
There's something fishy about him.

591
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,166
- I'll uncover it. I will!
- You won't do it.

592
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,083
Keep hitting.

593
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,625
Wow! What fantastic news you bring
as soon as I arrive!

594
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,958
{\an8}Hey, Senior looks better as a bouncer
than a lawyer.

595
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,000
{\an8}Bubbly Bouncer.

596
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,541
Good to see you,
my jobless and useless sister!

597
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,958
Lately, brainless too.

598
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,333
- Quite obvious.
- Shut up!

599
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,583
Please, don't disturb her.
Ma'am is in revenge mode.

600
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,500
When she sees a yellow car,

601
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,166
she gets frustrated,
as if she has caught yellow fever.

602
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,708
Hey! I got you a watch as a gift.

603
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,250
Wear this. Your time will turn good.

604
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,000
Are you trying to insult me
by calling my time bad?

605
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,541
- Hey!
- Bad time!

606
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,708
- These two are also suspended, right?
- Hey, Shrikar! Stop!

607
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,333
How could you break
such a valuable watch?

608
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,375
- Mom, look at her. Dad, stop her.
- Wait.

609
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,291
- Hey, wait!
- You deserved the suspension.

610
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,958
Ever since childhood,
you've been my true enemy.

611
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,625
- Me?
- Yes! You're my bad luck!

612
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,416
You're the embodiment of bad luck!

613
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
They have great self-awareness.

614
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,250
I will show him.

615
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,208
I'll show the taxi driver what I am.

616
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:31,958
Please…

617
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:39,916
Good evening, everyone.

618
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,666
There's a significant reason
for gathering all the taxi drivers

619
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,708
and rickshaw drivers of the city here.

620
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:52,708
Women trafficking, extortion, kidnapping,
and drug-related activities in Kolkata

621
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,500
have escalated
to become the top concern in Asia.

622
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,625
This operation is masterminded
by an international mafia.

623
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,875
These three individuals
are the linchpins of this operation.

624
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,666
Meet Bretlee,
the youngest sibling among them.

625
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,625
His role involves selecting,
abducting, and trafficking girls.

626
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,166
Next is Charles, the second brother,

627
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:10,291
responsible for transporting
these kidnapped girls

628
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,375
from India to foreign nations.

629
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,666
Lastly, we have Alexander,
the head of the gang.

630
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,875
His whereabouts are shrouded in mystery,
emerging only when necessary.

631
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,250
His purview includes trading
and international dealings.

632
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,333
They are all notorious mafia.

633
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,833
I have identified 20 individuals
with links to this operation.

634
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,250
While our police force
can't cover the entire city,

635
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,791
you, as drivers,
are like CCTV cameras on the move.

636
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:33,875
If you spot any of these individuals,
call me immediately on my direct line.

637
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:37,333
Your information will remain confidential,

638
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:40,666
and you will also receive
a monetary reward for your assistance.

639
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:41,958
Sir!

640
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,875
When we're doing something good,
do we really need money and rewards?

641
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:52,625
The moment we spot them,
you'll be informed promptly.

642
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,083
I appreciate you.

643
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,125
- Why should we get involved?
- Police department…

644
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,333
Don't object.

645
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,291
Young girls are being kidnapped daily.

646
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:05,000
There are more missing person posters
in this city than movie posters.

647
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,625
Hello! It's the mafia.

648
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,208
Very dangerous criminals.

649
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,125
Do we really need
to do social service now?

650
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,500
Brother, no matter what you say,

651
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,916
I don't hesitate
when someone needs my help.

652
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,166
Who are they, brother?
Why have they stopped us?

653
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,250
Should I get out?

654
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,041
No need, brother.
Your picture is enough.

655
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,000
They should tremble.

656
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,625
Okay. Come quickly.

657
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,958
Oh, it's lawyer madam.

658
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:56,250
Were you chasing me to give me change?

659
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:57,875
What a transformation in you!

660
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,000
You could've used Google Pay
to send me the money!

661
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,500
Look…
How innocent he pretends to be!

662
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:04,000
I have lost my career because of you.

663
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,916
I am not here to give you money,

664
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,416
but to see your end!

665
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,291
What did I do, madam?

666
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,375
Wow! What a performance!

667
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,916
It's because of your acting that I'm out
here on the road instead of the court.

668
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,041
{\an8}I am going to kill you.

669
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,500
{\an8}You can't do anything to me.

670
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:19,833
Look at this.

671
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,000
Look at my elder brother!

672
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,541
Who's this guy?
He looks like a monkey in glasses!

673
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,833
- Elder brother!
- Younger brother!

674
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,750
See, brother.
These guys are threatening me!

675
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,125
- Hey…
- Hey!

676
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,041
If you want to save your life
and have any desire to live,

677
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,041
hand him over and leave.

678
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,083
No way!

679
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,750
Look at how rough my brother's hand is,
like a handsaw.

680
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,125
He will rough you up.

681
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,833
Go ahead, touch him.
It'll cut right through.

682
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,708
To touch my younger brother,

683
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,916
you'll have to get past me first.

684
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,625
Who do you think he is?

685
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,750
You think he's just a taxi driver
in my company?

686
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,791
No, no, no!

687
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,625
He's my younger brother!

688
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,083
- Elder brother!
- Younger brother!

689
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,541
- Big brother!
- Younger brother!

690
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,375
- Hey!
- Hey! Bad timing!

691
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,083
One's mental, the other's sentimental.

692
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:10,208
You may need a bunch of weapons
to intimidate me.

693
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,750
Stupid kids!

694
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,166
Let me bring out my bazooka.

695
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,875
Is this a photo shoot?

696
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:23,791
That's it.

697
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,875
These photos and videos serve
as my visual evidence.

698
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,875
I'll tag judges from Sessions Court,
High Court, and Supreme Court

699
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,541
on Twitter with these images
and post them on Instagram.

700
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,000
With the hashtag…
#MilkyBeautyIsACriminal.

701
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,166
It'll go viral on social media, brother.

702
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,458
- I will see your end.
- Come on. Let's see.

703
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,833
Come on. Let's see.

704
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,208
- I won't spare you.
- Do whatever you want.

705
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,625
- Get lost, joker!
- Get out from my motherland!

706
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,416
Get out from his motherland!

707
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,958
- I am Lasya!
- Hey, go away!

708
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,875
Brother!

709
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,333
She's threatening us.

710
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,875
Do you think she'll really do it?

711
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,041
Don't worry, my younger brother.

712
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,208
Your elder brother is your savior.

713
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,916
As long as I'm here,
no harm will come to you in the city.

714
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,083
I won't allow it.

715
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,041
Thank you, brother.

716
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,833
Oh, no. It will cut me.

717
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,791
But brother…

718
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,625
I'll do something that you'll remember
for a lifetime, and thus repay you.

719
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,416
What is your name?

720
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,541
Maha Lakshmi.

721
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,500
- And yours?
- Shrikar.

722
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:42,666
What now?

723
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:43,791
You came to my college.

724
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,041
You came to my colony.

725
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,166
And now, even to the temple!

726
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,000
Hey! I thought it was just me.

727
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:52,250
So, you've been following me too, right?

728
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,333
What?

729
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,458
I mean, you saw me, right?

730
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,708
I thought pilots fly in the air,

731
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,250
not roam the streets.

732
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,750
Roam the streets?!
Do you know how hard I work?

733
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,333
Why don't you pay me
a little attention, Mahaa?

734
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,375
Mahaa!

735
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,583
Miss Maha Lakshmi!

736
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,583
I want to talk to you.

737
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,833
Can't you wait for a while?

738
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:13,791
Mahaa!

739
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,125
What is this, sir?

740
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,916
You're educated.

741
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,791
You have a great job.

742
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,333
Don't you know it's wrong
to chase after girls?

743
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, please don't mistake me
for an eve-teaser.

744
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,333
My mother is a doctor…

745
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,000
and my father is a realtor.

746
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,708
I also have a sister.

747
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,333
I came to India to get married,

748
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,958
but when I saw your sister,

749
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,708
I gave up all thoughts of matchmaking.

750
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,500
I really like Mahaa.

751
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,083
I liked her at first sight.

752
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,000
Did you tell Mahaa this?

753
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,500
I mean, that's…

754
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,208
yet…

755
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,208
If you truly like her,
confess to her boldly.

756
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:04,250
Whether a girl accepts or rejects,
respect her decision.

757
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,416
This is a major breakthrough
for Kolkata Police.

758
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,583
{\an8}<i>For the first time, we've tracked down the</i>
<i>criminals involved in women trafficking.</i>

759
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,666
<i>We've eliminated four gangsters.</i>

760
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,750
{\an8}<i>Three abducted girls have been rescued.</i>

761
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,958
<i>How did the department manage this, sir?</i>

762
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:24,333
Thanks to the right person
with the right information.

763
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,791
<i>Who provided the information, sir?</i>

764
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,958
One among you. A common man.

765
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,000
{\an8}If every citizen takes
on the same level of responsibility,

766
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,583
{\an8}we can eliminate
these criminals in no time.

767
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,750
Fine.

768
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,166
- Sir…
- Sir! Sir…

769
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,166
- Hey, Chotu!
<i>- Brother?</i>

770
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,333
Who's the informer?

771
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,208
Big Brother is furious.

772
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:47,083
- I'm coming to Kolkata tomorrow.
- There is no need.

773
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,125
I'll handle it.

774
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,250
Our undercover police team is
on the job of identifying the informer.

775
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,750
Within 48 hours,

776
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,416
I want to hear news
of the informer's demise.

777
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,416
Sure.

778
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:05,041
<i>Come on, come on</i>
<i>I am your love!</i>

779
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:08,833
Oh, no!

780
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:09,958
Bamsi!

781
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,625
Baby!

782
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:13,708
Where are you?

783
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,916
Shall we go for dinner?

784
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,916
Oh, sorry, baby.

785
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,250
I have a business meeting, dear.

786
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,083
- Is my dad accompanying you?
- No!

787
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,916
I'm going in your favorite brother's car.

788
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,041
- Here.
- Namaste, sister.

789
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,166
Brother, please take care of Bamsi.

790
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,250
{\an8}Hey, watch where you're going!
Be careful, brother!

791
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,000
Don't forget to eat, baby.

792
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,166
You forget everything when you're at work.

793
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,583
Have your dinner
and get to bed early, baby. I'll be late.

794
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,500
Missing you, baby.
Love you!

795
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,458
Bye, baby!

796
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,875
My mood is completely spoiled!

797
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:40,791
Brother!

798
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,666
Why don't you take your wife
out for dinner with you?

799
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,666
Her mouse-like face irritates me.

800
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,708
Hey, stop!

801
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,500
- I have an important meeting.
- Brother…

802
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,708
- What do you want me to do?
- Park the car and come.

803
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,708
- Brother!
- Hey, younger brother!

804
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,625
Look at you, dressed up and dancing!

805
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,416
This is a private party.

806
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:10,833
Want to have fun?

807
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,583
We have got fun.

808
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:14,666
Want love?

809
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,333
We have got love.

810
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,458
Want romance?

811
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,541
We have got romance.

812
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,708
Look here!
That's the point.

813
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,208
I can't believe this, brother.

814
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,583
You better believe it, brother.

815
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:31,500
Behind every husband who pampers his wife,
there's a hidden affair.

816
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,166
Don't be shocked! And by the way,

817
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,291
my "mouse" calls me every five minutes.
Handle her.

818
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,500
Juice, my friend.

819
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,166
Come on!

820
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,000
Let's go, baby.
Come on.

821
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,541
Twist and turn.

822
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,125
Twist and turn.

823
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,083
Twist…

824
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,333
Twist…

825
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,375
Hey!

826
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,291
Is this a hip or a hippopotamus?

827
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,875
Why do you look like my mouse-like wife?

828
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,125
Because I am high!

829
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,583
You keep saying you're "busy".
Is this your business?!

830
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,041
Bamsi!

831
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,458
If you mess with me, you'll be…

832
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,458
<i>Want fun?</i>

833
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>We have got fun!</i>

834
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:10,000
<i>We have got fun!</i>

835
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,291
<i>Want love?</i>

836
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:12,583
<i>We have got love!</i>

837
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,958
<i>We have got love!</i>

838
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,500
<i>Want romance?</i>

839
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,833
- Oh, God!
- How dare you cheat my daughter!

840
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:19,791
Cheater!

841
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:20,916
Dad!

842
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,875
Until now, I have only shown
my <i>bhalobashi</i> side to Bamsi.

843
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,083
She means love, right?

844
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,208
Yes, loser!

845
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,791
I will show him the outcome

846
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,875
when I reveal my other side!

847
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,250
<i>We have got fun!</i>

848
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,750
<i>Want love?</i>
<i>We have got love!</i>

849
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:36,791
Brother!

850
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,250
Are you in pain?

851
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,750
If not pain,

852
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,291
do you expect me to feel pleasure?

853
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:43,791
Give me a hand.

854
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,458
No, brother. It's a handsaw.
It will cut through me.

855
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:49,125
No handsaw, no crowbar.
Stop joking.

856
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,500
How did the house mice
get here all of a sudden?

857
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,416
- It was me, brother.
- You?

858
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,541
She was worried about you.
So, I went live.

859
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,458
- Bamsi!
- Live? Is this the IPL?

860
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,000
She called me her brother
with all her heart.

861
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:02,916
So?

862
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,375
Which brother would tolerate
his sister being mistreated, brother?

863
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,166
If she calls you her brother,
you'll dig me a grave?

864
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,208
Not like that…

865
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,833
- Hey, sister…
- Again?!

866
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,291
My sister.

867
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,125
<i>Hello? Brother, where are you?</i>

868
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,750
I am on my way, dear.
I am done here.

869
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,500
Not you. I am done.

870
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,166
The informer was a taxi driver.

871
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,291
He is standing opposite Prinsep Ghat.

872
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,250
Bring me the guy.

873
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:17,208
When someone rats on us,

874
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,291
the entire city of Kolkata must witness

875
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,333
how horrible the death would be.

876
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:26,666
Hang a board saying
"Police Informer" on his neck

877
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,500
and suspend his dead body
from Howrah Bridge.

878
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,416
Sure, brother.
You enjoy.

879
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,125
We will finish the job.

880
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:48,333
Weren't you dead?

881
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,083
How did you get here?

882
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,666
Hey! Kill him!

883
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,166
Hey!

884
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,416
Hey! Who are you?

885
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,041
You are not a driver.

886
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,375
Who are you? CBI?

887
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:00,750
Interpol?

888
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,083
Undercover cop?

889
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,958
Undercover killer!

890
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,000
Who has sent you?

891
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,083
Yes, Mahaa! Tell me, dear.

892
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:54,458
Brother, where are you?

893
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:55,666
It's midnight.

894
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Why aren't you home?

895
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,458
Are you still on duty?

896
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:01,666
A VIP passenger
has kept me waiting, dear.

897
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,625
Send him quickly, brother.

898
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,333
It's already late.

899
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:08,791
{\an8}Now that you have told me,
I will send him right away.

900
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,041
Who has sent you?

901
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,458
I don't get sent, idiot!

902
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,875
I have come looking for you.

903
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm not going to spare you,

904
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,375
or the one above you,
or the one above him!

905
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:54,625
ABHIDHYA PALACE

906
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,166
I haven't seen
such a brutal murder in my life.

907
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,250
The footprints of 33 people, including
your brother's, have been matched.

908
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,416
Only one footprint isn't matching.

909
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,750
He must be the killer.

910
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:42,958
Damn it!

911
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,416
Yes, Brother.

912
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,375
Where is Chotu?

913
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,208
He is not answering my call.

914
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,375
He is resting.

915
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,208
He's not feeling well.

916
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,208
He's going overboard with the powder.

917
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:01,791
Ask him to reduce it.

918
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,125
I will take care of him.

919
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,625
Who was the guy?

920
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,541
Who has done this?!

921
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:21,625
He destroyed the ship's CCTV footage,

922
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:24,250
hard disk, servers, and everything.

923
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,750
Just one guy walked in
and killed all your men.

924
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:30,416
How can he kill 33 people at a time?!

925
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,000
Could it be the doing of the rival gang?

926
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,000
No!

927
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,666
They don't have the guts!

928
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,375
So, could it be a contract killer?

929
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,916
No.

930
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,708
The killer didn't plan this.

931
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:52,666
He killed them with vengeance.

932
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,041
He killed them with rancor!

933
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:01,250
He's a cut-throat cruel guy!

934
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,125
That is where he hanged your brother.

935
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:13,916
No evidence.

936
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,458
No CCTV.

937
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:16,458
Who is the killer?!

938
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,416
If my gut feeling is right,
I am his next target.

939
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,916
Only after I kill him,

940
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:26,250
I will inform my big brother
of Chotu's death.

941
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,250
When did the cruise ship reach here?

942
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,333
A week ago.

943
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:40,958
One of them must have definitely
captured the murder on this ship.

944
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,875
I want that footage!

945
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,625
There! Brother Shankar is here.

946
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,000
Brother…

947
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:49,541
they are…

948
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,166
We are Shrikar's parents.

949
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,375
Oh! Namaste.

950
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,000
Please sit.

951
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,708
Their son likes Mahaa.

952
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,458
They have come
to discuss a potential alliance.

953
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,666
My son feels Mahaa came into his life
because of your taxi ride.

954
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,250
We also like Maha Lakshmi in every way.

955
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:14,083
We have come to request your sister's hand
in marriage for our son.

956
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,958
Actually… she is still studying.

957
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,083
Wedding right now…

958
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:22,958
She is going to college as your sister.

959
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:26,416
After the wedding, she will go to college
as our daughter-in-law. That's all.

960
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:27,541
I'm fine with that.

961
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:31,083
But my sister's opinion
is very important to me.

962
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,791
Oh, that's my son.

963
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:34,583
To know the result.

964
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,208
Dad!

965
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,583
I am talking to him.
Stay online.

966
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:40,666
He is nervous.

967
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,208
Dear, do you like my son?

968
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,208
My brother's opinion is my opinion.

969
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,666
My sister's opinion is my opinion.

970
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,250
This is not going to be resolved now.

971
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:54,916
One of you needs to speak up, Shankar.

972
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,458
Both of them are in favor.

973
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,541
That's good!

974
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,125
Let's fix an auspicious hour
and plan the engagement.

975
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,583
My love is a success!

976
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,625
Sister! My love story is a success!

977
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:07,958
It's time to party!

978
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,500
Hey!

979
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,500
Your love is a success,

980
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,416
but my career is destroyed!

981
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,708
Here's the CCTV footage.

982
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:31,666
Stop!

983
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:33,041
Zoom in.

984
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:34,583
Rewind.

985
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,208
Stop!

986
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,125
Play.

987
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,000
We got a clue.

988
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,791
The killer received a phone call
at 12:15 a.m.

989
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,666
He spoke for almost a minute.

990
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:53,125
If we trace the call to the cell tower
in that area at that specific time,

991
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,041
we can catch him.

992
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Thank you, sir.
For giving your consent.

993
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,625
Who can change destiny?

994
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,125
Come in, please.

995
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,625
My life is ruined.

996
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,583
- Namaste, sir.
- Namaste, sir.

997
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,666
<i>Are they greeting me or him?</i>

998
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,125
Stay right here and clean the car!

999
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,250
Don't come inside during the function.

1000
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:29,291
Don't!

1001
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,875
- What about food?
- Hey, eat somewhere.

1002
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:33,666
Drat!

1003
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,375
- Mr. Bamsi!
- Bamsi…

1004
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:38,625
- Mr. Bamsi!
- Hey, get lost!

1005
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,250
It's not Bamsi. It's Vamsi.

1006
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,916
Great choice.

1007
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,666
- Hi!
- Hello!

1008
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,416
You are so beautiful.

1009
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:58,583
Thank you.

1010
00:58:58,791 --> 00:58:59,708
I am Lasya.

1011
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:01,791
I can be your half-husband.

1012
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:03,166
Sure.

1013
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,875
Don't try to exert your "sister-in-law"
authority over my daughter-in-law.

1014
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,416
- Okay?
- Oh, well.

1015
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,916
Usually, girls experience pressure
from their in-laws,

1016
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,541
but I'm dealing with pressure
from my maternal home!

1017
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,375
I can't tolerate him for even a minute.

1018
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:19,833
He is my biggest enemy.

1019
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,708
Let me know if you don't get along
after the wedding.

1020
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,958
I am a popular lawyer.

1021
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,750
I can get you a divorce in no time.

1022
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,791
What's wrong with you?
We're in the middle of her engagement.

1023
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:30,916
Why are you talking about divorce?

1024
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,750
Why did you raise her like this, Dad?

1025
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,416
It's a good thing you said that now.

1026
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,583
Don't try it in front of her brother.
That's it.

1027
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,708
Why is there so much talk
about your brother?

1028
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,500
I hear more about your brother than you.

1029
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:44,500
But where is your brother?

1030
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,750
He's your brother-in-law by relation.

1031
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,208
Fine.

1032
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,875
Where is my brother-in-law?

1033
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,000
It's time for the auspicious moment.
Call Mr. Shankar.

1034
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,458
I will call my brother-in-law.

1035
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,875
- Mr. Brother-in-law! Mr. Brother-in-law!
- Over there in green kurta.

1036
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,458
- Brother! Engagement rings, brother.
- Got them. Let me see.

1037
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,500
Mr. Brother-in-law!

1038
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:10,791
You?

1039
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:11,916
It's you?

1040
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,250
You could have used Google Pay to pay me.

1041
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:15,916
You didn't have to fall in my arms.

1042
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:18,791
What are you doing here?
I have a family function going on here.

1043
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,333
I also have a family function happening.

1044
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,583
It's my brother's engagement.

1045
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,166
My sister's engagement too.

1046
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,625
Maha Lakshmi?

1047
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,000
Shrikar?

1048
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,875
So?

1049
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,291
Stop it! Stop it!

1050
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,750
This engagement isn't going to happen.

1051
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:42,916
What's wrong, dear? What's happened?

1052
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
He is the one responsible
for my suspension.

1053
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,500
- You mean…
- Brother…

1054
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,875
- I can't see, brother.
- The non-verbal witness?

1055
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,916
Taxi driver?

1056
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,625
Look at that face!
So innocent!

1057
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,583
Acting.
All an act.

1058
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:56,833
A big actor.

1059
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,458
But how can we have
an alliance with my enemy?

1060
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,708
No! Go.

1061
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:01,791
Tell them you don't want it.

1062
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,958
Master!

1063
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:07,041
Without even knowing who we are,
you've helped our family a lot.

1064
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:08,166
- Thank you.
- Brother!

1065
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,916
The first ride you talked about…

1066
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,291
Okay. It's getting late
for the engagement. Exchange your rings.

1067
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,833
Ignore her. Please come.

1068
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:18,541
Mahaa…

1069
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,000
Everyone has united against me.

1070
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,083
Come on, Senior!

1071
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,958
I think humiliation
is in your horoscope every day.

1072
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,041
So, partner!

1073
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,458
He went to court with you
and killed your career.

1074
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:30,958
He's entered this event
and separated you from your family.

1075
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,125
Now, when it comes to me,
it's even worse.

1076
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:34,583
Don't leave him.

1077
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:35,750
Think wildly.

1078
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:36,916
Do it boldly.

1079
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:53,666
Until now,

1080
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,083
- you've only seen the lawyer in Lasya.
- Yes!

1081
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:58,708
From now on,
I'll show you the criminal in me.

1082
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:02,791
Brother, I think one of them
has killed Brother Chota.

1083
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:19,958
Hey, Mahaa!

1084
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,000
Would you like to go for lunch?

1085
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,208
Should I call my brother?

1086
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:23,750
Hello!

1087
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:25,666
- Hi!
- Hello, love birds!

1088
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,958
Brother…
why is it always about your brother?

1089
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:33,125
Why don't you forget him just for once?
Forget us and enjoy the ferry.

1090
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,083
I have booked this for you.

1091
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,541
How do you have so much positivity?

1092
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,916
Go on. Take a ride!

1093
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,958
Go! Enjoy!

1094
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,083
- Thank you.
- Sister, thank you!

1095
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,958
What, Senior?
You're personally seeing them off!

1096
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,625
Shankar made me a driver.

1097
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:54,000
He made you a broker.

1098
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,500
Hey! What next?
Honeymoon, kids…

1099
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,875
- Christening, weaning ceremony…
- Schools, colleges…

1100
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:00,666
What a productive plan!

1101
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,791
I didn't send them to have fun.

1102
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,083
- Then?
- Means?

1103
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:06,500
Oh!

1104
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,583
{\an8}To take revenge.

1105
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:11,750
Lasya?

1106
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,708
Brother-in-law!

1107
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,833
Someone has kidnapped your sister.

1108
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,916
{\an8}<i>- Someone is abducting her.</i>
- What did you say?!

1109
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,291
They are wearing masks!

1110
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,375
- They're putting her in a van!
- In a van!

1111
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,666
Oh my! We don't know
where your sister's been taken.

1112
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,166
Where could she have gone?

1113
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,916
She is right in front of me!
I can see her.

1114
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,958
Where?

1115
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,625
- Near Howrah Bridge.
- I am coming.

1116
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,791
Millennium Park!
If you come to Millennium Park,

1117
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,958
we can catch them there.

1118
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,250
Can you come quickly?
Please, hurry.

1119
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,041
- I'm on my way.
- Please, hurry!

1120
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,583
<i>And save Mahaa, please!</i>

1121
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:42,708
Mahaa might go missing.

1122
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:44,291
{\an8}<i>Don't delay. Please!</i>

1123
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,708
Lasya!

1124
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:49,333
Who took her?
Did you see them?

1125
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,958
{\an8}- I did.
- Which way? What was the number?

1126
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,916
{\an8}- Which way did they go?
- They kidnapped her here.

1127
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:54,916
They put her in the van right here.

1128
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,875
- Which way?
- They must have gone this way.

1129
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,875
Brother!

1130
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,833
Brother, I was just about to call you.

1131
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,666
My sister…

1132
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:04,916
over there.

1133
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:08,333
See? Were you panicking
because your sister was kidnapped?

1134
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,000
Did your heart stop?

1135
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,375
This…
This is what I wanted.

1136
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,958
Mess with Lasya,
and this is what you get.

1137
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,083
This is only the beginning.

1138
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,791
- You'll see more in the future.
- Shut up!

1139
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,208
My sister means everything to me.

1140
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:43,625
I can't imagine my life without her.

1141
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:45,791
If something happens to her…

1142
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:47,791
I…

1143
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:50,708
Don't ever play such pranks.

1144
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,625
- Shankar!
- Enough!

1145
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,125
What? I think the plan has backfired.

1146
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,666
The scene is set.

1147
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:24,458
<i>A genuine Telugu green pepper macho man</i>
<i>A handsome hunk, incredibly hot and spicy</i>

1148
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:27,083
<i>Invading my dreams</i>
<i>And stirring my maiden heart</i>

1149
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,583
<i>He asks</i>
<i>Girl, what is the matter?</i>

1150
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:33,875
<i>A sweet-looking, delicate darling</i>

1151
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:44,000
<i>Your glamour makes me naughty</i>

1152
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:49,125
<i>Wow, wow! Whistles of mischief</i>
<i>And it's a Eureka moment when I see you</i>

1153
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:54,250
<i>How can you be so glamorous, my beauty</i>

1154
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:59,250
<i>Turning my heart over</i>
<i>And etching your image like a tattoo</i>

1155
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:04,333
<i>You've worked magic, altering my thoughts</i>

1156
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,916
<i>Milky beauty! You are my sweetie!</i>

1157
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,541
<i>Let's you and I have a dating party</i>

1158
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:20,541
<i>Hey, you slyly stole my heart, you naughty</i>

1159
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,791
<i>Let's you and I have a dating party</i>

1160
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:02,583
{\an8}<i>You've stormed into my heart valiantly</i>

1161
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:07,541
<i>Bringing a hurricane</i>
<i>That swept me off my feet</i>

1162
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:12,875
<i>Oh, you bring along</i>
<i>Countless colorful dreams</i>

1163
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:17,916
<i>Adding my name to yours</i>

1164
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
<i>The fire in your breath</i>
<i>Is enough to elevate me</i>

1165
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:28,083
<i>Its warmth could melt</i>
<i>The European snow mountains</i>

1166
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:33,000
<i>A simple snap of your fingers</i>
<i>Can shake my youth</i>

1167
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:37,958
<i>Let the arrows of your glances</i>
<i>Gently land like butterflies</i>

1168
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:41,416
<i>Milky beauty! You are my sweetie!</i>

1169
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:49,083
<i>Let's you and I have a dating party</i>

1170
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:54,041
<i>Hey, you've stolen my heart, you naughty</i>

1171
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:59,041
<i>Let's you and I have a dating party</i>

1172
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,208
The tower has been activated.

1173
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,500
Yes! I have hacked the mobile network!

1174
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:26,583
Call Mr. Charles.

1175
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,000
We have traced
the killer's mobile network, sir.

1176
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:35,625
If he receives a call
and it lasts for three minutes,

1177
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:37,041
we can lock his exact location.

1178
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,125
Let's do it!

1179
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,083
This is boring, Mahaa.

1180
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,208
Let's do some ladies' shopping.
When are you going shopping?

1181
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,250
My brother knows what I want.
He'll shop for me.

1182
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,333
We want to go shopping too. Call him up.

1183
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,458
Okay.

1184
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:56,833
Sir! Call activated.

1185
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:57,875
Come on!

1186
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,875
Come on! Answer the call!

1187
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Sir, the call is connected.

1188
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:12,541
Brother!

1189
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:13,916
Where are you?

1190
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,458
Brother-in-law!

1191
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,458
Even my sister-in-law needs to shop.

1192
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:22,250
Tell us your location.
I'll join you… for shopping.

1193
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,791
Can you share your live location?

1194
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:25,833
Over there.

1195
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,375
Hey! How much time?

1196
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,041
The call needs to continue
for two more minutes, sir.

1197
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,416
We can lock the location.

1198
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,666
I am dying to kill you.

1199
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:43,666
Dying to kill you.

1200
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,583
One more minute, sir.

1201
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,083
Thirty more seconds, sir.

1202
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:02,000
- We got it, sir.
- Hey, lock the GPS.

1203
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:06,833
GPS locked, sir.

1204
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,125
- Send the location to everyone.
- Okay, sir!

1205
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,500
Bring that person to me.

1206
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,041
Where is he now?

1207
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:29,958
Sir!

1208
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,666
He is in our own area, sir.

1209
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:33,708
What?!

1210
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,000
He's approaching our building, sir.

1211
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,000
He's in our elevator, sir!

1212
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,250
Guys!

1213
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,583
Let's catch him!

1214
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,708
We thought we were hunting,

1215
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:24,041
but he's coming to hunt us.

1216
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,000
Where is he?!

1217
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:47,958
Lock the door!

1218
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,166
Kill him!

1219
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,833
Tell me, Alexander.

1220
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,416
Who the hell are you?

1221
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,375
Listen!

1222
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:59,666
I hold as much importance in your life
as your parents do.

1223
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,000
What on earth
are you talking about?

1224
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:02,333
With one slight difference.

1225
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,708
You were brought into this world by them.

1226
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:07,666
You'll leave this world because of me.

1227
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,666
Who are you?

1228
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:14,375
Can you hear the cries
of your guy's death?

1229
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:18,375
Bretley's death is my visiting card.

1230
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,583
This guy's death is my invitation card.

1231
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:29,291
For you, your gang, your network,

1232
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:33,500
and your entire mafia, I am the one
who will present the end card!

1233
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:59,500
You terrify me when I look at you.

1234
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:02,875
You are a murderer.

1235
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,125
A brutal killer.

1236
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:08,125
You killed them all!

1237
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,125
Yes!

1238
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,458
I killed them all!

1239
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:12,625
Not just them.

1240
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,625
I've taken lives in the past,

1241
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,166
and I'll kill more people in the future.

1242
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:20,791
I won't let my brother
marry the sister of a killer!

1243
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,541
If that's your only objection…

1244
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:27,416
I'll have you know
she isn't even my sister!

1245
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,041
She's not your sister?

1246
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:33,166
That's true! Mahaa isn't my sister!

1247
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:09,000
Brother Bhola!

1248
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,125
Brother Bhola!

1249
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,291
- Brother Bhola!
- Hey, what happened, bro?

1250
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,416
What are all these bruises?
Has someone hit you?

1251
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,041
You know a new SI has taken charge, right?

1252
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:19,916
He acted too clever and raided
Jitthu's cricket betting den, brother.

1253
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,750
<i>Jitthu is thrashing</i>
<i>all my friends, brother.</i>

1254
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,333
<i>I have somehow escaped, brother.</i>

1255
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:25,375
Brother, please call Brother Bhola.
Please!

1256
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,750
{\an8}When the public has a problem,
they run to the cops.

1257
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,291
{\an8}- But when the cops have a problem?
- They run to Brother Bhola.

1258
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,375
<i>This is my world</i>

1259
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:36,083

1260
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,166

<i>What's your job here?</i>

1262
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:44,291
<i>This is my world, my home, my abode…</i>

1263
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,666
Hey! Who changed the song?

1264
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,791
If you change the song, he will
pull out your nerves and play the Veena.

1265
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:50,791
That's right!

1266
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:55,458
<i>When met with paths of thorns</i>
<i>We spread buds on them</i>

1267
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,041
Brother, please be kind.
I beg you. Please. Call him.

1268
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,791
Do you think he is God to grant boons
as soon as you bow to him?

1269
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,875
I have two lakhs recovered in the raid.

1270
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,916
Please take it, brother.

1271
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,833
- Please call Brother Bhola.
- Hey, check.

1272
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:07,375
{\an8}- Brother Bhola!
- This is fine.

1273
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:08,666
{\an8}But who is going to pay the BST?

1274
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:10,625
B? Isn't it GST?

1275
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:11,958
- Hey, it's BST!
- BST!

1276
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,583
Bhola Shankar Tax!

1277
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:15,208
{\an8}- Full and final settlement!
- Okay, brother.

1278
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,791
We will collect funds
and pay you, brother.

1279
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,375
Please, brother.
Call Brother Bhola.

1280
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,166
Brother Bhola!
Deal okay!

1281
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:30,583
<i>One, two, three!</i>
<i>Look, here he comes</i>

1282
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:39,666
<i>Search all through the state</i>
<i>Not one dare come face to face</i>

1283
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:48,333
<i>Blazing, raging, Bhola</i>

1284
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,291

1286
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,333
<i>Blazing, raging, Bhola</i>

1287
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,791
Brother!
What a dramatic entrance he pulled off!

1288
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,750
He stirred up a cloud of dust!

1289
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:04,791
{\an8}Oh my!

1290
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,041
Hey, Bhola!

1291
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:18,708
Why did you come here?

1292
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:23,458
To entertain you all.

1293
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:27,375
Come on! My love…

1294
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,458
{\an8}Ram Pyari.

1295
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,666
Did it hurt?

1296
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,000
It thrilled me.

1297
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,208
Hey!

1298
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:46,250
You are so romantic, brother.

1299
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,875
Hey, Bhola! What is this?

1300
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,125
This is my area.
My domain!

1301
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,041
My territory!

1302
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:55,833
<i>This is my world, my home, my abode</i>

1303

1304
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,583
<i>This is my world</i>

1305
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:05,875
<i>- My home, my abode</i>
- I am speaking, and why is he singing?

1306
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,083
{\an8}My younger brother's song.
A great one, right?

1307
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,083
{\an8}It's a killer song.

1308
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,416
Puppy!

1309
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:26,291
Puppy… I thought I'd see a little pup.

1310
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,833
How did you end up so tall,
like a chimney?

1311
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:32,750
True, brother. I doubt he could
even be reached with a ladder!

1312
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,458
- So tall!
- Hey, Puppy!

1313
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,166
Thrash them!

1314
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:54,958
<i>- Mega mass is our man</i>
<i>- Blazing, raging, Bhola</i>

1315
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:57,916
<i>- Thump, boom, bang!</i>
<i>- How was that smack?</i>

1316
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,833
<i>- He is a ball of fire</i>
<i>- Blazing, raging, Bhola</i>

1317
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:04,000

{\an8}- Hey!
- Hey!

1323
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:21,625
{\an8}He reduced your puppy to dregs.

1324
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,041
Hey, Bhola!

1325
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,500
This is my area!

1326
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,375
{\an8}One blow and your jaws will break.

1327
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:31,041
Don't talk like a fool dividing states!

1328
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,500
The state may have been divided.
But all people are mine.

1329
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:35,333
All areas are mine.

1330
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:38,375
I have no limits.
And no borders.

1331
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,791
- Hey, Bhola!
- Tell me!

1332
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:41,000
Don't come at me.

1333
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,958
I have the mafia backing me.

1334
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,708
{\an8}Hey, half-wit!

1335
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:46,166
You may have the mafia behind you.

1336
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:48,333
But I have the entire world behind me.

1337
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:51,958
If I come in,
your entry and exit will make no sense.

1338
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:53,791
{\an8}Brother is trying to say…

1339
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:56,166
your back and front will be damaged.

1340
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,208
Hey, Bhola! What are you doing?

1341
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:24,583
I am going to bend you, curve you,
tear you apart, and make you dance.

<i>Bhola!</i>

1394
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:49,875
<i>Bhola!</i>

1395
01:28:55,958 --> 01:29:01,750
<i>It's a deadly funfair</i>
<i>With one snap of my fingers</i>

1396
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:07,250
<i>It ignites a mind-blowing frenzy</i>
<i>When I dance in my style</i>

1397
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:13,333
<i>Where's the fun in being too perfect?</i>
<i>How is a little deviation a defect?</i>

1398
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:16,291
<i>Unless the heart is happy</i>
<i>How does the day go by?</i>

1399
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:18,833
<i>Who's going to halt our enjoyment?</i>

1400
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:21,708
<i>One and only very cool Bhola</i>

1401
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:22,625
<i>Come on!</i>

1402
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:24,750
<i>Bhola, Bhola, Bhola!</i>

1403
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:27,625
<i>Once I step in</i>
<i>It's a switch on for a grand show</i>

1404
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,666
<i>Bhola, Bhola, Bhola!</i>

1405
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:33,750
<i>My entry is a deadly extravaganza</i>

1406
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:46,250
<i>Hail Bhola Shankar!</i>

1407
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:52,208
<i>Bhola Shankar!</i>

1408
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,125
<i>Hail Bhola Shankar!</i>

1409
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,500
Hey, Bhola!

1410
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:17,958
How dare you send me to jail!

1411
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,791
Hey, let's go!

1412
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:27,375
Excuse me!
What happened to you?

1413
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:28,666
Hey, girl!

1414
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:31,125
- Don't get involved. Go!
- Help!

1415
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,291
- Go away from here!
- Help!

1416
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:33,541
Help! Please, help me!

1417
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,625
Hey! Brother Bhola! What happened?

1418
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:37,708
He's a notorious gangster. It's risky.

1419
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:39,458
- Get away from here. Stay away.
- Hello!

1420
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,875
Hey, Jitthu! You fought very unfairly.

1421
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,375
You're losing a lot of blood.
Someone stabbed you.

1422
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:47,166
Girl, it's not the first time
I've been backstabbed.

1423
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,583
- Go. Go away.
- Rickshaw!

1424
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:51,291
Go! Go away!

1425
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:52,291
Please help!

1426
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:56,833
Please call the doctor.

1427
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:58,125
- What happened?
- It is urgent.

1428
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,416
He was stabbed.

1429
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,833
Please call the doctor immediately.

1430
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:01,791
Stabbed?

1431
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,125
It's a police case.

1432
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,625
First, file a police complaint.
Then we'll admit him.

1433
01:31:05,958 --> 01:31:08,000
Oh my! He's losing a lot of blood.

1434
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:10,208
Any delay will cost him his life.
Please, sister, please.

1435
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:11,916
Please admit him in any way possible.

1436
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,666
What is he to you?

1437
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:15,750
He is my…

1438
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,583
brother.

1439
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:21,625
My brother.

1440
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:24,166
- Please! Start the treatment.
- Sister!

1441
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:25,583
She says he's her brother.

1442
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,125
He's losing too much blood!

1443
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,125
Take him to the emergency room!

1444
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:30,916
Thank you.

1445
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,208
Thank you so much, sister.

1446
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,916
- I will inform the doctor.
- Okay, madam.

1447
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,125
You'll be fine. We're in the hospital.

1448
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:39,833
Nothing will happen to you.

1449
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,666
Dear.

1450
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:52,541
Your brother needs O+ blood immediately.

1451
01:31:52,791 --> 01:31:54,958
I am also O+.
I'll donate mine.

1452
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:57,541
Let's go!

1453
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,625
Dear?

1454
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:19,750
You brought him just in time
and saved your brother's life.

1455
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:22,625
We've moved him to the ward.
You can visit him.

1456
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:23,833
- Thank you, sister.
- Come.

1457
01:32:33,708 --> 01:32:35,083
Your brother is out of danger now.

1458
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:36,541
He'll be discharged tomorrow.

1459
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:38,250
You were here the whole night.

1460
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,541
Go home and come back.

1461
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:03,500
Wow!

1462
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,750
{\an8}You have magic in your hands, Aunty!

1463
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:08,083
I just can't stop eating.

1464
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,250
No hurry. Eat in peace.

1465
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,750
{\an8}Once you're done,

1466
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:13,583
- I'll pack the rest and send it.
- Hey!

1467
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,208
You're taking advantage of my friendship!

1468
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:17,916
Aunty is my friend too.

1469
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:20,875
Don't eat so quickly. It won't digest.

1470
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:21,875
It's okay, Aunty!

1471
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:24,000
Enough with your eating.
It's time for college. Let's go.

1472
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:25,291
Let's go!

1473
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:34,000
If the doctor doesn't agree,
we'll show them what we can do.

1474
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,125
What, doctor?

1475
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,375
How are you?

1476
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:38,416
Greetings, sir.

1477
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:46,000
If you sign the sale agreement,
we can plan the house registration.

1478
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,541
I have already told you.

1479
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:48,500
This house…

1480
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:50,458
I am not selling the house, sir!

1481
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:56,666
Who are you?!
What's this?!

1482
01:33:57,916 --> 01:33:58,750
- Dad!
- Husband!

1483
01:33:58,833 --> 01:33:59,750
Who are they?

1484
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:00,875
We told you.

1485
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:04,375
We're building a large shopping mall here,
worth 200 crores.

1486
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,875
Your house can serve
as a perfect parking space.

1487
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,458
You'll also get money if you sell it.

1488
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:11,333
It's not about that.
This is our ancestral home.

1489
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:12,833
It's a memory of my parents.

1490
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:14,500
Comply, and you'll receive money.

1491
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,416
Otherwise,
you'll face a bulldozer one night.

1492
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:18,458
You'll lose your life
along with the house.

1493
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,625
Don't blame me later.

1494
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:22,000
Hey! The house should be ours
within a week.

1495
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:24,875
Dad!

1496
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:26,916
Let's go to the police
and file a complaint.

1497
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:29,875
It's not the police station
we should go to.

1498
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:33,083
There's a rowdy boss
who can handle rascals like them.

1499
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:41,250
A body hanging in the air means
only one thing. The rowdy boss is at work!

1500
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:46,458
Brother, piping hot masala tea.

1501
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:49,541
Thanks, man.

1502
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:50,750
This is Bhola.

1503
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:52,375
He looks dashing, doesn't he?

1504
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:53,708
Hey!

1505
01:34:53,875 --> 01:34:56,500
I told you I took someone to the hospital
and saved him by giving my blood, right?

1506
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,166
That's him.

1507
01:34:58,291 --> 01:34:59,166
Great then.

1508
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:01,375
Consider our job done for free.
Let's go and tell him.

1509
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:05,125
What kind of help is it when you announce
it to him and expect something in return?

1510
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:07,416
We're not telling him that.

1511
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,083
You're right. Come, let's talk to him.

1512
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:12,375
Wait a minute!
What's the issue?

1513
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:14,291
{\an8}That…

1514
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:15,333
{\an8}Look here.

1515
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,333
- Someone needs to be warned.
- Fifty thousand.

1516
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,625
- Okay.
- Fine.

1517
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:19,708
- Brother Bhola!
- Come!

1518
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:20,666
Did you bring money?

1519
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,375
- Boss, we have customers.
- Do we?

1520
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:24,541
Female customers, boss.

1521
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:25,666
Fine.

1522
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:30,375
- Please, come and have a seat, madam.
- Please, sit.

1523
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:32,666
- What do you need?
- Namaste.

1524
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,416
They want a murder.
Are you ready? Get lost!

1525
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:36,666
Go away.

1526
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:38,750
Nothing, sir. Actually…

1527
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,333
If there's nothing, what's the point?

1528
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,791
No, there is…

1529
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:44,416
- If there is… go ahead and speak.
- Mr. Bhola,

1530
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:47,250
some builders put up a complex
next to my house.

1531
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,875
They want our house for its parking,
and they've been threatening us.

1532
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:53,750
You must do something and save us.

1533
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:56,666
Alright. Brother gets the whole picture.
Pay some advance first.

1534
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,708
- Make the payment, madam.
- Pay it.

1535
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:03,875
I have twenty-five thousand.

1536
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:06,250
Once the job is done, the rest…

1537
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,083
Mr. Bhola!

1538
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,166
Tell me, madam!

1539
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:15,333
Is there a special discount for ladies?

1540
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:17,666
Always for ladies.

1541
01:36:19,416 --> 01:36:21,166
But not for swindlers like you.

1542
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,375
Very shiny! Keep it.

1543
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:28,541
Now it is even.

1544
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:29,875
Move along!

1545
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,958
The job will be done, right?

1546
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:33,291
- You are asking me?
- Hey! How dare you!

1547
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,958
- What do you think of him?
- It will be done. The job will be done.

1548
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:36,041
SHIVA NILAYAM
1960

1549
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:45,166
- Namaste, sir.
- Namaste.

1550
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,958
Hey, what's this?
Plants all over the house.

1551
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:49,083
Is this a house or a forest?

1552
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,708
- It's naturopathy, son.
- Meaning?

1553
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,500
- Nature-based treatment.
- Oh!

1554
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:54,083
A hospital?

1555
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,041
Then where are the medicines?

1556
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:56,458
Every plant is a medicine.

1557
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:59,416
Hey, this is a plant hospital.

1558
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:02,541
We heard hospitals for bones.
What's this plant hospital?

1559
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:05,166
All they know is eating biryani.
No brains at all. Idiots! Go!

1560
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:06,333
Let me show you around the house.

1561
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:07,958
My father practices medicine here.

1562
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Hey! Supplies!

1563
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:12,041
Hey, doctor! Let's party!

1564
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:13,416
Hey, doctor!

1565
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:14,541
What brand is this?

1566
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:16,791
It's not that kind of supply, dear.

1567
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,750
This is our medicine.

1568
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:20,041
It's herbal oil.
It's good for your health.

1569
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,333
Would you like to try a bit?

1570
01:37:21,833 --> 01:37:23,500
We have our own supplies.
Would you like to try it?

1571
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,291
- Bring out the supplies.
- Oh, God! Save us.

1572
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:26,333
Dear, please take them.

1573
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,416
Please, come.

1574
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:32,583
Hey! I can smell a great aroma.

1575
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:35,208
- Yes, brother.
- It's a non-stop party from now.

1576
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:36,666
Come!

1577
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:40,666
Hey! It smells really nice.

1578
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:42,333
Snacks and savories.
My mother is making them.

1579
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:43,625
Mom, come.

1580
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,666
{\an8}Hey, munchies for the party.

1581
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:48,625
{\an8}- Look at all these fritters.
- We can finish it all.

1582
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,166
{\an8}This is our Swamy.

1583
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:53,791
- Hey, stop right there.
- Stop!

1584
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:54,958
Don't be afraid.

1585
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,500
He doesn't bite.

1586
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,916
Hey… I wasn't scared.

1587
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,708
This guy pushed me and stepped forward.

1588
01:38:02,958 --> 01:38:04,416
Swamy! Greet them.

1589
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,541
God! Why are they here again?

1590
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:19,125
Son! Those ruffians are back.

1591
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:21,125
- Hey, come on.
- Brother!

1592
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:22,791
- Mr. Bhola!
- Yes, madam?

1593
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:23,750
That way.

1594
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,583
Any direction, I'm ready.
Come on!

1595
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:28,625
I'm going to knock their heads off!
Scoundrels!

1596
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:30,291
- Where are they?
- Here, brother. Over here.

1597
01:38:30,375 --> 01:38:31,583
Why is Brother Bhola here?

1598
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:32,708
Hey, hand it to me.

1599
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:35,500
Brother, do it.

1600
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,791
Not glasses.
I meant the gun.

1601
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:38,750
Take it, brother!

1602
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:40,958
Hey, gun! Does it work?

1603
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,000
- Hey! What are you talking about?
- Brother, move to the right.

1604
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:46,625
Oh, no!

1605
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:49,666
Hey! Loser!

1606
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:50,708
Greetings, sir.

1607
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:53,083
From today,
this house is Bhola's territory!

1608
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:56,083
If anyone eyes this house again,

1609
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:57,833
it's not the headlights that will break.

1610
01:38:58,541 --> 01:38:59,500
It's your heads!

1611
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:00,708
Get lost!

1612
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,208
- Get going!
- Step back.

1613
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:07,166
- How was that?
- Right on, brother.

1614
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,666
Let me get some lemon rice
and porridge for the boys.

1615
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:11,583
Sure. Please, get it.

1616
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:12,791
It's God's will.

1617
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,166
- Sir! These people have brought Bhola.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1618
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,666
- Who is he calling?
- Brother!

1619
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,916
I cannot handle this.
You have to deal with it.

1620
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:20,708
Brother!

1621
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:21,958
Builder Narsingh.

1622
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:24,375
Tell me!

1623
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,583
Bhola, this is Builder Narsingh.

1624
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:27,666
I know. Tell me.

1625
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:28,833
I want that house.

1626
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:30,125
Leave immediately.

1627
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:31,375
How can I do that?

1628
01:39:31,958 --> 01:39:33,041
I have taken an advance.

1629
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:34,375
The deal is done.

1630
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:35,500
How much was the deal?

1631
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:36,583
Fifty…

1632
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,125
One lakh.

1633
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:39,250
I will pay you ten lakhs, Bhola.

1634
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:41,791
Come again?

1635
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:43,250
I will give you ten lakhs, Bhola.

1636
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:45,291
<i>Get them to vacate the house.</i>

1637
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,458
Oh! Send the money.
I will take care of the rest.

1638
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,208
<i>You will get your ten lakhs</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

1639
01:39:50,416 --> 01:39:51,708
{\an8}- Okay?
- Okay.

1640
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:54,375
{\an8}Yes!

1641
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,083
- Doctor uncle!
- He's here.

1642
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:57,250
Doctor uncle!

1643
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:59,166
I was just talking to God about you.

1644
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:01,125
There is a reason for everything, son.

1645
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:03,125
You have come and saved this house.

1646
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:05,708
Uncle…

1647
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:07,541
What happened, dear?

1648
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:12,041
What a gentleman you are, uncle!

1649
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:14,458
You're quite the gentleman too.

1650
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:15,958
Yes, uncle.

1651
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:17,500
I'm a true gentleman.

1652
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:18,833
He's not that great.

1653
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,250
He charged you.

1654
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,666
- What's this?
- Hey, return the money to uncle.

1655
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:24,125
See?

1656
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:26,125
- Count it.
- What about my nose ring?

1657
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:27,541
- Here, take this.
- Take it.

1658
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:29,333
Happy?

1659
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:31,791
- Mr. Bhola!
- Tell me, madam.

1660
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:33,916
I never thought you were so kind!

1661
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,666
Why formalities between us?

1662
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,000
Naughty!

1663
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,041
- How kind you are…
- Hey!

1664
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:43,500
Get his signature acknowledging
that we've returned his money.

1665
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:44,791
- Okay, bother.
- Please sign.

1666
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,541
Yes. I will do it.
What's the big deal?

1667
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:47,791
We do things the corporate way.

1668
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,166
- Proper documentation is essential.
- I am doing it.

1669
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:50,458
Nothing, uncle.

1670
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:51,833
Just to avoid income tax issues.

1671
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:53,583
- Oh! Don't invite them.
- Exactly.

1672
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,625
Carry on.

1673
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:55,958
Uncle!

1674
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:58,750
Are the house documents in order?

1675
01:40:58,916 --> 01:41:01,791
Yes! We have them in the chest,
right, Dad? Show him.

1676
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:04,166
Why wouldn't we show them
to such nice people?

1677
01:41:09,625 --> 01:41:10,625
- Examine them carefully.
- Here you go, son.

1678
01:41:10,708 --> 01:41:12,458
Uncle…
Hand them over, uncle.

1679
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:14,083
Check them. Is everything clear?

1680
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:16,125
Uncle, as if we doubt you?
Everything is perfect, uncle.

1681
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:18,416
- Should I put them back?
- Uncle, let me keep them.

1682
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20,583
- He will take care of it, uncle.
- Nice person!

1683
01:41:20,833 --> 01:41:22,125
- You're all good boys.
- Yes, uncle.

1684
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:23,666
- I don't know, but…
- Good boys.

1685
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,083
Son, the key.

1686
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:27,708
- It's the key to the chest.
- Uncle, he's not going anywhere.

1687
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,875
Didn't you say we are all…

1688
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:31,041
Yeah, I know.

1689
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,625
That we are good boys.

1690
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:33,958
Oh, God!

1691
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:35,625
- It's itchy.
- Long live…

1692
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:36,750
What happened?

1693
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:38,000
Did you bless me, uncle?

1694
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,375
- You bent down, so I blessed you.
- It's okay, uncle.

1695
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:43,791
Total of ten lakhs.

1696
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,000
A house worth four crores.

1697
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:46,833
He settled for a measly ten lakhs.

1698
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:49,125
- Brother!
- What?

1699
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:51,333
He gave us a pittance
and snatched a fortune, brother.

1700
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:52,250
What do you mean?

1701
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:54,708
The house is worth four crores.
He paid us only ten lakhs.

1702
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:56,125
- Hey, PA!
- Brother?

1703
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:58,666
- Get Narsingh on the call.
- I already have, brother.

1704
01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,875
Yes, Bhola!

1705
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:02,500
- Did you receive the payment?
- Yes, I received the advance.

1706
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:03,791
When will you send the balance?

1707
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:05,083
What do you mean by advance?

1708
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:06,666
I sent you all ten.

1709
01:42:07,125 --> 01:42:08,000
Hey!

1710
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:09,625
This house is worth four crores.

1711
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:12,333
My deal is always fifty-fifty.

1712
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:13,500
Let's settle at one crore.

1713
01:42:14,458 --> 01:42:15,333
Okay.

1714
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,458
The ten lakhs you sent is my BST.

1715
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,083
Send the remaining one crore.

1716
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:21,333
The house will be yours.

1717
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:22,708
Uncle!

1718
01:42:22,833 --> 01:42:24,041
- Doctor uncle!
- Coming, son.

1719
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,750
I am just making sure
the porridge is ready.

1720
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:27,000
To give you something sweet.

1721
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:28,000
Hey, uncle!

1722
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:30,250
Let me share the good news.

1723
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,291
- Come and have a seat.
- What is it?

1724
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:32,833
- Come, uncle!
- Slowly!

1725
01:42:33,208 --> 01:42:34,333
Nothing, uncle.

1726
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:36,041
When will you vacate this house?

1727
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:38,333
Why would I vacate the house?

1728
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:39,375
Hey, come on, uncle.

1729
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:41,291
Hey! Help him understand.

1730
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:42,625
You signed a sale agreement
in our brother's name

1731
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:44,083
- Stop it.
- Five minutes ago. Look.

1732
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,333
What's this agreement?

1733
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:47,875
When did I sign it, dear?!

1734
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:50,958
Are you going to stab me?

1735
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:52,416
No, uncle.

1736
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,791
I am eating an apple.

1737
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,916
Drop all this and vacate the house.

1738
01:42:56,375 --> 01:42:58,750
Why is he asking me to vacate?
This is my house, right?

1739
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,833
Hey!

1740
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:02,000
How can he leave the house right now?

1741
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:05,250
Uncle, take ten days and then vacate.

1742
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:06,750
Correct.

1743
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,750
I thought you were a good person.

1744
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,916
No, uncle.
I am a bloody rogue.

1745
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,375
- I don't believe you.
- You have to.

1746
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:13,416
I won't believe you.

1747
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:16,041
You must. I will stab you.

1748
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:17,458
He seems ready to really kill me.

1749
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,791
- Hey!
- Dad!

1750
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,000
Bhola! Are you going to kill him?

1751
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:23,250
Hey, trying to act smart?

1752
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:25,625
- I will bloody kill you first!
- No. Don't.

1753
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,416
He got the house transferred to him.

1754
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:29,500
- Oh no!
- I did exactly that!

1755
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:33,000
- Hey! This will be our den for a few days.
- Brother!

1756
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,041
Okay, brother!

1757
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,291
- Get all our supplies and luggage.
- Okay, brother!

1758
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:38,166
From tonight, it's going to be a blast.

1759
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:40,958
<i>O wine, my dear wine</i>

1760
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,291
<i>You have become my life</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

1761
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:47,000
<i>O wine, my dear wine</i>

1762
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:49,125
<i>- You have become my life</i>
- They are defiling the house.

1763
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:52,125
<i>Only when you're with me, my wine</i>

1764
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:55,458
<i>The whole world rocks, my wine</i>

1765
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:58,291
<i>- Only when you're with me, my wine</i>
- Come on…

1766
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:00,458
<i>The whole world rocks, my wine</i>

1767
01:44:00,541 --> 01:44:02,875
<i>When I don't drink you, my wine!</i>

1768
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,708
<i>Our lives go berserk, O wine</i>

1769
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:07,500
They are downing multiple glasses.

1770
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:10,083
Maybe all the goons drink like this.

1771
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:12,208
<i>O wine, my dear wine</i>

1772
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:14,791
<i>O wine--</i>

1773
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,416
Hey! Stop it!

1774
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:18,041
What happened, brother?

1775
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:19,916
Why are you getting emotional, brother?

1776
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:21,916
- What's the matter, brother?
- Nothing!

1777
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,208
When I got drunk, that great lady…

1778
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:29,041
You're getting hiccups, brother.
Have some water. You'll feel better.

1779
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:31,750
- I don't want plain water.
- Drink it neat, brother.

1780
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,500
- Drink it neat!
- That I'm okay with.

1781
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:35,416
- Bottoms up, brother.
- Yes. You'll let it all out.

1782
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:37,791
- Now, tell me!
- Hey, speak, my friend.

1783
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,416
I'm going to. I am.

1784
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:43,000
If I'm getting drunk and singing in joy,

1785
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:44,791
the reason is…

1786
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,083
that great lady.

1787
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,916
That night you all got drunk
and left, remember?

1788
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:53,291
I was walking home alone.

1789
01:44:53,416 --> 01:44:56,250
That Jitthu came at me with a knife

1790
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:57,541
and stabbed me from behind.

1791
01:44:57,875 --> 01:45:00,333
There was a pool of blood.
It was raining.

1792
01:45:00,458 --> 01:45:03,250
No one…
no one bothered about me.

1793
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:04,958
But that girl…

1794
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,125
I don't know who she is.

1795
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,416
I don't know where she lives.

1796
01:45:09,541 --> 01:45:11,166
She took me to the hospital.

1797
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,500
Gave me her blood

1798
01:45:13,583 --> 01:45:15,208
and saved my life.

1799
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:16,416
My angel!

1800
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:17,541
He's talking about you!

1801
01:45:18,041 --> 01:45:19,250
- Wait…
- I got it, brother.

1802
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:22,916
She gave you her blood, saved you,
and left for heaven.

1803
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:25,791
- Hey! What are you saying?!
- Sorry.

1804
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:29,333
She's an angel who descended
from above to save my life.

1805
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:31,416
- That great lady…
- Yes.

1806
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,583
- She lives somewhere here.
- Yes.

1807
01:45:34,666 --> 01:45:37,041
Brother, what will you do
if you find the girl?

1808
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,083
Idiot!

1809
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,166
Don't call her just a girl.

1810
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,875
She is a great lady.

1811
01:45:41,958 --> 01:45:43,041
- Great lady.
- Great lady.

1812
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:44,541
If I find the great lady…

1813
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:46,000
I will give her my money…

1814
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:48,250
and this building. Everything.

1815
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:49,333
Give it away, brother.

1816
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:51,916
He's not giving it to you
because he doesn't know it's you.

1817
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,791
Mahaa, he's ready
to give the documents back.

1818
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:55,875
- Be quiet. Don't stop me.
<i>- O wine, my dear wine</i>

1819
01:45:55,958 --> 01:45:58,833
<i>- You have become my life…</i>
- Mr. Bhola!

1820
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:01,958
Why are you out of breath?

1821
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,416
Do you want to drink?

1822
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,500
Who do you think gave you blood
and saved you?

1823
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:07,666
- Was it you?
- Not me.

1824
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,458
That great lady who donated blood to you
and saved you is Maha Lakshmi.

1825
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,041
Really?

1826
01:46:22,291 --> 01:46:23,541
Will you return the documents?

1827
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:26,375
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1828
01:46:26,458 --> 01:46:28,125
I have told you now.
Give them back.

1829
01:46:28,541 --> 01:46:29,416
I will!

1830
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:32,458
Both of you…

1831
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:37,625
Let me crush you both with this solid rock

1832
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:39,583
- and turn you into pulp.
- Don't, brother. They are ladies, brother.

1833
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:40,583
Get lost!

1834
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:42,791
- Oh my!
- No, brother.

1835
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:46,875
They overheard us,
and now look at their performance!

1836
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,041
- Planning to seize the house?
- Hey, leave them, dude.

1837
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:50,750
- Great actresses!
- Yes, brother!

1838
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:53,541
I will smash you.

1839
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:56,125
- So cunning! Oh, my!
- Leave it, brother.

1840
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:59,333
<i>O wine, my dear wine</i>

1841
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:00,458
- Dad!
- What happened?

1842
01:47:00,958 --> 01:47:03,000
He seems to have no pity.

1843
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,958
Whatever happens,
will be for our own good.

1844
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,000
Everything happens at God's command.

1845
01:47:08,125 --> 01:47:11,083
Our love and affection
can influence anyone.

1846
01:47:11,583 --> 01:47:14,833
We would rather let Bhola stay here than
lose lives at the hands of the builder.

1847
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:16,541
Don't worry. Carry on.

1848
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:27,416
Great.

1849
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,208
- Hey, Singareni!
- Brother!

1850
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,041
Why did you start this early morning?

1851
01:47:31,125 --> 01:47:32,625
- Yes, brother.
- Let me also have one.

1852
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:34,750
Brother… that's…

1853
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,541
Brother! Why did you waste it?

1854
01:47:39,625 --> 01:47:42,375
- What was that? It was so bitter!
- It's a concoction, brother.

1855
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:44,791
It cleanses your digestive system.

1856
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,166
It's good for heavy drinkers like us.

1857
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:48,500
Doctor uncle told me.

1858
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:50,666
- Told what?
- It <i>hitexes </i>the body.

1859
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,458
It's not <i>hitex.</i> It's detox.

1860
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:53,458
The same.

1861
01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:55,500
- Brother, would you like to have some?
- You have it.

1862
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:57,083
Drink it up.

1863
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:00,750
Hey! What's with you, Lobo?

1864
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,166
Why are you posing like a statue
at the junction?

1865
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:07,166
- Hey, dude! Move aside.
- But why?

1866
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,833
The picture will be spoiled.

1867
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:12,666
Hey, what is this?
You want to pose around now?

1868
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:15,708
- Stop posing! Get lost!
- Lobo! Don't move.

1869
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:16,875
Whatever!

1870
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:19,708
Mahaa!

1871
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,208
- I will somehow steal the key.
- Hey! What's wrong with you?

1872
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:25,083
I will get the documents
from the chest.

1873
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:26,666
I will show them my talent.

1874
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,375
Mr. Bhola!

1875
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,625
Mr. Bhola!

1876
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:00,125
- Yes?
- You saw it.

1877
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:02,041
What?

1878
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:03,333
You saw it.

1879
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:05,333
I saw it.

1880
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:07,500
Otherwise, I will lose the count.
The count…

1881
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:10,208
I wasn't talking about your counting.
I was talking about your looks.

1882
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:11,291
You saw my waist.

1883
01:50:12,208 --> 01:50:14,333
What? Me?
And your waist?

1884
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,125
No, not at all.

1885
01:50:17,416 --> 01:50:18,375
I didn't see it.

1886
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,458
Don't say "uh, uh" so innocently.

1887
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:23,625
I saw you seeing it.

1888
01:50:24,916 --> 01:50:27,166
I actually tried.
But I couldn't find it.

1889
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:29,583
Still, it was wrong to see.

1890
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,000
Fine, I saw.

1891
01:50:33,958 --> 01:50:35,583
The eyes are a part of your body.

1892
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:37,083
The nose is a part of your body.

1893
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,458
The waist is also a part of your body.

1894
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:40,291
It's not wrong to see them.

1895
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:41,708
How is looking at the waist wrong?

1896
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:47,791
Mr. Bhola!

1897
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:50,166
I didn't like you looking at my waist.

1898
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:52,250
It was visible, so I saw it.

1899
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:53,541
I am hurt.

1900
01:50:56,416 --> 01:51:00,833
<i>As the girl smiled slightly</i>
<i>Boys have lost their minds.</i>

1901
01:51:01,583 --> 01:51:02,583
What?

1902
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,291
What is this?

1903
01:51:14,125 --> 01:51:15,208
Get lost!

1904
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:16,625
Don't act smart!

1905
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:18,291
Lobo!

1906
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,875
- Have some more.
- It's delicious.

1907
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:25,458
I want popadam.

1908
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:30,166
- What happened?
- They are too affectionate, brother.

1909
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:32,583
- It's delicious.
- They are killing me with love.

1910
01:51:32,666 --> 01:51:34,291
What is this, brother?
Eat.

1911
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:42,583
Good morning, brother.

1912
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:44,875
What is happening?
Why are you dressed like a priest?

1913
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,208
I have become a
disciple of Master, brother.

1914
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:50,666
This is more peaceful
than your business.

1915
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,625
Mad fellow!

1916
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,791
Why don't you also consider it?
It feels good.

1917
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:55,791
- You bloody…
- Oh, God! Don't.

1918
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:57,833
My God!
There is no room for violence here.

1919
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:01,458
Along with your dress,
your diction has also changed.

1920
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:03,666
- Hey!
- Oh, God!

1921
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,916
It's me, brother. Chitti Muthyam.

1922
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,041
What is this?

1923
01:52:06,166 --> 01:52:08,000
Why do you look like a pig in the mud?

1924
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:10,583
This is not mud, brother.
This is Multani soil.

1925
01:52:10,791 --> 01:52:13,625
The doctor said
it makes dark skin fair.

1926
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:15,166
He is full of tips like this.

1927
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,541
Does a buffalo rolling in mud come out
as a white cow?

1928
01:52:17,958 --> 01:52:19,750
- Let's go.
- I am busy. I cannot come.

1929
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,041
What keeps you so busy?

1930
01:52:21,166 --> 01:52:22,125
Aunty said…

1931
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:24,958
she will teach me how to make snacks.

1932
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:25,958
- I want to learn.
- Chitti Muthyam,

1933
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:28,375
- Coming, Aunty. Bye.
- Come here, son.

1934
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:31,458
What is the doctor giving them?

1935
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:33,458
Everyone is acting strange.

1936
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,708
On this Shivaratri,
let us remember…

1937
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:42,125
- Lord Shiva and say, "Hail Shankara!"
- Hail Shankara!

1938
01:52:42,875 --> 01:52:45,916
<i>Hail Shankara!</i>

1939
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:50,333
<i>Hail Shankara!</i>

1940
01:52:50,416 --> 01:52:51,375
Please, carry on, son.

1941
01:53:00,666 --> 01:53:01,916
Where is it? I can't find it.

1942
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,666
What are you looking for?
Documents?

1943
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:07,666
I sent the documents to the builder.

1944
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:12,458
- But I want them.
- Do you?

1945
01:53:12,541 --> 01:53:14,125
- Yes.
- Come out.

1946
01:53:14,333 --> 01:53:15,416
You will hit me.

1947
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,416
No, I won't.

1948
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:21,500
- Will you give it to me?
- I will skin you, you bloody…

1949
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:23,791
Acting smart!

1950
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:27,375
Hey! What is this? Get up!

1951
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:30,541
Mr. Bhola!

1952
01:53:31,125 --> 01:53:33,416
My future depends
on those documents.

1953
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,625
I need them
to secure a loan for my studies.

1954
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:36,750
To hell with your studies!

1955
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
You must vacate the house by tomorrow.

1956
01:53:38,875 --> 01:53:39,750
Get going.

1957
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:41,541
- Go, move!
- Actually, It's not that…

1958
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:43,083
- I am trying to say…
- Hey! Move.

1959
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:46,666
Bhola! I got the documents.

1960
01:53:46,958 --> 01:53:49,000
But they should be signed
by the doctor's daughter as well.

1961
01:53:49,083 --> 01:53:51,208
Get her signature
and then collect your money.

1962
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:52,458
I will get it right now.

1963
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:53,791
Get the one crore ready.

1964
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:55,000
Okay.

1965
01:53:55,541 --> 01:53:56,500
Hey, uncle!

1966
01:53:56,708 --> 01:53:57,875
Where is your daughter?

1967
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,291
She went to college, son.

1968
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:00,791
Pack your things.

1969
01:54:00,916 --> 01:54:02,375
You must vacate the house this evening.

1970
01:54:12,666 --> 01:54:13,500
Hey!

1971
01:54:15,333 --> 01:54:16,166
Let's go.

1972
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:21,583
Hey, hey! Who are you?

1973
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:22,875
Let go!

1974
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:26,583
{\an8}Help!

1975
01:54:28,083 --> 01:54:28,916
Bhola!

1976
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,666
Take her there!

1977
01:55:02,916 --> 01:55:04,541
<i>- Yes, Chotu?</i>
- Two buses.

1978
01:55:05,125 --> 01:55:06,500
Hyderabad to Kolkata.

1979
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:08,666
Organized it like a college tour.

1980
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,958
Crores of currency.

1981
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:11,666
<i>Be careful at the checkpoint.</i>

1982
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:14,875
They have kidnapped us for trafficking.

1983
01:55:19,666 --> 01:55:22,375
<i>I will clear those two buses at customs…</i>

1984
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:25,125
<i>and send them on a cruise.</i>
<i>No problem.</i>

1985
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:26,625
All set.

1986
01:55:27,083 --> 01:55:28,166
Good to go for sale.

1987
01:55:28,833 --> 01:55:31,875
We will never see our families again.

1988
01:55:32,333 --> 01:55:34,583
It's going to be hell
for the rest of our lives.

1989
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:45,250
There. That's him.
He is coming.

1990
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:46,916
He will give us an injection now.

1991
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:51,500
- Hey, quiet!
- No, please!

1992
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:53,500
- Not even God can save you now.
- Please!

1993
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:08,458
Go and check.

1994
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,458
Who the heck are you?

1995
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:42,916
A lion on a stroll, buddy.

1996
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,125
Hey, I think he's here for the girl.

1997
01:56:45,208 --> 01:56:47,833
If something goes wrong,
everything will be exposed.

1998
01:56:47,916 --> 01:56:48,791
Kill him!

1999
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:52,875
Speak up! Tell me!

2000
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:54,875
Who is your boss?
Where does he live?

2001
01:58:54,958 --> 01:58:56,541
Brother, I don't know anyone.

2002
01:58:56,625 --> 01:58:57,875
They all live in Kolkata.

2003
01:58:58,041 --> 01:58:59,500
Where are you running? Hey!

2004
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:18,750
Come, son.

2005
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:25,208
I always believed it wasn't for money
or property that you entered our lives.

2006
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:27,500
I was right.

2007
01:59:28,291 --> 01:59:29,166
I don't have a son.

2008
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:32,166
But by saving so many girls
along with my daughter,

2009
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,333
you've become their brother.

2010
01:59:36,458 --> 01:59:38,708
You've become Lord Rama
for so many families.

2011
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:44,708
I keep saying, "God's will.
Everything happens for a reason."

2012
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,708
What could be a bigger reason
than this for you to arrive?

2013
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:52,333
You were born with a purpose, son.

2014
01:59:52,666 --> 01:59:53,875
- I didn't…
- It's not that, son.

2015
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:57,666
God has sent you for us.

2016
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:03,458
Stay blessed forever,
with our years added to yours.

2017
02:00:17,083 --> 02:00:17,916
Brother!

2018
02:00:20,625 --> 02:00:21,500
Thank you.

2019
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:37,458
Welcome, Bhola! Welcome!

2020
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:39,000
Your one crore is ready.

2021
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:41,708
Why have you come alone?

2022
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:42,833
Where is the girl?

2023
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,166
I need her signature.

2024
02:00:44,250 --> 02:00:46,666
She is not going to come.
She is not going to sign.

2025
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:47,708
Give me those papers.

2026
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:50,083
Are you trying to mess with me?

2027
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:53,666
Hey! Go, get the girl.

2028
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:55,625
I will see who can stop me.

2029
02:01:17,041 --> 02:01:18,708
Don't interfere with that house.

2030
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:20,250
They are my people.

2031
02:01:20,833 --> 02:01:21,833
Understand?

2032
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,375
What were you doing?!

2033
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:39,833
Where is the hard disk?!

2034
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:42,666
It has all our details.

2035
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:43,875
Damn it!

2036
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,208
Get the lamp.

2037
02:02:03,291 --> 02:02:04,458
Coming!

2038
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:07,291
- Swamy!
- Mahaa…

2039
02:02:07,708 --> 02:02:09,375
- Why is he barking? Check.
- Swamy!

2040
02:02:26,583 --> 02:02:29,250
- Go, be with Mahaa. She is alone.
- Okay.

2041
02:02:33,625 --> 02:02:34,500
Mahaa…

2042
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:36,875
Who are you?

2043
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:39,375
- Who are all of you?
- Who is it?

2044
02:02:39,708 --> 02:02:40,541
Husband!

2045
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:44,458
Hey!

2046
02:02:52,041 --> 02:02:52,916
You mother…

2047
02:03:45,458 --> 02:03:46,375
Dad!

2048
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:49,500
- Mahaa! Leave!
- Dad…

2049
02:03:49,916 --> 02:03:51,083
- Dad!
- Mahaa, leave!

2050
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:52,458
Dad!

2051
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:54,458
Da…

2052
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:02,625
Brother, she has the hard disk.

2053
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:05,166
Don't let her get away.
Go, get the hard disk.

2054
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:46,208
Give it!

2055
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,166
You…

2056
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,500
Dear?

2057
02:05:30,208 --> 02:05:31,041
Mahaa!

2058
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:52,958
Please wait here.

2059
02:06:06,916 --> 02:06:08,458
Sir, what is the patient's name?

2060
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:11,291
Maha Lakshmi.

2061
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:12,500
How are you related to her?

2062
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:14,125
He's her brother.

2063
02:06:14,708 --> 02:06:16,791
When he was fighting
for his life the other day,

2064
02:06:16,875 --> 02:06:19,791
she brought him in time,
donated her blood, and saved him.

2065
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:22,791
- Give me these medicines.
- Okay, sister.

2066
02:06:23,166 --> 02:06:24,416
Your sister will be fine.

2067
02:07:06,458 --> 02:07:08,291
I guess you are Maha Lakshmi's brother.

2068
02:07:09,625 --> 02:07:11,791
We have operated
on all her abdominal wounds.

2069
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:13,041
We tried our best.

2070
02:07:13,125 --> 02:07:14,708
But the head injury
is the major issue.

2071
02:07:14,916 --> 02:07:17,791
We don't have the proper equipment
to treat her here.

2072
02:07:17,875 --> 02:07:18,958
No surgeons either.

2073
02:07:19,125 --> 02:07:21,541
Rush her to a super specialty hospital.

2074
02:07:21,625 --> 02:07:23,250
She needs a neurosurgeon immediately.

2075
02:07:28,041 --> 02:07:28,916
Be careful.

2076
02:07:30,166 --> 02:07:31,375
Brother, sign here.

2077
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:37,625
- Pay the bill.
- Okay, brother.

2078
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:19,416
- Doctor?
- Please, come.

2079
02:08:19,791 --> 02:08:21,500
The patient has emerged from a coma,

2080
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:24,000
But…

2081
02:08:24,166 --> 02:08:25,958
she has completely lost her memory
of the past.

2082
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:30,583
She doesn't even recall her parents.

2083
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:34,583
She remembers nothing of her life.

2084
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,500
She is like a blank paper now.

2085
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:40,791
Whatever you choose
to tell her from now on…

2086
02:08:41,416 --> 02:08:42,583
will become her past.

2087
02:08:45,333 --> 02:08:46,416
- So, doctor--
- Doctor!

2088
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:49,125
- The patient is getting a panic attack.
- Come.

2089
02:08:52,458 --> 02:08:53,333
Who are they?

2090
02:08:54,083 --> 02:08:55,625
- Don't panic. Relax.
- I'm unable to recognize them.

2091
02:08:55,708 --> 02:08:57,000
- Relax. You will be okay.
- Doctor…

2092
02:08:58,125 --> 02:08:59,000
Doctor! Who are they?

2093
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:05,875
I can't recall anything.

2094
02:09:26,791 --> 02:09:27,625
He is…

2095
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:29,083
He is…

2096
02:09:31,541 --> 02:09:33,166
- Please come.
- I know him.

2097
02:09:36,916 --> 02:09:37,750
Doctor…

2098
02:09:38,208 --> 02:09:39,041
He is…

2099
02:09:39,625 --> 02:09:40,541
Who is he?

2100
02:09:43,375 --> 02:09:44,583
I know him.

2101
02:09:45,333 --> 02:09:46,583
He…

2102
02:09:55,166 --> 02:09:56,125
Brother.

2103
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,166
Of course, I am your brother, dear.

2104
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:00,958
Brother.

2105
02:10:01,958 --> 02:10:04,750
Brother, don't leave me alone.

2106
02:10:05,708 --> 02:10:07,041
I am afraid.

2107
02:10:07,125 --> 02:10:08,208
Why should you be afraid?

2108
02:10:09,375 --> 02:10:10,666
I am right here.

2109
02:10:11,416 --> 02:10:14,208
Brother, don't leave me.

2110
02:10:15,833 --> 02:10:16,708
Don't leave me.

2111
02:10:18,208 --> 02:10:21,583
I am scared.

2112
02:10:21,666 --> 02:10:22,666
Don't be afraid.

2113
02:10:25,833 --> 02:10:27,000
I am right here.

2114
02:10:27,708 --> 02:10:29,875
Brother, don't leave me alone.

2115
02:10:30,083 --> 02:10:31,041
I will never leave you, dear.

2116
02:10:32,375 --> 02:10:33,666
Never.

2117
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:43,541
<i>Maha Lakshmi has no memory</i>
<i>of her past whatsoever.</i>

2118
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:46,625
<i>She believes</i>
<i>her parents died in an accident,</i>

2119
02:10:46,958 --> 02:10:49,291
<i>and I am her biological brother.</i>

2120
02:10:49,916 --> 02:10:51,416
<i>I have no one else,</i>

2121
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:53,750
and Mahaa has become my world.

2122
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,375
She doesn't know me as the rowdy Bhola.

2123
02:11:00,625 --> 02:11:04,125
She recognizes me
only as her caring brother, Shankar.

2124
02:11:05,375 --> 02:11:08,125
I could have
taken care of her in Hyderabad,

2125
02:11:08,625 --> 02:11:09,541
but…

2126
02:11:09,833 --> 02:11:13,208
with the intent of putting an end
to the mafia responsible for her condition

2127
02:11:13,416 --> 02:11:17,958
and dismantling the gangs
that treat girls as commodities for sale,

2128
02:11:18,208 --> 02:11:19,750
I have come to Kolkata.

2129
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:24,375
I'm eliminating
the city's most wanted criminals.

2130
02:11:25,083 --> 02:11:27,083
I was concerned that Mahaa would be alone

2131
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:29,958
if something happened
to me in the process.

2132
02:11:30,375 --> 02:11:32,083
That's when your brother
fell in love with her,

2133
02:11:32,583 --> 02:11:34,125
leading to this wedding.

2134
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:38,541
Mahaa should remain oblivious to her past
and my mission.

2135
02:11:39,833 --> 02:11:41,833
Also, this wedding must take place.

2136
02:11:42,416 --> 02:11:44,583
Don't stop it. Please.

2137
02:11:46,041 --> 02:11:49,208
Mahaa is fortunate
to have a brother like you.

2138
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:53,583
The wedding will take place
as you envisioned.

2139
02:11:54,291 --> 02:11:55,208
Thank you.

2140
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:39,083
By arriving here at this hour,
sir, you're endangering everyone.

2141
02:12:39,291 --> 02:12:42,041
I can risk this job for money
but I won't jeopardize my life.

2142
02:12:42,125 --> 02:12:43,375
I can no longer work with you.

2143
02:12:50,458 --> 02:12:51,458
What about you?

2144
02:12:52,333 --> 02:12:54,250
One of your men
is barely clinging to life.

2145
02:12:56,666 --> 02:12:59,375
I'm overseeing his treatment covertly
at your own location.

2146
02:12:59,541 --> 02:13:02,875
Once he awakens from his coma,
we'll identify the killer.

2147
02:13:06,125 --> 02:13:06,958
This is the guy.

2148
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:09,500
Doctor, what's his status?

2149
02:13:09,583 --> 02:13:11,250
His condition is very critical.

2150
02:13:11,375 --> 02:13:13,875
- His chances of survival are minimal.
- He must survive!

2151
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:17,250
You need to save two lives.

2152
02:13:17,333 --> 02:13:19,166
His and yours!

2153
02:13:21,541 --> 02:13:24,000
I want that assassin!

2154
02:13:24,083 --> 02:13:25,458
SHRIKAR AND MAHAA'S
PRE-WEDDING MUSICAL CELEBRATION

2155
02:13:31,958 --> 02:13:33,625
Why is everyone so somber?

2156
02:13:33,916 --> 02:13:36,125
Where is the enthusiasm?
Where is the energy?

2157
02:13:36,291 --> 02:13:38,291
Brother-in-law,
kick off the musical celebration!

2158
02:13:38,375 --> 02:13:39,375
Brother, come on! Please.

2159
02:13:39,458 --> 02:13:41,416
- Master, let's begin!
- Please!

2160
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:43,333
DJ, start the music!

2161
02:13:57,208 --> 02:14:02,291
<i>Beat the drums, play the rhythm</i>
<i>Wow! Hey, sing a lively song</i>

2162
02:14:06,708 --> 02:14:12,000
<i>Whistle out and watch</i>
<i>Let your dance break all barriers today</i>

2163
02:14:16,583 --> 02:14:21,250
<i>Match the tempo and embrace the beat</i>

2164
02:14:21,333 --> 02:14:25,750
<i>Jump, groove, shake it up</i>
<i>Bring the roof down</i>

2165
02:14:25,833 --> 02:14:30,666
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2166
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:35,541
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2167
02:14:44,791 --> 02:14:49,750
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2168
02:14:49,833 --> 02:14:54,458
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2169
02:15:10,416 --> 02:15:13,666
Brothers, I need some change.

2170
02:15:13,916 --> 02:15:15,958
Alter the rhythm and play another song.

2171
02:15:16,958 --> 02:15:19,250
<i>Hey, Narsapalli…</i>

2172
02:15:19,625 --> 02:15:21,833
<i>Narsapalli…</i>

2173
02:15:21,916 --> 02:15:26,791
<i>In Narsapalli gorge, Gangadhari</i>
<i>I met a rustic girl, Gangadhari</i>

2174
02:15:26,875 --> 02:15:31,625
<i>In Narsapalli gorge, Gangadhari</i>
<i>I met a rustic girl, Gangadhari</i>

2175
02:15:32,666 --> 02:15:34,125
<i>I met her, Gangadhari</i>

2176
02:15:35,125 --> 02:15:36,250
<i>I met her, Gangadhari</i>

2177
02:15:36,333 --> 02:15:38,583
<i>For the words</i>
<i>Of the rustic girl, Gangadhari</i>

2178
02:15:38,666 --> 02:15:41,041
<i>The macho man took the lead, Gangadhari</i>

2179
02:15:41,125 --> 02:15:45,750
<i>In the Narsapalli gorge, Gangadhari</i>
<i>I liked the boss of mass, Gangadhari</i>

2180
02:15:45,833 --> 02:15:51,000
<i>When I liked the boss of mass, Gangadhari</i>
<i>I surrendered my heart to him, Gangadhari</i>

2181
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:13,958
<i>Open your heart, dance away to glory</i>

2182
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:17,625
<i>Spread the essence</i>
<i>Of your mischief all around</i>

2183
02:16:18,708 --> 02:16:21,083
<i>This is a thrill</i>
<i>From mind-numbing intoxication</i>

2184
02:16:21,166 --> 02:16:27,125
<i>Stretch the bow of your pleasure</i>
<i>Come on, shake it until it echoes</i>

2185
02:16:28,541 --> 02:16:32,916
<i>Ko, ko, ko, play it up</i>
<i>Celebrate a thousand times</i>

2186
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,791
<i>Hey, ko, ko, ko, use it up</i>
<i>Time never comes back</i>

2187
02:16:36,875 --> 02:16:37,916
<i>Come on!</i>

2188
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,458
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2189
02:16:42,541 --> 02:16:47,416
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2190
02:16:56,791 --> 02:17:01,625
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2191
02:17:01,708 --> 02:17:06,625
<i>Jam Jam Jajjanaka</i>
<i>Let's dance the whole night</i>

2192
02:17:11,666 --> 02:17:13,083
Sir, he is regaining consciousness,

2193
02:17:14,125 --> 02:17:15,583
but his pulse is dropping.

2194
02:17:15,708 --> 02:17:17,541
We don't know how long he will survive.

2195
02:17:18,083 --> 02:17:20,416
We don't know how long he will last.
What should we do, sir?

2196
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,291
We immediately need a forensic artist!

2197
02:17:22,375 --> 02:17:26,541
Get the sketch of the killer done
while he's still alive.

2198
02:17:26,625 --> 02:17:28,000
Go, get the artist for me now!

2199
02:17:28,375 --> 02:17:31,333
Sir, it's quite risky to involve an artist
from my department.

2200
02:17:31,416 --> 02:17:33,875
Victoria Arts College is nearby.
I will arrange for one from there.

2201
02:17:33,958 --> 02:17:35,375
- Go! Quickly bring in an artist!
- Okay, sir!

2202
02:17:35,458 --> 02:17:38,625
Sir, an Adromin injection
might help him last for an hour.

2203
02:17:41,208 --> 02:17:43,000
- Actually, that's…
- Excuse me, ma'am!

2204
02:17:43,083 --> 02:17:43,916
Yes!

2205
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:45,500
Sorry. Ma'am!

2206
02:17:45,583 --> 02:17:46,625
My wedding invitation.

2207
02:17:46,791 --> 02:17:49,041
- Oh! Congratulations, Maha Lakshmi.
- Thank you!

2208
02:17:49,125 --> 02:17:50,041
Mahaa!

2209
02:17:50,333 --> 02:17:52,583
- He is a crime branch inspector.
- Hello!

2210
02:17:52,666 --> 02:17:55,083
They urgently need a sketch artist.

2211
02:17:55,166 --> 02:17:56,250
Can you please help them?

2212
02:17:56,791 --> 02:17:57,708
Now?

2213
02:17:57,791 --> 02:17:59,375
Please, madam.
It's a medical emergency.

2214
02:18:00,583 --> 02:18:02,625
- Okay, ma'am!
- Thank you, ma'am. Come.

2215
02:18:15,166 --> 02:18:16,000
One minute.

2216
02:18:16,333 --> 02:18:19,166
{\an8}Mahaa! I'm at the college. Where are you?

2217
02:18:19,291 --> 02:18:23,625
Brother, the Principal has sent me with
Khalighat SI to create a forensic sketch.

2218
02:18:24,708 --> 02:18:26,208
Oh! Fine, dear.

2219
02:18:26,541 --> 02:18:28,916
I will come and pick you up.
Share your location.

2220
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,875
Brother, sure.

2221
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:57,958
It's him!

2222
02:18:58,291 --> 02:18:59,541
It's him!

2223
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:03,000
It's him!

2224
02:19:03,416 --> 02:19:04,916
- Is he the one?
- Yes!

2225
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,916
- It's him!
- No…

2226
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,625
- Look! Take a proper look.
- It's him!

2227
02:19:08,708 --> 02:19:10,166
- It's him!
- Take a look.

2228
02:19:10,250 --> 02:19:12,208
- Take a good look. Tell me. Is this him?
- He is the one!

2229
02:19:13,541 --> 02:19:14,375
Sir, he's dead!

2230
02:19:15,208 --> 02:19:17,166
Oh no! He's mistaken.

2231
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:18,166
This is my brother.

2232
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:19,833
- This is…
- Brother?

2233
02:19:19,916 --> 02:19:21,500
Hey! He is a taxi driver, right?

2234
02:19:21,583 --> 02:19:22,833
- Yes!
- Taxi driver?

2235
02:19:23,125 --> 02:19:24,916
I was just talking to my brother…

2236
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
So, in the confusion,
I ended up sketching his features.

2237
02:19:27,208 --> 02:19:28,291
It was a mistake.

2238
02:19:29,208 --> 02:19:30,833
Sorry! I will redraw it.

2239
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:33,416
Taxi driver?

2240
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,666
- It was unintentional.
- Your brother?

2241
02:19:35,291 --> 02:19:36,666
- Brother! Your brother?
- Yes.

2242
02:19:37,041 --> 02:19:38,000
No problem.

2243
02:19:38,125 --> 02:19:40,208
- It's not that--
- It's okay. He is coming, right?

2244
02:19:40,291 --> 02:19:41,708
- He is coming!
- He is coming.

2245
02:19:41,916 --> 02:19:43,375
- But it's not him.
- No problem.

2246
02:19:43,458 --> 02:19:45,041
- It was a mistake.
- It's okay! Relax.

2247
02:19:45,125 --> 02:19:46,041
Have a seat.

2248
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:48,541
- Something is amiss.
- It's okay! Relax.

2249
02:19:48,625 --> 02:19:49,791
- We'll take care.
- The sketch ended up looking like him.

2250
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:51,291
He didn't give me a clear description.

2251
02:19:52,333 --> 02:19:54,125
Please hear me out, sir!

2252
02:19:54,583 --> 02:19:55,458
Please, sir!

2253
02:20:02,833 --> 02:20:04,666
Your brother is coming, right?

2254
02:20:05,083 --> 02:20:06,083
He's coming, sir!

2255
02:20:42,541 --> 02:20:43,375
Brother!

2256
02:20:43,583 --> 02:20:45,583
- What happened?
- I made an error.

2257
02:20:45,666 --> 02:20:47,083
What do you mean by error?
What happened, dear?

2258
02:20:47,166 --> 02:20:49,291
After I spoke with you on the phone,
I was thinking about you…

2259
02:20:49,458 --> 02:20:52,541
and unintentionally drew your sketch
instead of the criminal's. That's all!

2260
02:20:52,958 --> 02:20:53,791
Sir!

2261
02:20:54,291 --> 02:20:55,125
Brother!

2262
02:20:55,208 --> 02:20:56,125
What is this, sir?

2263
02:20:57,458 --> 02:20:59,416
- You…
- I told you.

2264
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:02,000
It was a mistake.
My brother is innocent.

2265
02:21:02,625 --> 02:21:04,208
- Sir…
- Leave my brother. Please.

2266
02:21:17,541 --> 02:21:18,375
Put it down.

2267
02:21:21,666 --> 02:21:23,083
Shankar, take her and go.

2268
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:24,708
Okay, thank you, sir.

2269
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:27,583
- Brother!
- Let's go, dear.

2270
02:21:27,666 --> 02:21:29,791
- I unintentionally drew it, brother.
- Let's go!

2271
02:21:57,041 --> 02:21:58,083
Let's go quickly, dear.

2272
02:22:02,125 --> 02:22:03,041
Sorry, sir.

2273
02:22:03,666 --> 02:22:06,291
He threatened to kill my family, sir.

2274
02:22:07,416 --> 02:22:08,958
- Husband!
- Sorry, sir.

2275
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:13,458
Mahaa, don't tell anyone what happened.

2276
02:22:14,166 --> 02:22:15,458
Stay relaxed.

2277
02:22:16,583 --> 02:22:17,708
- Where are they?
- There they are.

2278
02:22:17,791 --> 02:22:19,000
Here. They are all here.

2279
02:22:20,083 --> 02:22:21,250
Welcome, Miss Maha Lakshmi.

2280
02:22:21,333 --> 02:22:23,083
We have been waiting
for your jewelry shopping.

2281
02:22:23,625 --> 02:22:25,708
- Carry on, dear. I'll join you. Go ahead.
- Come, dear! Come!

2282
02:22:26,083 --> 02:22:27,166
- Let's go!
- Bye, sir!

2283
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:32,916
What happened?

2284
02:22:33,250 --> 02:22:34,583
You look worried.

2285
02:22:34,875 --> 02:22:36,416
Alex is in Kolkata.

2286
02:22:37,083 --> 02:22:38,625
He has identified me.

2287
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,083
There could be an attack
on me at any moment.

2288
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:47,583
Keep Mahaa safe.

2289
02:22:47,666 --> 02:22:49,583
Certainly. Mahaa will be fine.

2290
02:22:51,208 --> 02:22:54,000
But why not involve the police?

2291
02:22:56,291 --> 02:22:57,166
Alex!

2292
02:22:59,166 --> 02:23:00,041
Tell me.

2293
02:23:00,625 --> 02:23:04,958
You just rescued your sister
right in front of me.

2294
02:23:05,291 --> 02:23:09,458
Now, I've abducted her
right under your nose. Check.

2295
02:23:10,208 --> 02:23:12,125
- Check if Mahaa is with your brother.
- Okay!

2296
02:23:12,666 --> 02:23:13,625
Come.

2297
02:23:14,375 --> 02:23:15,333
Come!

2298
02:23:15,458 --> 02:23:17,375
Come to my warehouse.

2299
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:19,333
Shrikar, where is Mahaa?

2300
02:23:19,458 --> 02:23:21,458
Someone took her,
saying her brother was calling for her.

2301
02:23:25,625 --> 02:23:27,333
Shankar! Shankar, what happened?

2302
02:23:28,833 --> 02:23:29,833
Who was on the phone?

2303
02:23:30,708 --> 02:23:31,541
Where?

2304
02:23:31,625 --> 02:23:32,500
Where are you going?

2305
02:23:33,291 --> 02:23:34,125
Tell me, Shankar!

2306
02:23:34,458 --> 02:23:35,708
Where is Mahaa?
What happened to Mahaa?

2307
02:23:35,916 --> 02:23:36,916
Mahaa will be fine.

2308
02:23:37,041 --> 02:23:39,375
Whether I return or not,
Mahaa will definitely come back.

2309
02:23:39,458 --> 02:23:41,208
- She will marry your brother.
- Shankar…

2310
02:23:58,583 --> 02:24:00,250
Mahaa!

2311
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:03,458
Where is my sister?

2312
02:24:04,458 --> 02:24:05,375
Tell me!

2313
02:24:11,041 --> 02:24:11,875
Tell me!

2314
02:24:13,541 --> 02:24:15,125
I killed her.

2315
02:24:20,625 --> 02:24:23,916
Just a lie about your sister's death,
and you are so agitated!

2316
02:24:24,833 --> 02:24:27,250
But you actually killed my brother.
How do you think I would feel?!

2317
02:24:28,333 --> 02:24:32,291
You made my own man point a gun at me
and took your sister.

2318
02:24:32,875 --> 02:24:35,041
But now your sister is with me.

2319
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:36,791
Do you know
who brought your sister to me?

2320
02:24:37,333 --> 02:24:39,708
You brought your sister here.

2321
02:24:40,625 --> 02:24:41,875
In your taxi.

2322
02:24:42,708 --> 02:24:43,916
Get her out.

2323
02:24:50,916 --> 02:24:51,791
Mahaa!

2324
02:24:55,291 --> 02:25:01,625
My brothers, my gang, my business…
you destroyed everything for your sister.

2325
02:25:01,875 --> 02:25:07,250
But now I will restart my business
with your sister.

2326
02:25:07,625 --> 02:25:11,750
No one will be able to trace
who she was sold to.

2327
02:25:13,875 --> 02:25:14,708
Kill him!

2328
02:26:10,625 --> 02:26:11,666
- Hello?
- Brother!

2329
02:26:12,333 --> 02:26:13,166
Mahaa!

2330
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:15,291
- Dear, where are you calling from?
- I don't know!

2331
02:26:15,375 --> 02:26:16,250
Where are you now?

2332
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,333
I am in a car. In the trunk.

2333
02:26:18,416 --> 02:26:19,875
Dear, can you look outside?

2334
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,541
Let me try.

2335
02:26:23,250 --> 02:26:24,333
Yes, I can see.

2336
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:26,875
See, dear.

2337
02:26:27,541 --> 02:26:29,958
You will come across some landmarks.
Notice them and keep telling me.

2338
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:33,250
- Biswa Bangla Gate.
- I am coming, dear.

2339
02:26:33,333 --> 02:26:34,166
I am coming.

2340
02:26:34,666 --> 02:26:36,375
Tell me. What else can you see?

2341
02:26:37,458 --> 02:26:39,625
Eden Gardens…
Brother, I can see Eden Gardens.

2342
02:26:39,833 --> 02:26:40,875
I am coming exactly the same way.

2343
02:26:43,916 --> 02:26:45,666
I am now on Howrah Bridge.

2344
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:48,666
I am coming that way, dear.

2345
02:26:50,291 --> 02:26:51,583
- Brother?
- Tell me, dear.

2346
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:52,750
I think the car has stopped.

2347
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,083
I think it has stopped in traffic.

2348
02:26:58,166 --> 02:26:59,541
- Yes.
- I am close.

2349
02:26:59,625 --> 02:27:00,458
I am coming, dear.

2350
02:27:01,333 --> 02:27:02,875
Mahaa! What else can you see, dear?

2351
02:27:02,958 --> 02:27:04,500
I can see an overbridge.

2352
02:27:05,375 --> 02:27:06,250
A green one.

2353
02:27:06,916 --> 02:27:07,791
I have found it.

2354
02:27:07,875 --> 02:27:09,000
I am getting on the bridge.

2355
02:27:12,166 --> 02:27:13,000
{\an8}Hello?

2356
02:27:13,083 --> 02:27:14,083
{\an8}- Mahaa!
- Brother!

2357
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:15,541
I am on the bridge.

2358
02:27:18,208 --> 02:27:19,250
Dear, can you see me?

2359
02:27:23,958 --> 02:27:25,166
- Brother!
- Mahaa!

2360
02:27:25,625 --> 02:27:27,666
I just raised my hand. Can you see me?

2361
02:27:27,875 --> 02:27:28,708
Brother!

2362
02:27:29,208 --> 02:27:31,250
Brother, I can see you.

2363
02:27:31,375 --> 02:27:33,333
Forward or backward?
Which way are you looking?

2364
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:35,625
Forward…

2365
02:27:40,375 --> 02:27:41,208
Mahaa,

2366
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:43,708
you'll find a box near the hazard light.

2367
02:27:43,791 --> 02:27:44,916
Please open it.

2368
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,416
Can you see lots of wires?

2369
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:49,500
- Yes.
- You will find a joint, dear. Cut it.

2370
02:27:49,583 --> 02:27:50,625
I am not able to.

2371
02:27:51,625 --> 02:27:52,458
Quickly, dear.

2372
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:54,583
Brother, I'm not able to cut it.

2373
02:27:56,583 --> 02:27:58,166
Dear, the signal will change
at any moment. Fast.

2374
02:28:00,083 --> 02:28:01,041
{\an8}Cut it, dear.

2375
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:04,541
The light is off.
I have found your car, dear.

2376
02:28:06,416 --> 02:28:07,250
I saw you.

2377
02:28:08,666 --> 02:28:09,583
I am coming.

2378
02:28:09,666 --> 02:28:10,791
Brother, come fast!

2379
02:28:39,416 --> 02:28:40,333
Mahaa!

2380
02:29:03,125 --> 02:29:04,083
Brother…

2381
02:29:08,875 --> 02:29:10,875
Brother…

2382
02:29:13,583 --> 02:29:14,458
Brother…

2383
02:29:17,083 --> 02:29:18,000
I see.

2384
02:29:18,166 --> 02:29:21,458
- Are you ready to die for your sister?
- Please!

2385
02:29:21,625 --> 02:29:23,500
Were you planning
to present the end card to me?

2386
02:29:23,666 --> 02:29:26,833
I am about to present the end card
to both of you now.

2387
02:29:27,208 --> 02:29:28,166
Brother!

2388
02:29:28,458 --> 02:29:30,791
If your sister boards a ship in this port,

2389
02:29:30,875 --> 02:29:33,750
no one knows which country she will go to
or who she will live with.

2390
02:29:35,250 --> 02:29:36,083
Brother!

2391
02:29:42,791 --> 02:29:43,625
Mahaa!

2392
02:30:24,333 --> 02:30:25,166
Hey!

2393
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:27,208
Once this car reaches
the other side of the road,

2394
02:30:27,291 --> 02:30:29,000
not only you,

2395
02:30:29,208 --> 02:30:31,166
no one can save your sister!

2396
02:30:32,041 --> 02:30:32,916
Look…

2397
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,708
She's leaving. Look.
Are you going to save her?

2398
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:37,500
Will you save her, or will Mother Kali?

2399
02:30:41,375 --> 02:30:43,416
Hail Mother Kali!

2400
02:30:43,791 --> 02:30:45,791
Hail Mother Kali!

2401
02:30:46,166 --> 02:30:48,083
Hail Mother Kali!

2402
02:30:48,541 --> 02:30:50,541
Hail Mother Kali!

2403
02:30:52,083 --> 02:30:53,000
Finish him!

2404
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:05,125
Bhola…

2405
02:31:07,583 --> 02:31:10,208

{\an8}The women trafficking mafia is finished.

2429
02:34:35,458 --> 02:34:36,833
We found the largest database.
