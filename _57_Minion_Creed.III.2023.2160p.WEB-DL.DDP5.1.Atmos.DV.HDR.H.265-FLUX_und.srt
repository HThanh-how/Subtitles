1
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,958
Adonis?

2
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,667
Thought you got scared.

3
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,965
About to roll without you.

4
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:41,901
Come on, bro.

5
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:43,870
Aight.

6
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:37,088
Hey, yo, Adonis. This way.

7
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:53,412
Hey, yo,
H should be expecting us.

8
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,946
- Here we go.
It's showtime.
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,557
Hold up. Shh, shh.

10
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,399
About time, young gun.
Back there.

11
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,631
For sure.

12
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,869
- Dame.
- What's the deal, man?

13
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:24,234
-What, you got me next?
-I got you, champ.

14
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,411
My guy.

15
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,141
-Hey, Dame.
-What's up?

16
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,780
-Who's your friend?
-My name's Donnie.

17
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:33,584
Nice to meet you.
How y'all doing today?

18
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,554
Boy, come on, man.
Come on. Focus up, man.

19
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,017
We got plenty of time
for that.

20
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,394
Trust.

21
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,333
Ooh. Hello, pot.
Man, you see that ring?

22
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:47,895
That's easy money.

23
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,127
And I ain't even tell you
who you've got yet.

24
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:50,799
Come on.

25
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,032
Let's get it.

26
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,639
Michael Fitzbaum.

27
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,576
Orthodox. Solid fighter.

28
00:03:58,578 --> 00:04:00,479
Say he gonna be the first cat
to knock you out.

29
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,583
Hey, but he do got a good jab.

30
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,321
He overreaches though.

31
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,851
He tore his labrum last year
playing football
for Pali, so...

32
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,622
-Make him miss.
-Yeah.

33
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:12,656
The right gonna be open.

34
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:14,218
Aight.

35
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,199
On you?

36
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,343
Come on, man.

37
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,509
Yeah.

38
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,237
See you out there.

39
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:43,148
First round knockout. Damian.

40
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,018
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's fighters

41
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,317
for the regional
Golden Gloves title.

42
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,959
6'2'',

California,

43
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:56,029
-Michael Fitzbaum.

44
00:04:56,031 --> 00:05:01,034
6'1'', fighting out of
the Crenshaw District
of Los Angeles,

45
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:05,478
-"Diamond" Dame Anderson.
- Come on, Dame!
Let's go.

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
- Yeah.

47
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,614
Yeah!

48
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,684
-Fight.

49
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,521
Show him
what you're made of, boy.

50
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,217
Watch the right.

51
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,658
Hey, watch that jab.

52
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,728
Hey, be patient. Be patient.

53
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,259
Keep that guard up, bro.

54
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:31,966
Wait for it.
It's gonna come to you.

55
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:36,872
Watch this. Checkmate.

56
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,684
-Oh, my God! Come on!

57
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:49,346
And the winner,
by way of knockout,

58
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,250
-new Golden Gloves champion...
-What'd I say, boy?
That's how I do.

59
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,286
..."Diamond" Dame Anderson!

60
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,320
Yeah.

61
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:59,356
Let's get it, boy.

62
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,127
Let's get it, man.
What did I tell you, huh?

63
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,602
What'd I tell you?
I sat that boy down.

64
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,363
That straight right,
it's clean.
That's the perfect punch.

65
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,971
Bro, but when
you put him to sleep, though,
everybody was--

66
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,478
-What?

He was over there like--

67
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,208
Man, the first thing
I'ma do, man--

68
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,375
The first thing I'ma do,

69
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,949
I'ma get me
one of them big-ass diamonds.

70
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,720
-Hey.

71
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,491
I'ma get you one too,
little homey.

72
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:26,251
Hey.

73
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,319
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,288
-Appreciate you.
- No doubt, man.

75
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,828
-For real.
-No doubt.

76
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,127
You know, actually,
I got you something too.

77
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,437
It belonged to my pops.

78
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,068
It's original.

79
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,970
Rumble in the Jungle?

80
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,170
Yeah.

81
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,209
Yeah.

82
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,780
I'ma get there one day.

83
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,376
Yeah, I'ma get there.

84
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,313
I'ma win nationals,

85
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,789
taking home
the gold at the Olympics,

86
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,186
and then I'm turning pro.

87
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,190
Don't trip.
You'll be right there with me.

88
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,666
Shit, someone gotta
carry my bags.

89
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,229
-Bro, why you gotta
play with me like that, bro?

90
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,003
I already know
what I want. What you getting?

91
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,544
- Cherry pie, apple pie.
- Cherry pie?

92
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,645
-Got you. Chili cheese fries?
-Yeah, come on.

93
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,339
-Pineapple soda?
-All that.

94
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,649
All on you, boy. Big money.

95
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,819
Leon?

96
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,381
Huh?

97
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,186
Don't remember me, do you?

98
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,221
Am I supposed to remember you?

99
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,497
-Not so little anymore.

100
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:39,698
My name's Donnie.
You remember me now?

101
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,804
We're live, round one,
Cape Town, South Africa,

102
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:49,136
as Adonis Creed
battles his old rival

103
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,677
in what Creed has said
will be his final fight.

104
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,306
Todd Grisham
alongside the champion,
Jessica McCaskill.

105
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,474
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.

106
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,477
Is Conlan looking this good
or Creed looking this bad?

107
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,380
If he doesn't
do something fast,

108
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,085
he's going to end
his historic career

109
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,823
with another loss to Conlan.

110
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:07,253
-There we go.
-Put that jab in his face.

111
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,730
Okay. Same Creed.
Ain't nothing changed.

112
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,393
Conlan stalking his prey,

113
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,329
pushing Creed
towards the corner.

114
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,264
You've got to wonder

115
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,473
if the moment
is getting to Creed here.

116
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,502
Conlan is banging away
with the right hand.

117
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,339
Look to your right.

118
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,747
Seems to be
the same combination

119
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,617
he's throwing over and over,
and Creed can't stop it.

120
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,053
Creed,
getting out of the corner.

121
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,892
Good jab,
but Conlan not fazed at all.

122
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,060
Keep that in his face.
Keep that jab out there.

123
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,359
- Big left
from Conlan.
-Get off that rope.

124
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,966
Oh, he's got him on the ropes.
Clean shots landing.

125
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,572
Creed taking quite a beating.

126
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,071
-And wow.
Conlan almost had him.

127
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:59,140
Next round's
gonna hurt, champ.
Next round's gonna hurt.

128
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,912
You okay, Donnie?

129
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,244
Come on, Donnie.
You gotta work, baby.

130
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,950
Yo,
what you smiling for, dawg?

131
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:09,150
He over there
beating you worse
than last time.

132
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:11,053
Like, is something I miss
that's funny?

133
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:14,122
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

134
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:17,554
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?

135
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,325
I ain't never been scared
of a little contact.

136
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,669
I'm going out how I came in.

137
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:25,496
Man, you're crazy, all right.

138
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:29,940
-How you feeling?
Looking great.
- I'm just warming up.

139
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,140
He had a good run.

140
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:33,504
But it's time
to take back what's ours.

141
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,830
Creed's had
a remarkable career,

142
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:54,360
but you wonder if Father Time
has finally caught up
with the champ.

143
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,966
This is getting dangerous
for Creed.

144
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,003
Ooh, the champ
finally lands one.

145
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,973
Come on, Donnie. Work this.
Show him who's champ.

146
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,008
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.

147
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,042
One more time.

148
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,831
And down goes Conlan!
He goes down!

149
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,526
What a moment!
And I don't think
he's gonna get up, Jessica.

150
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:32,332
Three, four, five,

151
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,367
six, seven,

152
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,566
eight,

153
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,238
nine,

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,371
ten.

155
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:39,339
Yeah!

156
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:40,538
And that's it, folks.

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,748
-It's over.

158
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,179
What a chess move
from Adonis Creed.

159
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,312
Just incredible.

160
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:47,149
What a turn. What an ending.

161
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:50,383
That's how you go out.

162
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,726
Who would expect anything less
from Adonis Creed

163
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,828
as he takes his final bow
on the world stage?

164
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,027
What an exit.

165
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,194
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.

166
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:02,395
And that means
we've got a new, undisputed

167
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:03,902
heavyweight champion
of the world

168
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,102
for the first time
in two decades,

169
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:08,269
and his name is Adonis Creed.

170
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,833
Okay, okay, okay.

171
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,106
Yes. All right.

172
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:50,877

-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

179
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:07,619
This the track you've been
working on for Kehlani?

180
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,994
-Yeah.
-Okay.

181
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,820
We had a good session,
but I don't know.

182
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,789
What you mean you don't know?
Can you send this to me?

183
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,527
-Yes, yes.
-I need this in the car.

184
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,001
How was today?

185
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,629
-It was good. Yeah.
-Yeah?

186
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,401
-Thank you
for holding it down.
-I got you.

187
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,699
Did you get her to bed?

188
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,041
-I did.
-Mmm.

189
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,735
So, I'm not gonna lie.

190
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,572
I had to bribe her
with about six scoops
of ice cream.

191
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:27,837
I don't even know
how she sleep.

192
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,916
Retirement made you soft,
you know that?

193
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,808
I can't tell that girl no.

194
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,151
I think you had
a couple scoops too
'cause look, you got this.

195
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,218
-Mmm.
-Uh-huh.

196
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,747
-Yeah, that's bad.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,452
Take that off
before it stains, D.

198
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,323
Oh, I see
what you're trying to do.

199
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,753
What's that?

200
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,997
You're trying to get me naked.

201
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,263
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely
not trying to do that
'cause I'm trying to work.

202
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,528
I see what you were
trying to do.

203
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,695
No, you can just own it.
It's okay.

204
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,037
I know you just wanna
see all this.

205
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,533
- No, no, no.
-Look at that.

206
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,600
No.

207
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,405
-Still hot? Still warm?

208
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,407
-Stop it.
I'm working, D. Please.

209
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,211
I'm working too.
Listen,
I don't get a chance to--

210
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,444
What are you working on?

211
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,842
I don't get no alone time
with you no more
'cause you be hard at work.

212
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,953
I know. Yeah.

213
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:08,779
-You ain't got no time for me.
-I know.

214
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,517
You ain't got time for--

215
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,849
-I know,
but I don't have time now.
-So come on. You don't?

216
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,653
- No. No.
-Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

217
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:18,822
-Mmm.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

218
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:21,891
Don't you miss when...

219
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:25,598
we used to...
...anywhere.

220
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,897
-Any place?
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,976
Mm-mmm. Okay.

222
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:31,241
Okay, let's go.

223
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,309
Okay, I just-- I have, like,
about 15 minutes

224
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,278
-because I have to send
these stems.
-Fifteen.

225
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,642
How about 12?

226
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,083
All right.
Twelve will do.

227
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,926
<i>Next stop, Leimert Park.</i>

228
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,677
Body, head. Body, head.

229
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,120
Efficiency over power, baby.
Give it to him.

230
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:20,818
Technique. Technique, Felix.

231
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,359
You can't just punch
your way through Drago.

232
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,527
We got a plan, so stick to it.

233
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,661
-Come on.
Make him work for it.
- Let's go.

234
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,169
It's not only about power.
It's timing, speed.

235
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,534
-Shit, you're telling me?
Come on now.
-I know, I know.

236
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,931
Keep drilling into him.

237
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,109
Technique. Technique.

238
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,275
-Time.

239
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,178
Hey! Time!

240
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,509
Felix. Get over here.

241
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,052
These guys are trash.

242
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:48,054
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.

243
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,551
It's hard.
You've chewed through
most of LA.

244
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,158
You want me to pull back?
You know Drago
ain't taking it easy.

245
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,827
Hey, Felix.
<i>Ven aqui.</i>

246
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,071
What's up, champ?
You wanna help me
with some rounds?

247
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,535
What, and mess up this suit?
I don't think so.

248
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,735
I'm trying
to get you paid, Felix.

249
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,374
We can't get you paid
if you keep knocking out

250
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,969
all these sparring partners,
okay?

251
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,147
You gotta be ready
to fight Drago in four weeks.

252
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,413
You're the champ.
We know you got power.

253
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,547
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.

254
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,879
-It's about control and focus.
-You're right.

255
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:22,913
Listen to Duke.

256
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,092
Yes, sir.

257
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:29,018
See? You play too much.

258
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,558
-Listen to Duke.
- Did you hear that?

259
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,593
"Listen to Duke."

260
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,431
Those three words.
Not "I love you."

261
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,994
Not "take it easy."
None of that.

262
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,930
"Listen to Duke."

263
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,570
I understand
exactly what they're asking.

264
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:46,112
Drago's got a bigger name,
that's true,
but Felix got the belt.

265
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,576
His split's got to be bigger.

266
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:50,776
I don't care
if they don't like it.
Tell Drago to call me.

267
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,252
Hey,
let me call you right back.

268
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,781
Hey, my man.

269
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,455
Can I help you?

270
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:02,227
-Let me get an autograph.
-No, I ain't signing
no autographs.

271
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,228
Would you get off my car?

272
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,990
Oh, homey.

273
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,828
You don't remember me, huh?

274
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,965
You come a long way
from bumming rides
from your mom.

275
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,870
Dame.

276
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,411
- Boy, you had me.

277
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,040
Damian.

278
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,646
Yeah, just got back
to the hood.

279
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,648
Stopped by the old gym,
but, uh...

280
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,288
Yeah, we upgraded
a couple years ago, you know?

281
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,157
I see.

282
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,624
-Damn, it's, uh...
-It's been a minute.

283
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,824
Been a minute.

284
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:43,730
Hey, I don't wanna take up
your time or nothing, man.

285
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,435
I just wanted to let you know
what's good.

286
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:47,063
I'm around.

287
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,834
If you wanna catch up,
you know,
you just let me know.

288
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,184
Where you about to head now?

289
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,221
Shit, back to the crib.

290
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,850
You got time to get some grub?

291
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,523
Thank you.

292
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:09,492
-Thank you.
- Enjoy.

293
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm surprised
you still come here
and eat with the common folk.

294
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,507
I mean, when I can.

295
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,872
There's a lot of things
I used to do
that I can't do anymore.

296
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,544
Busy living
that high life, huh?

297
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:30,249
Yeah.
Guess it comes with the job.

298
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,450
All right.

299
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:35,881
Yo-- Easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

300
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:37,520
You know how long it's been
since I had this shit?

301
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,424
How long?

302
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:42,327
Eighteen years, bro.

303
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,327
You've been down
this whole time?

304
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:51,534
Had a few years tacked on,
but... yeah.

305
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,065
Just got out last week.

306
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,541
Well, congratulations on that.

307
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:01,511
Thank you.

308
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,547
Wrote you a few times.

309
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,683
-You did?
Where'd you send 'em?
-Mama Creed's.

310
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,084
She still up in Bel Air?

311
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,525
Yeah, she's still there.
Same house.

312
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:17,560
But I never got 'em.

313
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:28,197
You know I watched
every one of your fights
in the pen.

314
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,770
You finally
made it to Africa, huh?

315
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:33,202
-You seen that?
-Saw that.

316
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:36,612
Made me proud
how you ended your run.

317
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:38,944
Look like you still remember
some of them moves
I taught you.

318
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:42,981
You know what I remember?

319
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,424
You knocking my ass out.

320
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,056
You know what I remember?

321
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,125
Helping your big ass back up.

322
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,160
Remember that?

323
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:00,966
-Yeah, you did.
-All right, then.

324
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,006
You got work?

325
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,813
I got plans.

326
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,817
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my PO off my ass.

327
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:17,851
Mm.

328
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:25,562
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,

329
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:28,961
if I can help at all,
just ask.

330
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,603
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

331
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,808
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.

332
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:46,946
I'm straight, bro.

333
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,113
I'm good.
I got it all situated.

334
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,181
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.

335
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,688
Nah, I didn't mean it
like that. It was...

336
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:55,658
Respect.

337
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,093
So, what's the plan?

338
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,369
Same program
last time you saw me.

339
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,197
I wanna be champ.

340
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,302
You still wanna box?

341
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,139
Hey, I know I've been
away a long time.

342
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,879
I kept myself in shape.

343
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,618
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.

344
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,685
Yeah. You...

345
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:26,183
-You looking diesel.
-I ain't joking.

346
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:28,185
I'm ready.

347
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,726
I still got gas in the tank.

348
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,861
And I gotta get me that chain.

349
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,227
Can't be "Diamond" Dame
looking bummy.

350
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,197
-"Diamond" Dame.

351
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:42,540
That's right.

352
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,076
All right.

353
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,111
Come by the gym.

354
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,080
Get you set up with Duke.

355
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:00,921
-For real?
-Yeah.

356
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:03,462
For real.

357
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:06,632
All right, then.

358
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,535
Thank you.

359
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,721
Yo, yo, yo!

360
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,030
-What's so funny?

361
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:46,538
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to convince your mama
to come live with us,

362
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,969
so I can have
my own live-in braider.

363
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,447
Yeah.
Careful what you wish for.

364
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:55,778
-Oh, I'm not worried.

365
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,815
It's actually not a bad idea.

366
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:01,982
And how you feeling, Mama?
You good?

367
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,457
I'm good.

368
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:06,558
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

369
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,120
Okay.

370
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:10,826
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

371
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:15,424
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

372
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,129
-Mmm.
-I just got caught up.

373
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,196
Mm-hmm.

374
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:53,330
You're gonna have
your hands full with that one.

375
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,838
We already do.

376
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,676
-No. She's the best.
-Yes, we do.

377
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,546
She is.

378
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,438
-You're the worst.
-Oh, come on, Mama.

379
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,682
-You're the worst.
- Stop...
You don't mean it.

380
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:07,179
-Here, Ma.
-Thank you.

381
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,984
B, think that's a good idea?

382
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:11,557
Baby, not tonight.

383
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,020
But we talked
about this.

384
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:15,055
- One thing at a time.
- Okay.

385
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,998
Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?

386
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,769
And just so we're straight

387
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:29,201
and everybody knows,

388
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,708
I am not leaving my house.

389
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,842
Understood?

390
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,470
Mm-hmm.

391
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,044
- Okay.
- Okay.

392
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:38,848
And I really am fine.

393
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,510
I promise you,
I am not gonna have
another stroke tonight.

394
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:42,280
Okay?

395
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,316
Have it tomorrow night.

396
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,890
-Mom. That's...

397
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:49,155
That's not funny.

398
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,519
It's a little funny.

399
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,389
And you're not helping.

400
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,666
You know
that we're worried about you.

401
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,063
-That's it.
We can leave it now.
-I...

402
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:57,801
And we wanna be careful
after the last one.

403
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,737
I am fine.

404
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:01,431
Okay?

405
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,502
But what about you?

406
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,745
What's up with you?

407
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:09,439
Yeah. Where were you, D?

408
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,310
Just ran into
this guy named Dame.

409
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,752
Damian.

410
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,723
Who's he?

411
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,325
Think you might've
checked with me?
This ain't no damn charity.

412
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,296
And homey older than you.

413
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,068
I'm just trying
to give him a break.
Isn't that what we do anyway?

414
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,741
No! This ain't the YMCA.

415
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,303
Look around, Duke.

416
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,942
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?

417
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,781
All I'm saying is,
let him spar.

418
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:47,213
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.

419
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,380
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring
with Felix.

420
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,590
I know what you doin', Donnie.

421
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,758
You don't owe this dude shit.

422
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,519
Nothing.

423
00:25:58,457 --> 00:25:59,357
But let's spar.

424
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,359
Let's do it.

425
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,001
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

426
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:07,530
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.

427
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:10,940
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

428
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,679
-Huh?
-We on.

429
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,720
Lot of young cats in here.

430
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:23,986
Young man's game.

431
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:26,956
Don't worry,
Duke's gonna take care of you.

432
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:30,762
We back to ground zero.

433
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:32,390
Champs gotta start somewhere,
right?

434
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:41,003
All right.

435
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:44,974
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

436
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,570
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?

437
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:51,277
You got this.

438
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,214
Felix, stay focused.
Work on timing.
That's all we need.

439
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:16,269
Well, I'm just asking.

440
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:49,599
Mm-hmm.

441
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:07,892
So, you wanna
teach her how to fight?
That's your advice?

442
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,092
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

443
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,556
-but maybe I was wrong.
-Wait.

444
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,428
What does that mean,
"at a deaf school like that,"
like they're not still kids?

445
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,100
I mean,
what did you expect, Adonis?

446
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:19,805
Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

447
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,301
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that

448
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:22,874
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

449
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,469
I'm just saying
what that means to me

450
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:26,141
is different
than what it means to you.

451
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:29,947
What if she's someplace
she's supposed to be safe,
and she's not?

452
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,476
She won't know
how to protect herself.

453
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:33,643
Where's that coming from?

454
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:37,680
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

455
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:40,826
Okay.

456
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:42,894
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

457
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:44,291
it's actually
our responsibility

458
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:46,458
to teach her
how to assess her emotions.

459
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,494
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

460
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,331
and start talking
about her feelings?

461
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,464
That's not real life.

462
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,169
Okay, what do you
want her to do?

463
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:56,138
You want her
to never talk about
her feelings to anyone?

464
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,912
Not even to us,
and all she can do
about them is to hit somebody?

465
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,914
Look,
I know that you think that
that has worked for you,

466
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,773
but now that you don't have
an outlet anymore,

467
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,281
you should think about
maybe talking
about how you feel.

468
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:09,448
If not to me, to somebody.

469
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,186
Or, I don't know, D.
Get a hobby.

470
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,090
-Okay, I'll get a hobby.
-Oh, yeah?

471
00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:16,125
Yeah, you.

472
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,094
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start
laying tracks with you.

473
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:21,130
That's not funny, D.

474
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:24,298
Look,
I know that you think that
you are protecting her, baby,

475
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,203
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,
not just how to do it.

476
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,667
And the only solution
to every problem
is not a punch in the face.

477
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,801
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.

478
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,511
All right,
let's just have a good time.

479
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,153
Okay,
I see you made it all right.

480
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:46,782
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"Where the Black family
live at?"

481
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:50,027
-I'm kidding.
-Yeah.

482
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,292
-What's up, man?
-'Sup?

483
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:53,393
There's other ones around.

484
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:54,999
I ain't see none. Here you go.

485
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,462
Thank you.

486
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,332
-Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
-Pleasure.

487
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,796
-You never bought me
no flowers.
-What, you want a kiss?

488
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,568
-Nah. I'm okay.
No, no, it's all right.
-Come here.

489
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,702
-Hey, y'all got
a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

490
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:10,707
You got
the see-through floors?

491
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,545
Oh.

492
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,779
Whoa. All right.

493
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,957
Amara.

494
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:21,751
-Amara?
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,788
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

496
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:29,363
Nice to meet you.

497
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,531
She says, "You too."

498
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:33,565
Ah, hell yeah.

499
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:40,704
Thank you again.

500
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,214
Dawg,
I still can't get over this.

501
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,678
This square
got him a whole mansion.

502
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,615
Married a--
a genuine rock star.

503
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:51,990
-Yeah, I did.
-Mmm.

504
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,290
How many gold records you got?

505
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,226
-I have a few.
- She bein' modest.

506
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:59,228
She bein' real modest.

507
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,891
No, but it's mostly
artists I produce,
but, yeah, I got some.

508
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:05,399
-And she produces?
-She does.

509
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,732
Donnie. You punching up.

510
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,537
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?

511
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,078
I don't really
perform like that these days.

512
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,311
Yeah, I took a break,
'cause I was...

513
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:19,314
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

514
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:21,712
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve
what I've got left,

515
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,022
so, I'm producing.

516
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,992
Yeah.

517
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:28,620
Not any time soon.

518
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,922
Still hard
to give that part up, though.
Right?

519
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:37,563
Yeah. It's not
the only thing I love,
but it takes work.

520
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,070
It's an adjustment...
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:40,269
...for the both of us.

522
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:43,338
So, how long
have you known each other?

523
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,670
- I mean...
-We go back. Way back.

524
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:49,839
We was like...
We was like brothers.

525
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,775
Shared a room for two years
at the Jeff.

526
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,317
Yeah, something like that.

527
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,451
You know how it went.
He went off
and got all Hollywood.

528
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:58,848
The Jeff, right.

529
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,025
Yeah, the group home.

530
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,292
You remember them bedbugs?

531
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,691
I try to forget 'em.

532
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:07,890
Yeah.

533
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,562
I can't forget them bugs.

534
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:16,767
-I'm gonna get her to bed.
- Okay.

535
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,506
-You two stay, catch up.
- Okay.

536
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,508
Oh, invite him
to the label party.

537
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,938
-Definitely will do that.
-Yeah.

538
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,149
I heard that. I'm invited
to the label party.

539
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:27,679
-You're invited.
- Thank you.

540
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:30,121
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.

541
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:33,322
-Yeah, no doubt.
My pleasure to meet you.
-Mmm.

542
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:44,564
I can't believe
you moved back out here
to the boonies.

543
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:46,896
You used to love
coming out to the hood.
Now you all...

544
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,997
What?

545
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,142
-Domesticated and shit.
-Ah, come on, man.

546
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:53,210
-See what happens
when you get married.

547
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,047
-Yeah, all right, bro.
-Aight?

548
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:57,346
-The women run this household.
I just live here.

549
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,614
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

550
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,385
It's crazy.

551
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:07,521
Pour up.

552
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,964
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.

553
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:26,969
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.

554
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:37,045
You saying that
like I got soft
or something, like...

555
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,047
-Like I lost this
sneak-attack.
-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

556
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:41,357
Okay, I see.
The champ's still got
some pepper in him.

557
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,129
All I'm saying is,
I left boxing,
but boxing didn't leave me.

558
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,462
See,
that's what I'm saying, bro.

559
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,028
I mean, look,
I know you got a ship to run,
and whatnot,

560
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,370
but I ain't keep
my stuff together

561
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:55,998
just to be some punching bag
for some chump.

562
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,934
You feel me?

563
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,079
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

564
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,280
He got it the hard way.
He earned it.

565
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:06,448
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.

566
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,487
Maybe I ain't
make myself clear.

567
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,019
I want a title shot.

568
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:19,989
Dame...

569
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,431
I don't know
what you think,
but it don't work like that.

570
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:25,467
Felix so cold,
what he got to lose?
What you got to lose?

571
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,667
You think I can snap
my fingers and make you
a contender overnight?

572
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:28,932
Ain't that
what happened to you?

573
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:39,679
It's like this, bro.

574
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:43,386
I respect you...

575
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:47,654
but my clock tickin'.

576
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:50,261
It's now or never for me.

577
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,956
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.

578
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:56,630
But, man,
what you asking me, it's...

579
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,633
it's kinda impossible.

580
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,969
You don't know
what it's like, bro.

581
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,006
All that time in them...

582
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:12,976
in them walls.

583
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,081
Impossible?

584
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,052
They take your name.

585
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,230
And they give you a number.

586
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,091
That's how it start.

587
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:33,733
I was the best, though.

588
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:35,504
Yeah, you were.

589
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:37,440
I was, bro.

590
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,938
But I never got a chance
to prove that.

591
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:45,514
Look,
all I'm saying, bro, if--

592
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:49,749
If Apollo Creed
could take a chance
on some underdog...

593
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:52,554
why can't you?

594
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,733
Did you sleep okay?

595
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,605
Mm-hmm.

596
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,969
You were
grinding your teeth.

597
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,138
How was the rest
of last night?

598
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,844
Mm...

599
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:21,682
-It was, uh... It was good.
-Yeah?

600
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:22,947
Just catching up.

601
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,226
Hey,
why didn't you ever tell me
about the group home?

602
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,924
There wasn't a lot to say.

603
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:36,763
Hmm.

604
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,930
How old were you?

605
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,968
Uh, I was around Amara's age.

606
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,446
You don't wanna talk about it?

607
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,174
It's okay.

608
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,145
-No.
-It's okay.

609
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,115
Nah, it's Dame.

610
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,525
You know he asked me
to fight Felix?

611
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:06,221
-For real?
-Yeah.

612
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,026
Heavyweight champion
of the world,
and he wants a shot.

613
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,632
So what'd you say?

614
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,338
I said no.

615
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,571
It's impossible, you know?

616
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:17,639
People wait their whole lives
for a shot like that.

617
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,168
-And he's not even a pro.
-Yeah.

618
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,678
Why does it look like
you're still considering it?

619
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:30,520
Right. All right.
Work him against the ropes.

620
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:33,050
Work him.
Stay in front of him, baby.
Cut off that ring. Come on.

621
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,284
-Oof.

622
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:37,659
That's right.

623
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:41,696
Don't look at me, man.
You on your own in there.
Let's go.

624
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,192
Come on,<i> mijo,</i> stay on him.

625
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,501
Keep fighting. Let's go.

626
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:46,162
Okay.

627
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:50,001
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.

628
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:51,035
Okay.

629
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,509
Let's go, grandpa.

630
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:54,577
Not enough.

631
00:37:57,681 --> 00:37:59,208
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.

632
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:02,277
Give it to him.

633
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,015
Work yourself out the clinch.
Let's do it.

634
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,151
-Hey! You keep it clean, huh?
-What was that? Hey.

635
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,956
Yo, man.
What you trying to do,
hurt me?

636
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:14,465
-Walk it off. Little man,
you ain't built like that.
-Who you calling "little man"?

637
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,664
This is my gym, bro.

638
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,863
All right, coz. All right!

639
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:18,326
Get in there.

640
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:19,063
Hey, hey, hey.

641
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:22,902
Nah.
Get back, Damian. Let him go.

642
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,871
Hey!
What's going on down here?

643
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:26,037
That was intentional.

644
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,204
-You handle this.
-I am gonna handle this.

645
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,645
D, talk to me. What happened?

646
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:30,712
Me doing my job.

647
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:32,747
Hey, come here, man.

648
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:35,552
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Use your head. Okay?

649
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:37,081
Use your head. Leave all that
other mess outside.

650
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:40,249
I told you what I want, D.

651
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:42,922
And I told you
it was gonna take some time.

652
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:43,956
All right.

653
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:46,926
All right? Go take a walk.

654
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:48,433
Get some air.

655
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,094
Aight?

656
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:52,899
Hey, Adonis.

657
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:54,263
No-- Hey, Duke. Calm down.

658
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,572
-This was a mistake.
-I got it under control.

659
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:56,870
I told you right away
it was a mistake.

660
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:59,103
-I got it.
-You don't!

661
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:01,105
You let him come in here
with a chip on his shoulder.

662
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,513
That's exactly...

663
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:04,746
-Well,
don't get quiet now, Dukie.
-Man...

664
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:09,311
It's okay.
Relax. I know, I got you.
I know. Just let it go. Okay?

665
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,248
I got it under control.

666
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:15,460
He's telling you
who he is, right?

667
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,220
Believe him.

'Sup, Donnie?

681
00:42:59,983 --> 00:43:01,114
I would've had you.

682
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,953
Okay, maybe not.

683
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,383
Okay, maybe not.

684
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:11,619
-You look all right.
-You know. You too.

685
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,489
-A sweater.
-I'm... just glad you came.

686
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:16,668
B invited.

687
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,834
True.

688
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:21,739
Hey, don't worry about them.

689
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:23,499
I ain't.

690
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,776
It's a party. Have fun.

691
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:27,712
So many other things in here
you should be looking at.

692
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,376
It's a fire party, bro. Yeah.

693
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,917
Congrats, boy.

694
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:38,646
You made it.

695
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:41,220
Now those two: Chavez, Drago.

696
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:43,189
I'm gonna make sure
that's the fight of the year.

697
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,060
Hey, you okay?

698
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:49,360
I don't need
no babysitting, bro.

699
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:51,802
Aight. I'ma be right back.

700
00:43:51,804 --> 00:43:52,836
Go ahead.

701
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,367
Look at my two killers.

702
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,775
I can't wait
to get this thing...

703
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,242
Are you ready to do this?

704
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:05,013
You know I'm always ready.
You don't have to ask.

705
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:06,916
Okay. Save it for fight night.

706
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:10,381
We got the venue.
We got the money.
We're gonna break records.

707
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:12,251
Will you send me
the tracks, please?

708
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:13,725
I can't wait to hear them.

709
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,188
We'll talk next week.
It was so nice to meet you.

710
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,519
Congratulations too.

711
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,422
You made it.

712
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,930
-Yep.
-Thank you for coming.

713
00:44:20,932 --> 00:44:22,096
You having fun?

714
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,230
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

715
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:26,067
-Yeah.
-Good. Me too.

716
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:28,267
I'm tired of
working the room, but...

717
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,774
It's what you do.

718
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,875
Yeah, sometimes.

719
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,602
-Guess that's what y'all do.
Look at him over there.

720
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,208
Getting his Don King on.

721
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,847
Minus the hair.

722
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,277
-Thank God.
- Yeah.

723
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,707
You know,
that's growth for him.

724
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,610
He used to hate
coming to these things.

725
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:43,788
So...

726
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,517
-How does it feel?
-What's that?

727
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,793
Having somebody else
sing your song?

728
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:49,827
Mmm.

729
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,720
It feels good.

730
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,558
I mean,
if it's gotta be anybody,
not bad.

731
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,967
Yeah, I almost believe you.

732
00:45:01,104 --> 00:45:03,302
How about Donnie?
Think he misses boxing?

733
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:05,909
No. Not that he tells me.

734
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,670
But would he?

735
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:15,479
Speaking of,
you know, there's something
I wanted to ask you actually.

736
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:18,647
Curious what happened
with you two.

737
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:21,793
Oh, you wanna know
how I got locked up.

738
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:23,619
Yeah.

739
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,060
Boring story really.

740
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,358
Got into a fight.

741
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:29,163
I had a few priors.

742
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,264
Pulled a gun.

743
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,630
Donnie was there.
He can tell you.

744
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:36,137
You know.

745
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:37,468
Donnie pop off...

746
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:42,605
And I ain't even saying
dude ain't deserve it, but...

747
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:44,541
Who is "dude"?

748
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:51,790
-Okay. Uh...

749
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:54,650
His name was Leon.

750
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,687
The rest of it,
we gonna leave
to Donnie to tell you.

751
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:01,525
Ain't really my place.
Feel me?

752
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:04,935
But it's like you say.

753
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:07,366
You know, it take work
to look at the past.

754
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,005
- Yo, stop him.
- Drago!

755
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,766
Hey, hey, get that guy!

756
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:19,147
<i>The LAPD took this man,</i>
<i>Luis Camino, into custody...</i>

757
00:46:19,149 --> 00:46:21,314
No.

758
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:23,514
No, we're not
canceling anything.

759
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:25,186
He's seeing a specialist
right now.

760
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:29,553
They're saying...
at least six months.

761
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:31,192
I know. I know.
But we'll figure it out.

762
00:46:31,194 --> 00:46:32,556
Do not move the date.

763
00:46:33,526 --> 00:46:34,690
All right. All right. Bye.

764
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,197
<i>...high-profile event.</i>

765
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,727
<i>Drago, who's currently</i>
<i>recovering at Cedars-Sinai,</i>

766
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,663
<i>suffered a concussion,</i>

767
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,237
<i>as well as multiple fractures</i>
<i>to his right arm and hand.</i>

768
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,800
<i>And his injuries</i>
<i>now throw into doubt</i>

769
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,571
<i>his participation</i>
<i>in next month's...</i>

770
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:49,980
<i>...highly-anticipated</i>
<i>title fight</i>

771
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:51,641
<i>-against Felix Chavez.</i>
-Hello?

772
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,379
Yes,
everything is gonna be fine.

773
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:55,348
We'll figure it out.
We'll find another fighter.

774
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,812
It's not about just finding
another fighter.

775
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,353
I know, and I understand
your frustrations.
I really do.

776
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:01,354
So, what are you gonna do?

777
00:47:01,356 --> 00:47:03,587
He wants to fight Drago.

778
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:06,425
But we can't wait six months
for him to be cleared.

779
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:09,725
These windows
don't last forever.
We need to get him paid now.

780
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:15,764
All right, there's one,
maybe two other contenders
outside of Drago.

781
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,942
There's Ortiz,
and then there's Sporino.

782
00:47:17,944 --> 00:47:19,944
And he's recovering
from his last fight.

783
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:20,978
Okay, so then who?

784
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:30,053
I got an idea.

785
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,815
It's risky,
but if we pull it off,
it'll be a payday.

786
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,026
What do you have in mind?

787
00:47:36,028 --> 00:47:37,225
He wants you to fight Dame.

788
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:39,029
Dame?

789
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:41,064
He's not even a real fighter.

790
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,429
He was real enough
when he was sparring with you.

791
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:44,595
Hey, Felix, people talk.

792
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:46,795
Champ, he's older than you.

793
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,467
-Huh?
- You're right.

794
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,602
But Dame
will fight tooth and nail.

795
00:47:51,604 --> 00:47:53,439
Right now,
we gotta think
outside the box.

796
00:47:55,608 --> 00:47:57,212
Oh, you don't like it, huh?

797
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:58,906
Damian ain't a boxer.

798
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:00,314
He's fighting the world
and he's trying
to hurt people.

799
00:48:00,316 --> 00:48:02,250
No, I don't like it.
I think it'd be a circus.

800
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:05,880
What he means is
he's gonna put on a show.
Okay?

801
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,882
We gotta play the cards
that we're dealt.

802
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,489
But the thing here is,
will people come?

803
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:13,756
Oh, people are gonna show up.
I can promise you that.

804
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:16,627
Everyone loves
an underdog story.

805
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:21,071
You know
how many people tuned in
when Apollo gave Rocky a shot?

806
00:48:21,073 --> 00:48:23,337
People are still talking
about that fight today.

807
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,109
Champ, listen.

808
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,508
I know it's not
what we promised, okay?
I understand.

809
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,709
But if it was me, I'd do it.

810
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:45,788
Let's do it.

811
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:47,856
Just let your boy know,

812
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,594
I'ma beat his ass
when I'm in that ring.

813
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,136
Felix, all I want you to do
is your job.

814
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,238
-Hmm?
-Let's get it.

815

00:51:43,473 --> 00:51:44,340
How do I look?

862
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:47,068
You look lighter.

863
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:53,844
Thank you.

864
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:54,977
You ain't gotta thank me.

865
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:58,156
Just go out there and put on.

866
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:01,225
For sure.

867
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:21,476
And now,
ladies and gentlemen
in attendance,

868
00:52:21,478 --> 00:52:24,479
and boxing fans joining us
around the world,

869
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:27,075
here we go.

870
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:30,914
The challenger this evening,
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

871
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:33,048
out of
South Central Los Angeles.

872
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:40,891
<i>♪ All my life</i>
<i>Been grindin' all my life ♪</i>

873
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,828
<i>♪ Sacrificed, hustled</i>
<i>Paid the price ♪</i>

874
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,764
<i>♪ Want a slice</i>
<i>Got to roll the dice ♪</i>

875
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:48,701

876
00:52:48,703 --> 00:52:51,033
<i>♪ All my life</i>
<i>Been grindin' all my life ♪</i>

877
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:54,168
What is it about this guy
that's so special

878
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,072
that he gets a title shot
his very first fight?

879
00:52:57,074 --> 00:53:00,284
Well, it all hinges
on Adonis Creed.

880
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:03,518
Creed says Anderson
is more than up to the task.

881
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,950
But we'll find out ourselves
in just a moment.

882
00:53:06,952 --> 00:53:09,821
Will this be a fairy tale
or a massacre?

883
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:56,670
This guy is a true product
of Creed Athletics.

884
00:53:56,672 --> 00:54:00,069
Chavez made his presence felt
when he stormed onto the scene

885
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:03,413
with a string
of devastating knockouts.

886
00:54:03,415 --> 00:54:05,239
A proud fighter,

887
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:08,979
he had one prediction
for this evening's
unlikely main event:

888
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:10,618
Victory.

889
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,587
From the Crypto.com Arena,

890
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:15,986
<i>it's time for the main event</i>
<i>of the evening.</i>

891
00:54:15,988 --> 00:54:17,757
<i>-It's showtime!</i>
-It's okay.

892
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,660
I got it. Thank you.

893
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:22,025
-<i> Introducing</i>
<i>to you first, on my right...</i>
-I'm fine.

894
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:23,829
...making his
professional debut,

895
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:27,162
in an unprecedented attempt
at a world title,

896
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,934
here is the former
Golden Gloves champion,

897
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:35,643
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

898
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:38,877
And his opponent
across the ring

899
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:41,880
is the defending
world champion.

900
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:45,015
With a record
of 15 wins and one loss,

901
00:54:45,017 --> 00:54:48,458
he has 14 wins
coming by way of knockout.

902
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,531
Introducing
Felix "El Guerrero" Chavez.

903
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,897
Center ring. Center ring.

904
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:01,163
Gentlemen,
we went over the rules
in the dressing room.

905
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,506
I wanna remind you
to protect yourself
at all times.

906
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:07,510
Obey my commands.

907
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,841
God bless you both.

908
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:12,680
Touch up.

909
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:23,922
Chavez! Chavez!

910
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:26,320
The bell and the start
of round one,

911
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,696
here at the Crypto.com Arena.

912
00:55:28,698 --> 00:55:31,732
-Chavez starts out aggressive.
On the hunt.

913
00:55:31,734 --> 00:55:35,098
Sending a very clear message
to Anderson
of what he has in store.

914
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,265
But Anderson is keeping
a tight guard.

915
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,302
Come on, champ! Let's go.

916
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:46,681
Don't lay off. Keep that
pressure there, baby.

917
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:48,749
Chavez paws
with that jab there

918
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:50,586
but Anderson's showing
good movement.

919
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:58,957
Whoo!

920
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,434
Chavez walks him down...

921
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:06,129
-Oh, wow!
What an awkward punch.
- Mmm.

922
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:07,768
<i>That looked intentional.</i>

923
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,099
Where all that power go?

924
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:10,133
It ain't nothing. Let's go.

925
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:13,103
Hands up, baby. Hands up.

926
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:14,973
You ain't got nothing
I ain't seen, boy.

927
00:56:14,975 --> 00:56:17,074
Okay, grandpa.
<i>No tienes nada.</i>

928
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:19,582
You soft. You soft.

929
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:26,083
Anderson clinches.

930
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:28,756
Get off the ropes.

931
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:31,418
Before shelling back up
into that crab guard.

932
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,958
Dame may be new to us,

933
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
but he may have
some tricks in his bag.

934
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:41,197
-Come on, ref.
Didn't you see that?
-Box!

935
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:46,807
Some dangerous punches
to end the first.

936
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:49,645
Anderson might need
to freshen up
on the rule book, Al.

937
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:50,646
Let's go, Felix.

938
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:56,113
He thinks he's got you.

939
00:56:57,182 --> 00:56:58,412
Stick to the plan.

940
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,589
-I know what I'm doing.
- Listen,

941
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:00,953
you fight the fighter,
I fight the refs.

942
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,856
Don't let this
turn into no kind of brawl.

943
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:05,661
That's what he wants.
He's trying to agitate you.
No. Okay?

944
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:07,498
- I got this.
- Let's get out there.

945
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,232
You stole that round.
Don't get caught up...

946
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,830
-Water.
-...in their stuff.

947
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:11,865
It's the first round
and you got bruises
on your face.

948
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:14,604
Come on,
you better than that, champ.
Stick to the script, baby.

949
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:16,639
You get out there
and fight the fight
that we worked so hard for.

950
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,471
Round two begins,

951
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:26,649
and Chavez is already
back on the attack.

952
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:30,653
There we go, champ.

953
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,787
Feels like Chavez
is back in the fight.

954
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:42,291
Mamma mia!

955
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:46,702
Anderson swinging to separate
Chavez's head
from his shoulders.

956
00:57:50,873 --> 00:57:53,500
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

957
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:56,140
-Yo! What is this?

Wow, that looked deliberate.

958
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:57,471
-You! Time!
- The ref needs

959
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,308
to get control
before this gets out of hand.

960
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,079
-Can you continue?
-Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

961
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:03,312
-Stay right here.
- The only
good news for Chavez is that

962
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,655
-that cut
is so far below his eye...
-Come here.

963
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:08,020
-...but it's still dangerous.
-Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.

964
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:09,153
It's about time, ref.

965
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:11,562
Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.

966
00:58:11,564 --> 00:58:14,257
Listen, you keep this up
and you're gonna
get yourself disqualified.

967
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:15,665
-Do you understand?
-Right. Right.

968
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:16,930
-Stay right there.

969
00:58:16,932 --> 00:58:18,932
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

970
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:20,230
If anyone was wondering...
-Box!

971
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:22,837
...what kind of fight
this would be,

972
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:26,236
it seems like
Anderson is out
to make this clear:

973
00:58:26,238 --> 00:58:30,108
This is a fight for your life.

974
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,848
Let's hope Chavez can make it
back to his corner and adjust.

975
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,048
Big right hand
to end the round

976
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:40,283
and Chavez
sends Anderson to the corner
with something to think about.

977
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:42,153
Way to finish.
Way to finish strong.

978
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:48,390
Let me get that mouthpiece.

979
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:56,134
Keep grinding, champ.
Round after round.

980
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,142
Hey, champ.
You good? Can you still go?

981
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,375
Yeah, I'm good.

982
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,585
Okay, he's good. Let's go.

983
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:10,115
He said he's good.

984
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:14,086
Listen, pain is temporary.

985
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:16,319
-Say it back to me.
Pain is temporary.
-Pain is temporary.

986
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:18,827
He a bum! Okay?
And you the champ, right?

987
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:20,763
I'm the champ.

988
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,995
Let's go, champ.
Keep your hands up.
Stay off them ropes.

989
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:27,935
Bring it in.

990
00:59:27,937 --> 00:59:30,498
- That's good.
Let's go.<i> Vamos.</i>
- Come on.

991
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,939
Two rounds down,

992
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:34,975
but it's clearly not the fight
any of us expected.

993
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:37,175
Stay in it,<i> mijo.</i>

994
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:38,473
Another shot to that left arm.

995
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,985
Things are starting
to get very ugly.

996
00:59:44,987 --> 00:59:47,350
-Chavez is in
some serious trouble.
- Hands free. Stop!

997
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:50,155
-I gotta take her, D, okay?
-Okay.

998
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:52,322
There's no such thing
as defeat. Let's go.

999
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:53,422
This is dangerous.

1000
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,193
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...

1001
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:57,360
-Move. Move!
-...and Chavez
is getting demolished.

1002
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:11,275
Oh, what a shot by Anderson.
Down goes Chavez.

1003
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,784
<i>Chavez is not getting back up.</i>

1004
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:16,885
Oh, no.
You don't wanna see that.

1005
01:00:16,887 --> 01:00:18,689
Chavez is down

1006
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:21,318
-and appears
to be badly hurt.
-No, no, no.

1007
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,155
- Felix!

1008
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:25,058
Ladies and gentlemen...

1009
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,994
-<i> ¿Que paso?</i>
-...our referee in charge,

1010
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:29,194
-Russell Mora,
stops the contest.
- Call the paramedics!

1011
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:31,658
He is the winner...
-Doc, is he gonna be okay?

1012
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,462
...by way
of spectacular knockout

1013
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:37,565
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1014
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:41,536
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

1015
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:44,781
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1016
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:47,608
Right? What?

1017
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,511
All right, Duke.
We gotta make this right.

1018
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,678
-Whatever I can do...
-No.
I told you, dawg, already.

1019
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,614
Ain't no making nothing right.
Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1020
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,253
-I can fix it.
-No!

1021
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:30,255
-You can't.

1022
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:33,093
You stay away from the gym.
You do that.
And stay away for a while.

1023
01:02:02,894 --> 01:02:04,454
Hey, Ma.

1024
01:02:04,456 --> 01:02:05,961
How's Felix?

1025
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:09,591
He's still at the hospital.

1026
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,593
He's stable.

1027
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:15,465
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.

1028
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:16,532
Mm-hmm.

1029
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:18,501
May be smart.

1030
01:02:24,113 --> 01:02:25,277
What's all this?

1031
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:29,710
They're from Damian.

1032
01:02:44,364 --> 01:02:46,496
You kept these from me?

1033
01:02:46,498 --> 01:02:48,300
To help you move on,
yes, I did.

1034
01:02:53,505 --> 01:02:54,537
Mama, how could you?

1035
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:58,948
I was trying to protect you.

1036
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,345
Protect me from what?

1037
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:02,281
Damian was my brother.

1038
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,217
No, Donnie.

1039
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:06,989
Not in that facility
where you were caged
like an animal.

1040
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,222
Did you think
that I was gonna
let you go back to that?

1041
01:03:09,224 --> 01:03:11,752
You made him think
I abandoned him.

1042
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,228
Do you know
what we went through?

1043
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,164
I know who that man was
the two of you beat up.

1044
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:20,233
You know Leon?

1045
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:28,538
Yeah.

1046
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,377
Then you know Damian
had my back before
you even knew who I was.

1047
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,643
Dame treated me
more like family
than your two kids

1048
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:35,743
ever did in this house.

1049
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,888
And you took that
away from me.

1050
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,780
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

1051
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,356
You're absolutely right.

1052
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:48,030
None of it.

1053
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,396
You hit hard, Donnie.

1054
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:54,630
And you can't see.

1055
01:03:57,569 --> 01:03:59,767
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.

1056
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:04,574
But that's not
what he's doing now.

1057
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:39,906
Excuse me.

1058
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:42,612
Yo, Dame. Dame.

1059
01:04:42,614 --> 01:04:44,449
-Hey, man.
-Get your hands off me.

1060
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,286
Get your hands off me!

1061
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:48,255
Hold up.

1062
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:51,489
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1063
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:53,854
Give me that.

1064
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:00,467
That's what we on?

1065
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:04,733
What's up, Donnie?
You all right?
You look tidy, bro.

1066
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,537
Man. Nah, nah,
you tell me, bro.

1067
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,837
You've been playing me
this whole time.

1068
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,280
Guess you did
get them letters, huh?

1069
01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:14,314
Why'd you lie to me?

1070
01:05:15,317 --> 01:05:18,087
I vouched for you.

1071
01:05:18,089 --> 01:05:20,221
I brought you
into my home, bro.
You met my family.

1072
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:24,522
I put money up for you.

1073
01:05:24,524 --> 01:05:26,425
-Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.
-All right. That's enough.

1074
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:28,856
You feel me?

1075
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:32,332
You put the gloves
on my hands?

1076
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,466
Oh, homey.

1077
01:05:35,304 --> 01:05:36,699
You must be punchy.

1078
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:42,705
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1079
01:05:42,707 --> 01:05:45,279
Get your shit
and get out the gym.

1080
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:47,974
Oh, Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1081
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:48,909
You think I need you?

1082
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:53,551
No. When I got locked up,
I needed you.

1083
01:05:53,553 --> 01:05:57,159
When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.

1084
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:00,327
But look around, bro.

1085
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:04,529
-I'm the champ!
- Yeah!

1086
01:06:04,531 --> 01:06:07,532
And I don't need you
for nothing or... or nothing.

1087
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:12,108
Who alone now?

1088
01:06:17,379 --> 01:06:20,215
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1089
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:22,151
Run away.
That's the one thing
you still good at,

1090
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:23,878
Baby Creed.

1091
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:30,225
What was that?

1092
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,030
-What'd you call me?
-Oh, you mad?

1093
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:36,528
You mad?

1094
01:06:38,598 --> 01:06:39,927
Try spending
half your life in a cell

1095
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,929
watching somebody else
live your life.

1096
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:45,636
You turned your back on me,
homey.

1097
01:06:48,575 --> 01:06:50,212
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1098
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,413
Hey, come here.

1099
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:54,546
Remember this?

1100
01:06:56,121 --> 01:06:57,417
This title?

1101
01:06:57,419 --> 01:06:59,881
All this?

1102
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:01,949
Hey, I'm just getting started,
little brother.

1103
01:07:03,425 --> 01:07:04,985
I'm coming for it all.

1104
01:07:06,362 --> 01:07:07,955
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1105
01:07:08,793 --> 01:07:09,957
Are you threatening me?

1106
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:17,899
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1107
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:20,572
Just promises here, homey.

1108
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,609
Come here. Let's see.

1109
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:25,973
-Get your hands off me.
-Oh, you all right.

1110
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:31,847
Yeah.

1111
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,014
Help yourself up for once.

1112
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:36,489
See how it feel.

1113
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:54,507
Aloha!

1114
01:08:05,421 --> 01:08:06,519
Where were you all night?

1115
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:12,327
You didn't get
any of my calls then,
or this morning?

1116
01:08:17,466 --> 01:08:19,092
What happened to your eye?

1117
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:19,895
Nothing.

1118
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,504
Are you okay?

1119
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,146
Not today.
I ain't got time
for a therapy session.

1120
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,480
Okay. Well, then
what do you have time for?

1121
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:35,878
Let me know.

1122
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,452
Because I have been trying
to talk to you for
a really long time, Donnie.

1123
01:08:38,454 --> 01:08:39,486
All right?

1124
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,523
Please, can you tell me
what is going on.

1125
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:46,053
Is it me?

1126
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,891
No.
It's nothing to do with you.

1127
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,098
Is it about Leon?

1128
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:02,773
What? Who told you that?

1129
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:06,106
Dame.

1130
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,945
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?

1131
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:16,919
D, you have got to
open up at some point.

1132
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:19,427
I don't know what else
to tell you.
I need to understand.

1133
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:21,594
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?

1134
01:09:21,596 --> 01:09:23,156
Some sad story?

1135
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:25,235
You're trying
to feel sorry for me
or something?

1136
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:27,270
I don't wanna
feel sorry for you!
I wanna understand you!

1137
01:09:27,272 --> 01:09:29,668
I wanna know
what is going on with you
in my house!

1138
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,572
There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna
talk about anything!

1139
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:34,541
I've been trying to forget it!

1140
01:09:34,543 --> 01:09:37,775
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!

1141
01:09:37,777 --> 01:09:39,579
I'm not talking
about that shit no more.

1142
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:52,185
You figure out your shit, D.

1143
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:56,332
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1144
01:09:58,226 --> 01:09:59,434
Do you understand?

1145
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,063
yeah.

1146
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:57,657
<i> Hey, what y'all doing</i>
<i>in there?</i>

1147
01:10:58,363 --> 01:11:00,627
Dame! Adonis!

1148
01:11:00,629 --> 01:11:02,464
- Stop!
- Come on! Fight me!

1149
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,597
<i> Leon, I'm sorry!</i>

1150
01:11:03,599 --> 01:11:04,895
<i>Y'all are so tough, huh?</i>

1151
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,812
-<i> Leon?</i>
-<i> Huh?</i>

1152
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:22,418
<i>Don't remember me, do you?</i>

1153
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:33,495
Hey, get off him!

1154
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,892
Yeah, you know what it is,
homey.

1155
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,506
- Dame!
-Step away from the gun.

1156
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,068
-Step away from the gun.
-It's down.

1157
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:47,168
It's down! It's down.

1158
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,048
-Hey, Mama.
-<i> Adonis, baby.</i>

1159
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,852
<i>You gotta get here right away.</i>

1160
01:12:00,854 --> 01:12:03,316
<i>Mama had another stroke.</i>

1161
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:06,319
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>multiple organ failures.</i>

1162
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:09,190
<i>I don't know, D.</i>
<i>I think it's...</i>

1163
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,258
<i>I think it might be time</i>
<i>to say goodbye.</i>

1164
01:12:13,438 --> 01:12:15,262
Mama?

1165
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,169
Mom, I'm sorry.

1166
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,105
-What?
-I didn't mean it.

1167
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:25,415
I didn't mean it.

1168
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:26,647
Mm-mmm.

1169
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:30,387
-The day I met you.

1170
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:34,116
Ooh, that face.

1171
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,352
Mmm. You were so mad.

1172
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:45,468
Gonna knock everybody out,
one by one.

1173
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,129
Just like your father.

1174
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:52,673
That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?

1175
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:55,368
Yeah.

1176
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:59,339
But you-- you don't have
to do that.

1177
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,145
You can find another way.

1178
01:13:04,786 --> 01:13:06,280
Yeah.

1179
01:13:07,954 --> 01:13:10,119
Yeah, another way.

1180
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,429
Another way.

1181
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,498
I was angry.

1182
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,436
I was so angry
when you left me, Apollo.

1183
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:28,005
Why did you leave me alone?

1184
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,307
Adonis.

1185
01:13:34,684 --> 01:13:36,651
That's his name.

1186
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:38,950
I'm right here.

1187
01:13:38,952 --> 01:13:41,821
He saved me, Apollo.

1188
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:47,662
He helped me to forgive you.

1189
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:49,389
Mom, I'm sorry.

1190
01:13:51,162 --> 01:13:52,634
Just tell me what to do.

1191
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:56,968
Okay?

1192
01:13:58,037 --> 01:13:59,839
Adonis.

1193
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:03,205
Adoni--

1194
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:36,463
I'm sorry.

1195
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:40,335
I know.

1196
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:44,471
It's okay.

1197
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:45,505
No, it's not.

1198
01:15:47,113 --> 01:15:48,178
It's just...

1199
01:15:49,247 --> 01:15:50,345
when Dame came back...

1200
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:57,121
all this shit came back too.

1201
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,354
I didn't know
how to handle it.

1202
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,325
But you were always
really good at that.

1203
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:05,998
Feelings.
It comes easy to you.

1204
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,670
Doesn't come easy to me.

1205
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:10,167
Doesn't.

1206
01:16:11,973 --> 01:16:15,007
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1207
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:18,340
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

1208
01:16:18,342 --> 01:16:20,111
You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing

1209
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:22,080
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.

1210
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:23,543
I could talk to her.

1211
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:25,347
Now she's gone.

1212
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:33,157
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1213
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:36,028
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined
that they would.

1214
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:40,131
And that still hurts me.

1215
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:43,365
A lot.

1216
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:49,602
But I just made a choice
to try to move on

1217
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:51,571
and be happy
about what I do have.

1218
01:16:56,644 --> 01:16:58,413
But it's not easy.

1219
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,154
I just try.

1220
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:19,940
Leon...

1221
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,043
was the dad at the group home

1222
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:26,683
where I lived with Dame.

1223
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:32,755
I'm not saying me
and Dame were angels.

1224
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,825
Okay? But...

1225
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,619
no kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.

1226
01:17:40,996 --> 01:17:41,764
You feel me?

1227
01:17:43,658 --> 01:17:46,967
That night
at the liquor store,
I saw Leon.

1228
01:17:51,072 --> 01:17:52,203
And I snapped.

1229
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,714
And I hit him.

1230
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,916
I kept hitting him.

1231
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:07,284
And his boys jumped on me.

1232
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:10,727
So Dame pulled a gun.

1233
01:18:12,423 --> 01:18:13,455
Cops pulled up.

1234
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,062
We tried to run.

1235
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,835
Dame got caught. I got away.

1236
01:18:22,972 --> 01:18:24,433
I ran.

1237
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:27,073
You were a kid.

1238
01:18:28,813 --> 01:18:32,375
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.

1239
01:18:32,377 --> 01:18:35,477
And Dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.

1240
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:37,512
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.

1241
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,087
I never called.

1242
01:18:41,892 --> 01:18:42,957
I didn't write.

1243
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:51,658
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1244
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:53,770
You know, just...

1245
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,807
act like it never happened.

1246
01:18:57,809 --> 01:19:00,634
But that doesn't
make you responsible
for how his life turned out.

1247
01:19:04,112 --> 01:19:06,475
You are a good man, Adonis.

1248
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:09,676
I don't know anymore.

1249
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,920
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,

1250
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:16,353
so that you can begin
to believe that you deserve
the life that you have earned.

1251
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,620
Because you do.

1252
01:19:21,294 --> 01:19:23,558
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1253
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,133
But, B, he's not gonna stop.

1254
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:28,563
Then you make him.

1255
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:32,633
There's only one way
that Dame's gonna listen.

1256
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,014
If that's what you gotta do,
then...

1257
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:42,951
all right.

1258
01:19:42,953 --> 01:19:45,514
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion
of the world.

1259
01:19:45,516 --> 01:19:48,352
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1260
01:19:48,354 --> 01:19:50,783
The one and only Adonis Creed
is sitting right next to me.

1261
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:52,356
Welcome to the show, my man.
How you doing?

1262
01:19:52,358 --> 01:19:54,127
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1263
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:56,063
Yeah...
...thank you for being here.

1264
01:19:56,065 --> 01:19:59,132
You called to be on this show,
which you've never done.

1265
01:19:59,134 --> 01:20:02,003
I wanna know why you felt
the need

1266
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:03,972
to come on national television
today to speak.

1267
01:20:03,974 --> 01:20:05,039
What's on your mind?

1268
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:06,975
When I walked away
from boxing,

1269
01:20:06,977 --> 01:20:09,142
-I walked away
with some unfinished business.
-Mmm.

1270
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:11,914
Gotta be talking about Dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1271
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,476
Let's just get this
out of the way.

1272
01:20:13,478 --> 01:20:14,708
You know I believe
you're the best

1273
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,314
pound-for-pound fighter
in the world,

1274
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:18,250
three years ago.

1275
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,812
It's been a minute
since you've been
out in these streets,

1276
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:21,649
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying
about you.

1277
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,354
<i>Conlan.</i>

1278
01:20:23,356 --> 01:20:25,059
<i>He was beyond his prime</i>
<i>when you beat him.</i>

1279
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:26,423
<i>Dame.</i>

1280
01:20:26,425 --> 01:20:28,997
<i>He's the next king of boxing.</i>
<i>Not you. Okay?</i>

1281
01:20:28,999 --> 01:20:31,362
<i>Every time you turn around,</i>

1282
01:20:31,364 --> 01:20:33,265
<i>Dame is talking</i>
<i>about you dirty,</i>
<i>and unapologetically.</i>

1283
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:35,036
Hey, turn that up.

1284
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,368
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1285
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:38,765
he talks about your family.

1286
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:40,437
He talks about
how you can't be trusted,

1287
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:41,944
and that you run out
on your boys.

1288
01:20:41,946 --> 01:20:43,539
No, no. No.
Wait. Let me just...

1289
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:45,409
Hold on.
We got a call coming in.

1290
01:20:45,411 --> 01:20:47,609
We got a call.
Put him on, right now.

1291
01:20:47,611 --> 01:20:49,380
Hey, what up, little homey?

1292
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:50,777
<i>You want a tissue?</i>

1293
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,515
<i>Want me to come on there</i>
<i>and give you a hug?</i>

1294
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:54,748
<i>Aight, look, I'm just telling</i>
<i>everybody who you really are.</i>

1295
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,058
<i>-How you run out on family.</i>

1296
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,590
Dame, uh, not like this.

1297
01:21:01,592 --> 01:21:02,855
<i>This ain't the way</i>
<i>to handle it.</i>

1298
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:05,099
Oh, bad news, bro.
This is live.

1299
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:07,134
So, I mean, this how
we gonna handle it now.

1300
01:21:07,136 --> 01:21:09,037
<i>Little Donnie</i>
<i>ain't got nothin'.</i>
<i>He a coward.</i>

1301
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:11,864
You a coward, bro,
and a fraud.

1302
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:13,701
I know it.
Everybody else know it.

1303
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:16,275
Hey, Apollo Creed
would be ashamed.

1304
01:21:16,277 --> 01:21:17,474
Oh, you lost it.

1305
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:20,081
Aight.

1306
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,446
I challenge you
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1307
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:23,986
You and me?

1308
01:21:23,988 --> 01:21:25,746
-Run it.
-Run it!

1309
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:27,990
Oh, hell yes.
Y'all heard it here first.

1310
01:21:27,992 --> 01:21:29,618
<i>I know I can't wait for this.</i>

1311
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,883
There you go.
What's up, champ?

1312
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,918
- What's going on?
- Prime time.

1313
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,459
The champ is here!
Y'all better turn it up.

1314
01:21:35,461 --> 01:21:37,098
Here we go, folks.

1315
01:21:40,631 --> 01:21:41,696
Let's get reacquainted.

1316
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,278
Fractured fourth
and fifth metacarpals.

1317
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,247
Both hands.

1318
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:55,116
His eye socket broke.

1319
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,051
Ruptured kidney.

1320
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,846
-His shoulder don't work.
- Torn abductor.

1321
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,255
He don't got it no more.
He retired. He probably
won't even make weight.

1322
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:04,125
And remind me,
how many concussions
have you had?

1323
01:22:10,496 --> 01:22:13,266
You're old, and you're broken.

1324
01:22:13,268 --> 01:22:16,368
We know Dame.
Dame gonna have
this damn list memorized.

1325
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:20,009
<i>He's willing to do anything</i>
<i>to win, so you gotta</i>
<i>be prepared for everything.</i>

1326
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:23,771
We can't turn back the clock,
we can't hide all your flaws,

1327
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:25,674
but we can make 'em strengths.

1328
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,353
That's it. Two jabs.

1329
01:22:34,355 --> 01:22:35,783
-Come under.
-Slip.

1330
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:36,850
One-one-two.

1331
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:38,192
-I got you.
-Let's go, D.

1332
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:41,558
The higher you get,
the harder it gets.

1333
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,165
That's life. That's this run!

1334
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,793
-Let's go.

1335
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:48,730
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1336
01:22:48,732 --> 01:22:50,798
Right here. Let's go.
Over and over.

1337
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,898
Push.

1338
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,174
Push!

1339
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:56,375
What you looking back, boy?
Look forward.

1340
01:22:56,377 --> 01:22:58,003
Who slips like this?
Nobody. Bring it in.

1341
01:22:58,005 --> 01:22:59,774
Ain't nobody gonna
take it easy on him, right?

1342
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:02,711
Come on. Focus up.

1343
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,126
There you go.

1344
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:13,557
There you go.

1345
01:23:15,396 --> 01:23:16,197
Come on, man.

1346
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:18,892
Stop thinking so much, man.

1347
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:20,201
Get your head in the game.

1348
01:23:22,535 --> 01:23:25,107
You see that man right there?
Do you remember him?

1349
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:29,606
You gotta block out everything
and be in the moment.

1350
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:32,345
Not the past. Not the future.

1351
01:23:32,347 --> 01:23:33,379
Right now.

1352
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:36,745
Let's go. Come on.

1353
01:23:36,747 --> 01:23:37,779
Well...

1354
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:40,683
Hey.

1355
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:42,784
-How's the...
-Nah, nah. Don't. Don't.

1356
01:23:42,786 --> 01:23:44,192
But you're good?

1357
01:23:44,194 --> 01:23:46,227
Good enough to beat you.

1358
01:23:59,308 --> 01:24:00,175
Keep your hands up.

1359
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,002
Move. Move!

1360
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,246
You can go home, dawg.

1361
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:19,755
Maybe we should take a break.

1362
01:24:19,757 --> 01:24:20,789
Take a break?

1363
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:26,228
Where you goin'?

1364
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:30,056
I'm just getting started.

1365
01:27:03,624 --> 01:27:04,425
I see you, boy.

1366
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:11,124
Whoo! We're out here working
right now!

1367
01:27:13,733 --> 01:27:15,997
Where is he? Where is he?

1368
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:17,438
I see you.

1369
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,796
Let's do it, baby!
Let's go! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1370
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:47,633
There you go! There you go!

1371
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:07,653
Let's go!

1372
01:28:14,695 --> 01:28:16,695
Welcome to Los Angeles

1373
01:28:16,697 --> 01:28:19,830
for one of
the most highly anticipated
heavyweight bouts in years.

1374
01:28:19,832 --> 01:28:21,161
One step.

1375
01:28:22,329 --> 01:28:24,065
One punch.

1376
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:25,671
One round at a time.

1377
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:29,235
One step.

1378
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:31,270
One punch.

1379
01:28:32,647 --> 01:28:34,075
One round at a time.

1380
01:28:34,715 --> 01:28:36,044
One step.

1381
01:28:37,421 --> 01:28:38,453
One punch.

1382
01:28:39,687 --> 01:28:41,115
One round at a time.

1383
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:58,363
Creed! Creed!
Creed! Creed!

1384
01:28:58,365 --> 01:29:01,938
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1385
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,513
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1386
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,246
Whoa!

1387
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:14,720
Yeah, boy!

1388
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,140
What's up, LA?

1389
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,587
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening,

1390
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:30,218
and welcome
to the Battle of Los Angeles.

1391
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:35,421
The fight starts now!

1392
01:31:38,228 --> 01:31:40,602
Introducing first,
the challenger.

1393
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:42,868
Fighting out of the Delphi Gym

1394
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:48,071
and proudly representing
his home
of Los Angeles, California,

1395
01:31:48,073 --> 01:31:54,715
here is the former light
heavyweight and heavyweight
champion of the world,

1396
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:59,445
Adonis Creed!

1397
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,481
Creed!

1398
01:32:04,056 --> 01:32:06,056
And his opponent
across the ring,

1399
01:32:06,058 --> 01:32:11,358
he represents
the Crenshaw District
of Los Angeles, California.

1400
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,702
Here is the former
Golden Gloves champion

1401
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:19,267
and the reigning,
defending, undefeated

1402
01:32:19,269 --> 01:32:23,744
and unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1403
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:27,946
"Diamond" Damian Anderson!

1404
01:32:28,575 --> 01:32:30,718
Anderson!

1405
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,918
Creed retired
a champion, but he's
definitely the underdog.

1406
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,920
Yeah, there's no doubt
Dame has the upper hand.

1407
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:37,087
He looks to be
in phenomenal shape.

1408
01:32:37,089 --> 01:32:40,255
You both received
your instructions
in your dressing room.

1409
01:32:40,257 --> 01:32:43,324
I want a good, clean fight.

1410
01:32:43,326 --> 01:32:47,163
Obey my commands at all times.
Above all, protect yourself
at all times.

1411
01:32:47,165 --> 01:32:48,494
Let's go.

1412
01:32:50,267 --> 01:32:51,970
You on your own now,
little Donnie.

1413
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:55,776
Go to your corners.

1414
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:58,570
The intensity here is
like nothing I've ever seen.

1415
01:32:58,572 --> 01:33:01,749
Yeah, you can absolutely feel
the bad blood
between each other

1416
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:02,948
in this Battle of LA.

1417
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,789
- And we're off.

1418
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,793
And the big question here
in round one, how much
ring rust will Adonis have?

1419
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:14,828
Three years out of the game.

1420
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:18,425
And the way Dame attacks,
this could be over early.

1421
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:20,801
A little bit
of a cautious start
early on here.

1422
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:22,968
Still not clear yet
who's going to be
the one dictating.

1423
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:24,167
Stop holding back, D.

1424
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:25,707
You're giving him
too much respect.

1425
01:33:29,207 --> 01:33:33,011
Anderson gets
first blood with a nasty shot
to the arm of Creed.

1426
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:35,178
Both fighters
sizing each other up.

1427
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:39,314
And, boom, a stiff jab
to the face lands,
and Creed is gonna tie him up.

1428
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:45,617
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1429
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:47,355
You gotta commit, D!
Gotta commit!

1430
01:33:47,357 --> 01:33:48,587
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1431
01:34:02,009 --> 01:34:03,041
Come on, D!

1432
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:08,409
I'd give
that round to Anderson
with an impressive start here.

1433
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:10,752
All right, little Donnie.
I'll see you in a minute.

1434
01:34:10,754 --> 01:34:12,413
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

1435
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:15,757
Way to hang out there.
Wear him out.

1436
01:34:15,759 --> 01:34:18,419
Look, the boy a punk.
He see you not scared.

1437
01:34:18,421 --> 01:34:20,256
Now it's time for him
to start fighting dirty,
right?

1438
01:34:20,258 --> 01:34:22,192
Keep your head on tight.
Let him make mistakes.

1439
01:34:22,194 --> 01:34:23,589
He gonna make
a lot of them, all right?

1440
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,767
And attack those windows
when they open.

1441
01:34:25,769 --> 01:34:27,769
You throwing
power punches, champ.

1442
01:34:27,771 --> 01:34:29,661
-Pace yourself.
- I know
what I'm doing.

1443
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:31,003
Don't worry about me.

1444
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:32,873
All that money can't save him.
Believe that.

1445
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,040
You gotta wonder
if Creed's regretting

1446
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:36,877
his decision
to get back in the ring.

1447
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:39,176
Retirement sure seems like
it would be a lot more fun.

1448
01:34:41,213 --> 01:34:44,753
Round two
underway here
in Los Angeles, live on DAZN.

1449
01:34:44,755 --> 01:34:47,349
Let's see if Adonis can find
his championship form

1450
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:48,988
and make a fight out of this.

1451
01:34:55,425 --> 01:34:56,732
Stop running, Donnie.

1452
01:35:01,266 --> 01:35:02,298
Yes!

1453
01:35:05,732 --> 01:35:07,039
Yo, keep 'em up.

1454
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:08,601
What I tell you, huh?
Here he comes.

1455
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,949
-Come on, ref.
-Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

1456
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:18,083
That cheap shit
all you got, old man?
Can't beat me heads up?

1457
01:35:34,134 --> 01:35:35,265
You had enough, boy?

1458
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:41,040
Tie him up, baby. Tie him up.

1459
01:35:45,849 --> 01:35:47,046
You thought this shit
was gonna be easy.

1460
01:35:58,290 --> 01:36:01,324
What
an exciting close to round two
in the battle of LA.

1461
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:03,722
Both men giving us
some tremendous blows.

1462
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:06,164
That was better.

1463
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,430
Stay focused. You take him
where you need to go.

1464
01:36:08,432 --> 01:36:10,531
Keep punching through.
Leave him open...

1465
01:36:12,876 --> 01:36:15,437
Don't let this chump
control you.

1466
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:37,480
What did we just witness?

1467
01:38:37,482 --> 01:38:40,582
An incredible end to round 11.

1468
01:38:40,584 --> 01:38:42,353
This fight feels dead even.

1469
01:38:42,355 --> 01:38:44,289
You can feel the tension.

1470
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:46,852
This is history spilling
into the ring.

1471
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,558
What an emotionally draining
war here in Los Angeles.

1472
01:38:51,694 --> 01:38:52,726
Listen...

1473
01:38:55,368 --> 01:38:57,104
You out there boxing.

1474
01:38:57,106 --> 01:38:59,700
I need you to start fighting.

1475
01:38:59,702 --> 01:39:01,174
Go out there
and do what we came to do.

1476
01:39:01,176 --> 01:39:02,670
It's your time, champ!

1477
01:39:02,672 --> 01:39:03,935
It's your time to shine!

1478
01:39:03,937 --> 01:39:07,048
Let go of the fear.
You hear me?

1479
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:08,478
Let go of the guilt.

1480
01:39:09,349 --> 01:39:11,514
Let go of it, dawg.

1481
01:39:11,516 --> 01:39:15,881
Let go of whatever was
and walk into what is.

1482
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:18,323
Go out there and be ferocious!
Do you hear me?

1483
01:39:18,325 --> 01:39:19,555
Be ferocious!

1484
01:39:19,557 --> 01:39:21,722
Go out there
and be Adonis Creed!

1485
01:39:33,373 --> 01:39:36,176
And we're off in round 12.

1486
01:39:36,178 --> 01:39:38,904
Three minutes to decide
the heavyweight championship
of the world.

1487
01:39:44,087 --> 01:39:45,185
Mm-hmm.

1488
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,620
Yeah, baby.
Stay in that zone with him.

1489
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,958
Come on, ref!

1490
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:06,536
There you go, baby.
There you go.

1491
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:22,618
And Creed's down!

1492
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,125
-Neutral corner.
-Get up, Donnie!

1493
01:40:24,127 --> 01:40:25,588
A massive body shot...
-Four!

1494
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,787
...and he's down on a knee!

1495
01:40:30,133 --> 01:40:31,594
- Five!
-Get up, boy!

1496
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:35,136
Six!

1497
01:40:37,635 --> 01:40:38,931
-Get up, boy.
- Seven!

1498
01:40:44,378 --> 01:40:45,410
Eight!

1499
01:40:49,284 --> 01:40:50,349
Get up, D.

1500
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:54,012
Nine!

1501
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:56,014
And he's up!

1502
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:59,083
-Come to me. You all right?
-Yeah.

1503
01:40:59,085 --> 01:41:00,260
-You all right?
-I'm good.

1504
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:01,393
-Wanna continue?
-Yeah. Let's go.

1505
01:41:01,395 --> 01:41:03,087
There you go! Yes!

1506
01:41:03,089 --> 01:41:05,298
Creed beats the count,
but here comes Dame.

1507
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,629
Can he survive?

1508
01:41:10,437 --> 01:41:12,030
Let's go! Give it to him!

1509
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:21,842
Break, break!

1510
01:41:23,615 --> 01:41:25,450
Creed breaks the clinch.

1511
01:41:25,452 --> 01:41:27,287
He fires everything he's got!

1512
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:29,520
-That's it, D.

Walking Anderson down!

1513
01:41:29,522 --> 01:41:31,016
It's your time, D!
This is your time!

1514
01:41:53,139 --> 01:41:55,711
Anderson is down!
Anderson is down!

1515
01:41:55,713 --> 01:41:58,076
Yeah! Like that!
How about that?

1516
01:41:59,717 --> 01:42:01,849
Whoa!
Lights out! What a shot!

1517
01:42:01,851 --> 01:42:05,358
Adonis Creed is the new
heavyweight champion
of the world!

1518
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:13,696
Ladies and gentlemen,
this contest comes to an end

1519
01:42:13,698 --> 01:42:18,371
at two minutes and 12 seconds
of the 12th and final round,

1520
01:42:18,373 --> 01:42:21,066
for your winner by knockout.

1521
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:23,541
The fighting pride
of Los Angeles,

1522
01:42:23,543 --> 01:42:28,073
and once again
the heavyweight champion
of the world,

1523
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:31,285
Adonis Creed!

1524
01:42:46,896 --> 01:42:49,336
Adonis Creed has done it.
-Yeah!

1525
01:42:49,338 --> 01:42:50,931
- A knockout...
-That's what
I'm talking about.

1526
01:42:50,933 --> 01:42:53,406
...in the 12th round.
An incredible scene.

1527
01:42:53,408 --> 01:42:55,573
Yeah!

1528
01:42:55,575 --> 01:42:57,674
If there was ever a question
of who is the king of boxing,

1529
01:42:57,676 --> 01:42:59,412
let there be no doubt.

1530
01:42:59,414 --> 01:43:02,041
The Creed dynasty
reigns supreme.

1531
01:43:11,558 --> 01:43:14,218
Good.
Back training hard,
back getting back focused.

1532
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,087
Back for the next phase.

1533
01:43:16,024 --> 01:43:17,496
We're back in business.

1534
01:43:42,985 --> 01:43:44,259
We'll be in the hall, champ.

1535
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,051
Guess you did learn
a few moves without me.

1536
01:44:34,608 --> 01:44:35,673
Dame, I'm sorry.

1537
01:44:38,678 --> 01:44:40,012
All those years...

1538
01:44:43,045 --> 01:44:44,209
I never checked up on you.

1539
01:44:47,214 --> 01:44:48,213
That's on me.

1540
01:45:00,469 --> 01:45:01,492
We were just...

1541
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:05,538
kids, bro.

1542
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:14,844
It ain't on you.

1543
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:24,458
None of it.

1544
01:45:29,696 --> 01:45:30,959
Never was.

1545
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:35,062
Hey, D.

1546
01:45:38,738 --> 01:45:39,869
It wasn't on you either.

1547
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:06,896
Aight, go ahead then, man.

1548
01:46:09,571 --> 01:46:11,296
Family and everybody
waiting on you.

1549
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:14,101
Champ.

1550
01:46:26,379 --> 01:46:28,181
You know where to find me
if you need me.

1551
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:54,614
You know she's been waiting
all night for this, right?

1552
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:57,375
She looks good in there.

1553
01:46:58,345 --> 01:47:00,147
-Yeah.

1554
01:47:03,955 --> 01:47:05,053
-Hmm?
-You all right?

1555
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,561
I'm better now.

1556
01:47:21,973 --> 01:47:23,808
Okay.

1557
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:25,810
All right.
All right, all right.

1558
01:47:34,216 --> 01:47:37,624
-Ow! Ooh.

1559
01:47:37,626 --> 01:47:39,758
-Knock him out.
-Ooh!

1560
01:47:44,226 --> 01:47:45,830
Yeah.

1561
01:47:48,197 --> 01:47:49,394
No!

1562
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:05,014
Now we have
a new champ!

1563
01:48:09,515 --> 01:48:12,450
She's the champ!
She's the champ!

1564
01:48:19,668 --> 01:48:20,293
Mm-hmm.

1565
01:48:22,671 --> 01:48:23,736
Yeah.
